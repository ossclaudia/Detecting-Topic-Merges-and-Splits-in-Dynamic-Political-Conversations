Step 1: pass the bipartisan PBM reform package that Speaker Johnson removed from last year's bill at the last minute, under pressure from the health insurance lobby. That package includes de-linking PBM revenues from list prices in Medicare; requiring transparency in contracts & reimbursements; mandating reporting to the government survey that supports cost-plus pricing of generic drugs; and banning spread pricing in Medicaid, which routes taxpayer dollars to Fortune 20 health insurers

Step 2: tackle offshore Group Purchasing Organizations and specialty steering, which are the new frontier for PBMs' profiteering at the expense of patients. Congress must skate to where the puck is headed, and the PBM CEOs are already boasting on earnings calls about how much profit they will make by marking up generic drugs and steering them to affiliated pharmacies; or by colluding in Ireland and Switzerland to avoid US regulatory oversight
