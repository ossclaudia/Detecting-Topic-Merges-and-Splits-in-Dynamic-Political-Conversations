'1887633224974934510',"While American aviation is among the safest in the world, tragedies like the DC collision are unacceptable and we can always do better. This includes maintaining and supporting a robust workforce at the FAA. 

Unfortunately, just last week, the Trump Administration issued a hiring freeze across all executive departments and agencies, including at the FAA for air traffic controllers, who are critical in preventing collisions. Given this action and the havoc Elon Musk has been wreaking across various government departments, Musk’s comments that he intends to intervene in the Department of Transportation and the air traffic control system is deeply troubling. 

As someone who has long advocated for and worked with experts for several years on safety reforms and modernizations of our aviation systems, I strongly encourage Mr. Musk, whose own company has a troubling safety record, to leave this work to the experts.
