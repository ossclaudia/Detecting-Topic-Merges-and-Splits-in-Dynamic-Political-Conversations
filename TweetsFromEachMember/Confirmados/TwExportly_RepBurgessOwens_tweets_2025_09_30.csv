'1843273363625849126',"One year ago today was the deadliest day for the Jewish People since the Holocaust. Thousands of innocent civilians were murdered, hundreds of women and children were raped and butchered by Hamas terrorists, while hundreds more were dragged back to Gaza in chains.

Today, 97 hostages—including 5 Americans—remain captives of Hamas while Iran continues to prop up terrorist groups and launch missiles with the express goal of destroying Israel.

The United States will continue to lead with moral clarity and support Israel unequivocally in its mission to destroy evil, protect its people, and ensure the safe return of all hostages.

My full statement with the Utah Congressional Delegation:

This October 7th, we, the Utah Congressional Delegation, acknowledge and condemn the evil and depraved act of terrorism inflicted on the Israeli people by Hamas one year ago today. We call for the immediate return of all hostages held by Hamas and stand with those fighting the scourge of antisemitism in our world.

We pray for the return of the seven American citizens still being held hostage by Hamas at this very hour. We call for Hamas to immediately return all remaining hostages to their families with immediate effect.

We note that members of our delegation have met with family members who lost loved ones at the Nova Festival, and the many villages and cities near the Gaza border. We have met with hostage families and stand behind them both in action and in prayer.

We acknowledge that Israel remains one of our most important regional allies and a country with which we as Americans share much in common, and that this premeditated attack was acutely felt in Utah and across the United States.

We remain concerned over the increase of antisemitism in America over the past year, with rhetoric on our college campuses delving into gross tropes, conspiracies, synagogues, and houses of worship threatened with violence, even here in Utah.

We declare that the true intentions of the authoritarian regime in Iran are to destroy the state of Israel and sow chaos in the region through an extensive proxy network.

We continue our efforts to promote strong American leadership that rejects antisemitism at home and abroad, ends accommodation efforts with Iran, and supports the defense and security of the state of Israel.",en,Tweet,0,113,17,10,3040,2024-10-07 13:53:10,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZSfApTbMAECJKT.jpg
