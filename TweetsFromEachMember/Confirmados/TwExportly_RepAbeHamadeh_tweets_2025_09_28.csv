Perhaps just as important is the scar it left on our country.

But with that scar came a lesson—a lesson not only about what our enemies are capable of, but also what the American spirit is capable of.

As ACTUAL election guru @HvonSpakovsky was quoted as saying in @FDRLST,

""The PROVE Act is a step in the right direction, Election Law Reform Initiative and Senior Legal Fellow at the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies Hans von Spakovsky tells The Federalist.

“The typical civilian Congress was looking at [when UOCAVA was created] was, for example, a State Department foreign service officer in Europe for a several-year assignment who would return to his or her home in Maryland or Virginia or another state when that assignment ended,” Spakovsky told The Federalist. Spakovsky explained the legislation was surely not intended to permit expatriates, or other individuals who left the country and have no intention of ever returning, to continue voting.""",en,Tweet,3,106,41,24,48066,2025-08-07 01:58:40,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
'1953209694291435897',"Here’s some actual data for the self-proclaimed “Data-Guru,"" @Garrett_Archer.

UOCAVA Voting: The Critical Numbers

The military and overseas citizen voting data reveals some concerning patterns:

Volume Stats:
• Total UOCAVA ballots transmitted: 1,327,324

• Here’s the kicker: 70% went to overseas citizens, not military voters

• That’s the largest gap between overseas civilians and uniformed services since 2014

Geographic Concentration: The report confirms what we’ve suspected - nearly half of all UOCAVA voters claim legal voting residence in just four states. Meanwhile, almost half of jurisdictions reported having 10 or fewer registered UOCAVA voters. This concentration in select states raises legitimate questions about verification and oversight capabilities.

Return Rates: Only 68.4% of transmitted UOCAVA ballots came back - meaning over 400,000 ballots are floating around out there. The report notes this return rate actually decreased from 2020.

These data points reinforce why the PROVE Act’s enhanced verification measures for overseas voting make sense. When you’ve got 70% of these ballots going to non-military civilians abroad, concentrated in a handful of states, with declining return rates, that’s a system begging for stronger safeguards.

This is all sourced directly from the nonpartisan Election Assistance Commission (EAC) 2024 comprehensive report: https://t.co/aUB27Q047X?",en,Tweet,13,179,78,41,64613,2025-08-06 22:40:54,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gxsx3L6XwAA0zNT.jpg

Congressman Hamadeh received a situation brief from General Mazloum of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) — the US ally in the fight against ISIS.
 
The Congressman thanked General Mazloum and the interim government of Damascus for their continued assistance in the search for Kayla Mueller’s remains so she can finally be buried where she belongs, in her home state of Arizona.
 
With over 100,000 fighters - both Arabs and Kurds - trained by US-led coalition forces, the SDF is a key part of Syria’s future. For over a decade, it has protected the northeast third of Syria, and established a decentralized model that protects Christians, Arabs, Kurds, and others.
 
The SDF seeks time and space to strengthen their inclusive governance framework in Syria’s interim process.
 
This month, Damascus-SDF negotiations will resume in Paris with Trump Administration support, aimed at moving Syria away from the former regime’s failed approach of intimidation and retaliation and toward a system grounded in protecting the rights and freedom for all.

Representative Hamadeh has introduced the Veterans Readiness & Employment Transparency to improve access to - and responsiveness from - the Veterans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program. 

This bill will help veterans by:
•       Establishing a VR&E specific hotline
•       Each regional office must display a name, email, and number online for vets with VR&E questions
•       Regional offices are required to hold Q&A on VR&E with every school under their responsibility
Also, additional oversight of the waiver process is sorely needed. 

As a result, this bill:
•       Requires an annual report that breaks down vocational training extension waivers
•       Requires waivers to be approved or denied within 30 days of the veteran’s request for an extension",en,Tweet,4,178,38,17,15271,2025-03-07 22:24:01,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GleKEyMbwAEPNPn.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GleKEyQbIAASJ98.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GleKEyPbAAAZUr_.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GleKEyQbwAAtXZL.jpg"
