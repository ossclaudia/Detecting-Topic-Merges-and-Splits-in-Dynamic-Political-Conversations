'1965925141163982961',"Charlie Kirk was a man of God. Charlie Kirk was a man of the people. The world was not worthy of him.

As Hebrews 11 speaks about people who live with faith -

""What more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets, who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. Women received back their dead, raised to life again. 

There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection. Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were put to death by stoning; they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated—the world was not worthy of them.""

May we continue to pray for the Kirk family. Scripture tells us that what the enemy plans for evil, God turns into good. He has the power to do it, and may He work through us and in us.

This bill is a major step in continuing to advance President Trump's America First agenda, including:

- Funding for securing the border.

- Advancing our defense and military capability—including building a ""Golden Dome"" to protect our nation from ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic attacks.

- Extending tax cuts for American families and adding new relief for tips, overtime, car loans, and boosting the standard deduction for seniors.

- Repealing much of the Green New Scam while spurring investment in new, reliable energy production.

- Prohibiting taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood.

- Terminating the $200 tax on firearm suppressors.

- Addressing waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid, including:

Work requirements for able-bodied adults 18 to 65 without dependents.
Cuts back on the provider tax money laundering scheme.
Implements protections to keep illegal immigrants from receiving Medicaid.

While we still have work to do to correct course on Congress's spending addiction, this bill enacts the largest mandatory spending reforms in history—it's a big start. This bill also includes conservative reforms that the pundit class said would be impossible to pass just weeks ago.

And while it may seem at home that there was a delay in bill passage, I will note that it was only 40 hours from passage of the Senate bill to passage of the rule in the House (signifying conference agreement). This time was used—in addition to traveling to D.C.—working through the night to evaluate the last-minute changes by the Senate and working with President Trump and his team to ensure the changes would not hamstring his agenda. We were also able to secure an agreement from Speaker Johnson that before September 30th, we will vote on a Balanced Budget Amendment.

Of course, we still have challenges ahead—especially in continuing to enact the fiscal reforms necessary to preserve the liberties and prosperity we have inherited for our kids and grandchildren. But this is a significant first step in reforming spending and a great step in advancing President Trump's agenda as together we work to Make America Great Again!",en,Tweet,2,75,11,20,1932,2025-07-03 21:26:42,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

House Leadership and the Sergeant at Arms have informed us that as a result of this change, ticketed guests will NOT be able to attend the ceremonies in person. The 60th Inaugural Ceremonies tickets are now considered commemorative memorabilia.

In his social media post, President Trump has encouraged inauguration ticket holders to view the ceremonies at Capital One Arena on January 20th. President Trump will report to Capital One Arena shortly after the conclusion of the swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. We have not received ANY information regarding admission and timing about this alternative but will communicate this when we are made aware. 

Please know that inauguration tickets do not guarantee seating or entry at Capital One Arena. Again, when we learn more information about the viewing at Capital One Arena, our office will let you know.

Capital One Arena is located at 601 F St NW, Washington, DC 20004.

'1876291635698340087',"Exciting News for the Coastal Bend!

I’m grateful to share that the bill I introduced to name the U.S. post office in downtown Corpus Christi after one of our community's most remarkable heroes, Captain Robert E. ‘Bob’ Batterson, was signed into law by the President—ensuring his legacy of service and sacrifice will be remembered for generations to come.

Captain Robert E. ‘Bob’ Batterson was a true American hero who dedicated 35 years of his life to serving our nation in the U.S. Navy. His remarkable career began when he enlisted in 1939 and included being stationed at Pearl Harbor during the attack on December 7, 1941—one of the most pivotal moments in American history. Following that, he earned his wings at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and served as a Navy Aviator during World War II, piloting F6F Hellcats in defense of our nation. After the war, he transitioned to the Navy’s Supply Corps, continuing his service until retiring in 1974.

In retirement, he remained deeply committed to serving his community, spending 26 years volunteering at the U.S.S. Lexington Museum in Corpus Christi. His dedication inspired visitors from near and far, especially at the Pearl Harbor exhibit, where he preserved the memory of those who served and sacrificed for our freedoms. Captain Batterson’s life exemplified service, sacrifice, and a love for his country and community. Naming this post office after him ensures his legacy will live on for generations.

May his story continue to inspire us all who walk through its doors, and may God bless the Batterson family. 🇺🇸",en,Tweet,0,25,3,3,1256,2025-01-06 15:36:00,"<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web Client</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgnSC75XcAAnpIQ.jpg

'1870515011262771259',"Reflections on the End of the 118th Congress and this past week:

Before my service in Congress, I am a husband, father, grateful American citizen, and voter. I could not have been more thankful for President Trump’s reelection, and I was thrilled to finally have a candidate worth being excited to vote for.

As many of you know, my faith is what motivates everything I do, including my service in Congress and my deep love for this country. Because of that, I truly believe God sparred President Trump’s life as an act of grace, giving us the opportunity to save America.

In President Trump, we finally have a Republican leader with a sense of strategy, leverage, and a vision for reforming the swamp. This, combined with the clear mandate of the election, should afford him broad latitude on policy and strategy.

However, the corrupt DC swamp continues to fight against the MAGA agenda, and Congress is structured in a way that inherently undermines it. That’s why we must have fighters in Congress who are willing to restructure the institution and challenge DC’s addiction to reckless spending so that President Trump’s agenda has lasting permanence.

When President Trump made it clear that he wanted to address the debt ceiling now—rather than waiting for the January/February reconciliation package many of us were working on—the answer for myself and many others who consistently oppose debt ceiling increases was, if the President wants it, then yes. We understood and respected President Trump’s strategic leverage play. The only remaining question was: How?

As I made clear to the Speaker in his office, I trust President Trump and his team. But I do not trust Congress—a body that has long been willing to raise the debt ceiling without delivering reforms. I, along with others, sought a commitment from fellow Republicans to ensure we would follow through on Trump’s much-needed spending reforms when the time came.

While we made significant progress, ultimately, we were unable to secure this commitment in the few hours we had to work before the vote.

Adding to the problem was the fact that we had an agreement from Speaker Johnson to pass the CR as single-subject bills which he retracted on after meeting with Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries behind closed doors. This led to more House Democrats voting for the CR than Republicans.

The chaos of this past week was both predictable and avoidable. Weeks ago, I and others warned of these pinch points and urged leadership to involve members in crafting solutions. Unfortunately, we were ignored and locked out of the process. It wasn’t the rank-and-file members who failed this week—it was a failure of leadership that brought us here.

Come January, we will need to revisit how Congress operates to ensure it is structured to deliver President Trump’s MAGA agenda. Whether that requires personnel changes, process reforms, or both will be a critical discussion we must have.

May God bless you and your family this Christmas season. I look forward to January 20th and the beginning of a renewed American Renaissance.",en,Tweet,22,871,213,164,90280,2024-12-21 17:01:45,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
