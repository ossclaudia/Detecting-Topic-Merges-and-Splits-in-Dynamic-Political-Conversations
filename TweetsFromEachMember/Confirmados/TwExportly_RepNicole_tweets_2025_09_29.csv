If implemented, this plan will only increase traffic and congestion, creating to longer travel times and unsafe driving conditions. Nothing is more asinine than taking a lane away from a highly traveled boulevard. Traffic has been an ongoing issue for Staten Islanders but, instead of making things better, City Hall continues to make things worse. Any proposal should have the approval from local community leaders and boards. This one does not and City Hall should abandon it. When it comes to these ridiculous ‘road diets,’ let Staten Island remain the forgotten borough. https://t.co/E9fvEzG6Hm",en,Tweet,0,20,6,10,3595,2025-09-23 13:54:59,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1iFzYAXQAAQqtC.jpg

'1970158120656609497',"The Trump Administration must reject Turkey’s push to reenter the F-35 program. President Erdoğan has openly aligned himself with Vladimir Putin, purchasing the Russian S-400 missile system and remaining the only NATO ally to not impose sanctions on Russia, while also supporting Iran, hosting Hamas leadership, and threatening to invade Israel. Turkey continues its aggression in the Mediterranean region, illegally occupying Cyprus and conducting illegal overflights above Greek islands. 

This is not the behavior of an ally. Unfortunately, Turkey has too often acted more like an adversary and handing over America’s most advanced stealth fighter jets to a government that works with Moscow and Tehran while embracing terrorists would be reckless and dangerous. It would not only endanger U.S. national security but also put Israel, Greece, and Cyprus at immediate risk. For these reasons, we urge the Trump Administration to block any such deal once and for all.

'1955651648782528937',"Early this morning, the DEP Brooklyn Water Maintenance team responded to a heavy water leak at 8774 24th Avenue between Bath Avenue and Benson Avenue. The water leak required an emergency shutdown of water in the area and 52 multi-family homes and 104 households are without water at the moment. Tow trucks have also had to remove multiple vehicles in the area, so DEP can conduct their investigation of the leak. We also notified National Grid and Verizon, as their services are nearby. 

We are in close contact with PS 101, which has been affected by this emergency shutdown.

Restoring public safety in our communities starts with New York City cooperating with ICE’s detainer requests. Failing to do so keeps dangerous criminals on our streets. I filed a Freedom of Information Law request that revealed just how far-reaching the consequences of these failed policies have become. The data showed that over 16,000 crimes were committed by thousands of perpetrators who were residing at hotels and shelters at taxpayer expense. The facts speak for themselves: sanctuary policies aren’t just misguided they are costly and dangerous.

""I applaud Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice for holding Governor Kathy Hochul, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and New York DMV Commissioner Mark Schroeder accountable for shielding illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in our state and city, including assaults on police officers, rape, and other violent acts. 

For too long, New York City and State has harbored foreign gangs, drug traffickers and illegal immigrants. New York’s Green Light Law even went so far as to block federal officials from accessing DMV records and has allowed illegal immigrants to obtain government identification without proper vetting. As a state representative, I fought and voted against the Green Light Law because it restricts officers under the Department of Homeland Security from accessing a database that could prevent a crime or hinder an investigation and also prohibits local law enforcement from sharing important data with federal partners.

Thanks to Attorney General Bondi’s leadership, New Yorkers will finally see their elected officials held accountable for their actions and failure to prioritize public safety.""",en,Tweet,5,166,33,25,4557,2025-02-12 23:48:52,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1843281953350410439',"One year ago Hamas terrorists, funded by Iran, launched a horrific attack on our ally Israel killing 1200 innocent people on the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. They also took 250 hostages including some Americans. Hamas cowards then used Palestinian civilians as shields leading to tens of thousands being killed. It is heartbreaking and it was 100% preventable. Four years ago, Iran was economically crippled by Trump-administration sanctions and not in a position to fund such a war. We must end the Biden-Harris policies of appeasement and return to peace through strength for the good of the United States, our allies and innocent civilians around the world.",en,Tweet,0,28,10,6,1430,2024-10-07 14:27:18,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
