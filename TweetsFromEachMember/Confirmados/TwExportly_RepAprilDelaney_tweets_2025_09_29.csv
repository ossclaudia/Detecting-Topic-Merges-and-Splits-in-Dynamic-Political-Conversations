'1969416238443930066',"As a communications lawyer and longtime nonprofit advocate, the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s show was jarring.  Freedom of speech, and of our press, underpins our democracy and who we are as Americans. 

Witnessing the FCC — an independent government agency — being weaponized to suppress speech critical of this Administration is unfathomable to me, and should be to all who believe in serving the public interest.  Without a free and independent media, the 4th branch of government, no one will know or speak out about injustice.

Our networks, regulators, and cultural institutions don’t just deliver content — they safeguard our ability to question or dissent. We must use this moment to recommit to protecting those freedoms, but also to protecting our country and its institutions.  And, this is one pivotal issue from which I will not back down.
