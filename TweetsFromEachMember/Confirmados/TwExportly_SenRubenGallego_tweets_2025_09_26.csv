'1955372932252700728',"Today I met with the family of Kelly Yu — a mother, wife, business owner, and job creator who is being held in ICE detention here in Arizona.

Kelly owns multiple restaurants and has spent decades contributing to our state’s economy and community. Arizona is not safer because she’s in detention, and it will not be better if she’s deported.

Kelly fled China in fear of her country’s one-child policy. Since then, she has done everything right to try and earn citizenship. But a few months ago, when she went to her routine check-in with immigration officials, she was handcuffed on the spot and taken away from her husband and daughter — both U.S. citizens.

Why is Trump doing this? It’s not about safety. In fact, we are less safe. Going after people like Kelly is a waste of resources. It’s pulling agents away from fighting child exploitation and drug trafficking. He’s doing it just to meet some arbitrary deportation quota.

'1937228616758370371',"The budget plan that Congressional Republicans are trying to pass is packed with cuts to programs that millions of Americans rely on, but one of the cruelest is cuts to food assistance like SNAP and Free and Reduced Lunch. These programs are lifelines for thousands of families in Arizona.

This is personal for me. When I was a kid, my three sisters and I relied on free lunch at school. That tray meant my mom could breathe a little easier and I could just be a kid.

That’s what Republicans in Congress are threatening to rip away from tens of thousands of kids in Arizona. These are kids who don’t have a lobbyist and who didn’t ask to be caught in a political fight but got caught in one anyway.

I'm not being dramatic; this isn’t a hypothetical. Under the budget that House Republicans narrowly passed last month, 63,000 Arizona families are at risk of losing some or all of their SNAP benefits. Kicking kids off SNAP will also make it harder for schools to qualify for federal school meal funding, impacting 121,693 Arizona students.

These cuts aren’t just bad policy. They’re a moral failure.

The United States is the richest country in the history of the world. We shouldn’t accept moms opening the fridge and having to decide who skips dinner like it’s normal. We shouldn’t accept second graders sitting through math class on an empty stomach. We have enough to make sure kids in Arizona get lunch at school and that families can put food on the table. We just have to decide that’s what matters.

'1934668402116972729',"There’s a lot going on in DC right now. But I want to sound the alarm on an issue that Republicans want you to forget: They’re trying to pass a budget that will strip health care away from millions of Americans to fund tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy. And if you think you’re paying too much to go to the doctor right now, it’s about to get worse. This comes at a time when costs are already too high, especially with Trump’s reckless tariffs.

Congressional Republicans are trying to ram through congress a budget bill that will make drastic cuts to Medicaid in U.S. history. If House Republicans get their way, more than 300,000 Arizonans will lose their health care, including 200,000 people on Medicaid and over 100,000 more who get their plan through the marketplace. On top of that, these cuts would force rural nursing homes and hospitals to close, push more people into overcrowded ERs, and cause over 1,000 avoidable deaths each year.

The Senate is currently negotiating their version of the budget plan, and even some Republican members know that these cuts would be political suicide. But the GOP’s top priority is keeping Donald Trump happy, and so they are charging ahead anyway with throwing working Americans under the bus.

These cuts will hit hardworking families, seniors, children, people with disabilities, and rural communities the hardest.

In the past few months, I’ve held town halls across Arizona to hear from families how much of a lifeline Medicaid is for them.

Here are just some of the stories I heard:

“I am begging you to advocate for Medicaid, especially for people like my son Parker, who is a child with multiple disabilities. Parker would not be alive today if it worked for Medicaid and all of the services that it provides children like him. Our family would not be able to sustain financially if we didn't have access to the services that it provides with therapies and medical interventions.” – Bridget in Phoenix

“I qualify for Medicare due to the rare disease I live with, in the beginning of the disease I was on Medicare before transitioning to Medicare. I live with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD), which requires ongoing treatments and medications to manage debilitating pain and maintain basic functionality. If I lost Medicare benefits, I would face impossible choices daily—skipping critical care, rationing meds, and plunging into financial ruin just to survive.” – Barbie in Phoenix

“My daughter was born in 2005 with a rare genetic condition that has resulted in many complex and life limiting medical conditions, along with significant cognitive and physical disabilities. She requires full care and assistance for every daily activity like dressing, bathing, feeding, etc. [...] I am a widow and an only parent to her. I have to work to provide a roof over our head and to try and give her a life she is deserving of, but I can't do it without the support and services provided by Medicaid.” – Dawn in Chandler

Bridget. Parker. Barbie. Dawn.

That’s who we’re fighting for.

Republicans are fighting for someone else. While their plan takes health coverage away from the people who need it most, it would give households making over $1 million a year an average tax break of $62,000.

This isn’t about reducing the deficit or cutting waste, it’s about rigging the system for the ultra-rich while hardworking everyday families pay the price.

I won’t let that happen.
