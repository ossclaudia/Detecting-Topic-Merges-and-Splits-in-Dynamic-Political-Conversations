'1966233110166602209',"At this moment, the nation is still in shock over the barbaric murder of a man beloved by millions. The depth of this tragedy is hard to process: a life cut short at age 31, a wife left without a husband, two young children without a father.

The tributes that have poured in these last 24 hours from people of all walks of life and all corners of the political universe – the raw grief, the remarkable eulogies – bear testament to a life of generational importance, a life cruelly limited in years but immeasurable in impact.

I offer my own most heartfelt prayers alongside the hundreds of millions of others in this country and around the world. As we pray for Charlie and his loved ones, so too do I pray for our country. 

We are in a perilous moment. We don’t yet have all the facts about yesterday’s horrifying events – and the killer remains at large. What we do know is that political division has continued to deepen in this country and that political violence is on the rise.

With a loss this profound, with evil this glaring, with so much pain and suffering and anger and fear – this cycle could escalate. But that isn’t where things have to go. This can also be an occasion for soul-searching as a country. 

A simple thing we can all do: if you have a friend or family member who you have stopped talking to because of political differences, this might be a good time to reach out. To say, we’re still friends, we’re still family. Politics isn’t everything. And politics itself, when properly conducted, can foster friendship and build community even among ideological opponents.

That’s what Charlie Kirk devoted his life to. He brought people of all perspectives together to talk to one another. To have a vigorous exchange of ideas. To discuss how we can best fulfill America’s promise. To participate in democracy.

At this moment, working to rediscover the capacity for unity is a matter of the highest urgency to America's future.",en,Tweet,15,362,59,43,6325,2025-09-11 21:11:18,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1966230814372298752/vid/avc1/1280x720/90uStQNiVyxV1uJY.mp4?tag=21
