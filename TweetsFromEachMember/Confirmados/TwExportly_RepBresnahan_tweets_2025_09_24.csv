I’m especially concerned about the impact on seniors in Lackawanna County, who are already facing a 33% tax increase imposed by their county government. That’s why I just voted for legislation to provide seniors with a tax break of up to $4,000 — to help ease that burden.  Local elected officials eager to help our seniors should be championing that tax cut and additional relief for our constituents.  

I will continue fighting for our most vulnerable residents, and my team will be in contact with the Lackawanna County Agency on Aging to ensure they receive full funding and support for their programs.
