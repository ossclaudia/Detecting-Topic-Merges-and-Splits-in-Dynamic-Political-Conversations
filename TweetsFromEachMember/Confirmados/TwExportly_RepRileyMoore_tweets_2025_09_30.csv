“77 million Americans demanded generational change in November. Today, House Republicans delivered on that mandate from the American people.
 
“Our One Big Beautiful Bill delivers major victories for the American people:
 
“It unleashes American energy like never before, repeals billions in subsidies for the Green New Scam, expedites permitting, and kills the radical EV mandates.
 
“It delivers the largest tax cut in American history by making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, eliminates tax on tips and overtime, and slashes taxes on Social Security payments.
 
“It sends critical resources to immigration authorities for border security and large-scale deportation efforts, finishes construction of the border wall, invests in 21st-century defense systems like the Golden Dome, restores America’s maritime dominance, and upgrades the nation’s air traffic control system.
 
“It invests in the American family by expanding the child tax credit, enhances the adoption tax credit, establishes federal savings accounts for new babies, defunds big abortion, and ends government funding for all sex-change surgeries.
 
“This bill delivers for West Virginia and the American people. We strengthened Medicaid for those who need it, cut spending by over $1.5 trillion, and will soon see our economy enter a new Golden Age. I’m proud to have voted “Yes” today, and urge the Senate to quickly pass this legislation and send it to President Trump for signature.”",en,Tweet,1,93,15,42,12338,2025-05-22 12:01:17,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

My full statement ⬇️

“For decades, foreign countries have enjoyed free access to the greatest consumer marketplace on the face of the planet, all while still charging our domestic producers hefty duties or imposing significant barriers to access their markets. Today that ends.

President Trump is the only president in my lifetime to acknowledge how unfair trade has gutted the heartland and shipped countless jobs overseas. By finally reciprocating in-kind, we’ll force foreign competitors to the negotiating table, lower trade barriers, and ultimately create real free and fair trade across the board.

I’m confident this move will boost our domestic manufacturing industry and fuel demand for American products across the globe.”",en,Tweet,13,786,136,99,37062,2025-04-02 22:49:40,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gnj7jHiWsAAaaxg.jpg

“It’s clear that the ‘commonsense revolution’ has already begun, and it’s producing major wins for the American people. Under President Trump’s leadership, America’s interests reign supreme. We’ve secured the border and are unleashing American energy like never before. We’ve slashed regulations and are rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. We’re eliminating DEI, protecting women’s sports, and ensuring radical transgender ideology is rooted out  of our education system. We’re making America healthy again.

“The future is indeed bright, but so much still has yet to be done. Under President Trump, we are ushering in a new golden age for America, and I’m proud to be fighting for it in Congress.
