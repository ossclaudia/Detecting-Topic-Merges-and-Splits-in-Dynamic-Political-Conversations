'1924898614276489305',"Opening Remarks - Congresswoman Nancy Mace
Oversight Hearing: Surveillance in Private Spaces

Liberty begins with the right to close a door. A hidden camera kicks that door off its hinges.

The Constitution’s Fourth Amendment enshrines a “reasonable expectation of privacy”. Yet today, that freedom is violated by secret cameras and hidden devices to record women and girls with impunity.

Freedom is not a theory; it is the right to breathe, to dress and undress, to sleep without someone’s camera filming your naked body. The Founders wrote liberty in parchment; hidden cameras erase it in pixels.

I speak not just as a lawmaker, but as a survivor. Starting on November 5, 2023, I discovered my former fiancé, Patrick Bryant, had filmed women without their knowledge, without their permission and without their consent.

He filmed rape too.

He appeared to catalogue the footage in the way he saved the files. And he stored these images for years.

This isn’t just creepy. It’s criminal—but only under weak state laws.

In South Carolina, first-time voyeurs face a misdemeanor and a small $500 fine. That’s not justice. That’s betrayal.

Real men guard a woman’s privacy; predators harvest it.

When predators install covert cameras or forge explicit images, they do not invade a room, they invade a life, and that life deserves more than a misdemeanor.

Exhibit 1: A screenshot of my naked silhouette—filmed in secret. The camera sat silent, yet it screamed my safety was negotiable and my dignity disposable.

Exhibit 2: An image of the building where women were recorded. [Enter into the record the Deed and short term rental documents.]

Exhibit 3: Screenshot. Just one camera I found had 10,633 videos saved on it at one point.

Exhibit 4: Screenshot. Evidence Bryant was transferring data off his phone—thousands of files.

He seemed to have certain fetishes of the women he catalogued: as they stood at the end of his bed undressed, sexual intercourse I’m very specific places in front of his hidden camera, and in specific positions, while they were changing, genital areas of women at the beach and pool, and at least one rape victim while she was unconscious.

He would even save a headshot of the victim next to a series of images of their private parts.

He kept the images for YEARS. One series of upskirt photos, he saved for almost ten years.

Exhibit 5: Various images of women filmed and photographed without their knowledge, their bodies redacted to protect their identity. I discovered up to four recording devices.

Exhibit 6: Screenshot. Rape victim unconscious. (with her face blurred, and with her permission).

These weren’t accidents. They were premeditated. Planned. Filmed. Stored. Meticulously Organized. Categorized. Catalogued. Private hidden folder. For YEARS.

At least two potential victims told me they once saw one of his cameras and he denied he was recording.

I would learn after finding these images, and speaking to potential victims, Bryant allegedly raped atleast 3 women.

We face an enemy that records first and apologizes never.

When I spoke up, Bryant didn’t apologize. He retaliated.

In fact, Patrick Bryant has started the process of suing his victims. Myself included.

[Enter into the record 2 Preservation Letters redacting rape victims names and other names.]

So let me be crystal clear: I won’t be intimidated. And I won’t back down, not for myself, and absolutely not for the women he violated for YEARS.

Predators like Patrick Bryant don’t ask permission, and neither should justice. A hidden camera does not erase liberty and doesn’t deserve a slap on the wrist.

Justice also does not crawl out of a plea deal, it arrives in a sentence that fits the crime and restores the victim.

Justice should come in the form of real sentences, real fines, and real protection for victims.

That’s why I introduced:

The Sue VOYEURS Act, which creates a civil right of action for victims.

The Stop VOYEURS Act, which expands the narrow federal prohibition on video voyeurism.

Secret recordings thrive in the shadows. These bills drag them into broad daylight.

Liberty is not theory—it’s the right to undress in peace. To live unrecorded. Without being filmed while naked.

Let’s make sure the law reflects that truth. We need laws with teeth. We need survivors with standing. And we need to leave predators with nowhere left to hide.

Today, I choose daylight. I invite every member of this House to step into that light with me, to pass these bills, and to prove that in the digital age liberty still lives where Americans stand as our forefathers promised.

I encourage other potential victims to come forward. Potential victims may contact SLED’s lead investigator directly at: Haley Nelson, hnelson@sled.sc.gov.

A tipline also remains active with the Congresswoman’s office at 843.212.7048 for those who believe they may have been recorded, assaulted, or otherwise victimized by these predators.

I would run through a brick wall to protect women and girls in South Carolina.

To other potential victims, I want you to know, “I have your back.”

“On behalf of Tri County S.P.E.A.K.S. (TCS), its Board of Directors commends Congresswoman Nancy Mace for her courage, strength, and bravery in publicly telling her own story, denouncing her abusers, and making credible allegations that many other girls and women have been victims of sexual abuse and violence. For over 50 years, TCS has provided much needed services for sexual violence survivors and advocated on their behalf. We know that it takes great courage for survivors to disclose a sexual violence experience and that it is essential to “Start by Believing” survivors when they come forward.

We were pleased to learn that the State Law Enforcement Division is investigating these charges, and we strongly believe that a prompt, thorough investigation is in everyone’s best interest.

We also commend Congresswoman Mace for continuing to raise awareness about resources for sexual assault survivors. In the week following her speech on the House floor, call volume to the Tri-County S.P.E.A.K.S. 24 Hour Hotline increased by 47 percent. Her webpage includes multiple resources for sexual assault survivors, including federal and state community resources.

TCS’s work continues because all too often, sexual violence remains undocumented and its perpetrators at large. We are committed to helping all survivors of sexual assault, and to working with local, state, and federal authorities and agencies to ensure survivors receive the support, assistance, and justice they need.”",en,Tweet,5,446,89,34,26483,2025-03-12 20:29:44,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gl3fyEIWsAEyZTi.jpg

Instead, the Left has turned this confirmation process into a partisan circus.

We cannot afford to be stuck in gridlock while the world becomes more unstable. From Ukraine to the Middle East, to China’s escalating aggression, we need capable officials at the State Department, DOD, and intelligence agencies to deliver peace through strength.\

At home, rising prices at the grocery store and gas pump have been crushing families for four long years. Treasury and Commerce nominees must be confirmed to deliver on President Trump’s economic policies—the same policies Americans overwhelmingly demanded at the ballot box.

Our energy independence must be unleashed. The Department of Energy needs to reignite American energy dominance and bring down costs for hardworking Americans.

Meanwhile, crime is skyrocketing, and wide-open borders are overwhelming our communities. DHS and DOJ nominees must be confirmed to secure our borders, support law enforcement, and restore law and order.

Suspending the debt ceiling entirely at this point would allow Congress to add an unlimited amount of debt to our already $36 trillion national debt for two years, with no reforms to rein in reckless spending. 

Suspensions or increases to the debt limit must be paired with spending cuts. I look forward to working with President Trump to enact the steep spending cuts ($1 to $3 trillion) paired with a responsible debt ceiling increase — through reconciliation. 

If we are going to raise the debt ceiling it should be paired dollar for dollar with Trump’s agenda to ensure the Washington establishment can’t skirt the America First agenda and go back on a handshake deal (which they always do).

If I’ve learned one thing from my time in the House, it’s that members of Congress on both sides of the aisle cannot be trusted with a limitless credit card to spend American taxpayer dollars.

This CR had the same level of spending today as it did yesterday, but the debt ceiling was suspended, meaning there was no limit on the debt. I don’t trust Congress or the government to spend responsibly without any limits.

I cannot in good conscience vote to continue Joe Biden spending levels months into Trump’s presidency.

If we did a very short CR that took us to Jan. 20th only or if we had single subject votes on the spending measures inside the bill - there likely would have been a lot more support. 

We are $36 trillion in debt. We have to get this right.

'1869752698817445945',"For decades, Democrats AND Republicans have engaged in massive reckless spending. This cycle of fiscal abuse must come to an end.

If we learned nothing else from the November 5th election, we learned the American people don’t want business as usual in Washington.

They want strong leaders who will stand up and say enough is enough.

I am standing up for my home state of South Carolina and every hardworking American fed up with Washington. 

We need a complete and total reset. A 30-day government shutdown is a good place to start. We can pick this back up after Trump is sworn into office.

Truthfully, a shutdown isn’t a shutdown. That’s a bs lie from the media and the establishment stoking fear in your face.

During a “government shutdown” the president has authority to prioritize spending; the Office of Management and Budget has a contingency plan to prioritize spending; and all mandatory spending is still funded (social security, veterans benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.).

I also have a bill called the Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2023. This bill would provide immediate stability by appropriating funding for 90 days at 99% of our current budget, with a gradual reduction of 1% per day thereafter.

It’s time to hold the line for our fellow country men and women, for our nation’s future and for future generations.

Shut it down.

What happened to me this week is just the latest example—then there are riots, death threats, and even assassination attempts which have become their playbook.

To the far left: your attempts to bully and intimidate won’t work. You’ve only shown us why we need to keep pushing back.

To every woman who has felt targeted, threatened, or unsafe: we see you, we hear you, and we’re standing with you. We’ll continue speaking out and taking action until every woman can live and speak freely, without fear.

This isn’t just politics anymore. This is about defending democracy and ensuring the safety and freedom of every woman in America.

'1866976253854511434',"Back in November, @RepLuna—a mother, a woman, and a true patriot—introduced a resolution to condemn the death threats against me, sending a message that violence is never the answer. Yet, it still sits on a desk somewhere. Now more than ever, activists feel entitled to invade our space, our bodies, and our voices.

We need this resolution on the floor. I implore leadership to act. Elected officials must be able to represent the values and policies their constituents sent them here to uphold—free from intimidation or fear for their safety. Congress must stand united in unequivocally condemning all threats of violence against its members.
