'1940841061301039600',"Today, I cast my vote to unlock much of the America First agenda that so many Americans demanded in November. With this crucial reconciliation package across the finish line, President Trump will be empowered to continue leading America into a new golden age.
 
The One Big Beautiful Bill will save the average family in North Carolina from a 22% tax hike and put an estimated $1700 back in their pockets. America’s economy will be strong because of permanent and enhanced tax policies that encourage large and small businesses alike to build new facilities, offer more employee benefits, and reinvest profits into more innovation. 
 
Farmers will win with a long-overdue investment in safety net programs that will ensure they can feed America for years to come. 
 
This bill gives President Trump the tools he needs to finish securing the border by providing $175 billion in new funding. It will allow for completion of the border wall, fund ICE deportation efforts, and hire and train new border patrol agents.
 
Common sense will prevail in many other instances throughout this package. It defunds Planned Parenthood abortion mills and eliminates the unconstitutional tax on short-barreled firearms and suppressors. Sadly, one provision the Senate removed was a prohibition on taxpayer dollars for transgender surgeries. 
 
While this bill isn’t perfect, I’m proud of my fellow conservatives for negotiating hard to ultimately achieve a bill with the largest cost-savings in our nation’s history. Key provisions such as removing illegal aliens from welfare programs, capping student loan programs, and instituting basic work requirements for able-bodied adults are an important step in the right direction. The bill would have been even stronger had the Senate not weakened several other fiscal reforms in the House version that would have done better by the taxpayers who are already on the hook for $37 trillion in debt.
 
I recognize to undo the damage done to our country by radical progressive Democrats, Congress must authorize the funds to accomplish that goal.  However, I fear that if Washington’s overspending addiction continues, the opportunity to put our country back on a path to a sound financial future is in jeopardy. In the coming months, Republicans must use every tool at our disposal to rein in government spending.

'1925506215188037670',"Today, I cast my vote for the America First agenda, empowering President Trump to lead our nation into a new golden age. While it's not perfect, this “Big Beautiful Bill” is an important step forward. It funds our border security, bringing in thousands more ICE agents, adding new detention beds, hiring immigration judges to streamline deportations, and completing a strong, secure border wall — fulfilling our promise to keep our communities safe and our country sovereign. It protects President Trump’s historic 2017 tax cuts which sparked strong economic growth by fueling job creation and family incomes, increasing the child tax credit, and implementing new tax policies like “No Tax on Tips” and “No Tax on Overtime,” putting more money back in the pockets of hardworking Americans. This bill also has the heart of America at its core, investing billions into our great agriculture industry to ensure they can keep putting food on our tables. It emphasizes the importance, and dignity, of work by requiring able-bodied Americans to work in order to be eligible for Medicaid and food assistance. And, it also defunds planned parenthood and taxpayer funded transgender surgeries in Medicaid.     

Over the past week, we have made some real improvements to the bill, and I had hoped that we could rally around eliminating even more waste, fraud and abuse to tackle our mounting national debt as it climbs toward $37 trillion. For example, Medicaid remains weighed down by misplaced priorities and state money-laundering scams. We also did not do enough to shut off the government subsidies to green energy companies.      

We owe it to our children and grandchildren to build a fiscally responsible future, and the bill could have gone much farther when it comes to getting our spending under control. On balance, however, this package is a win for the American people. But, it’s also a reminder that Washington still struggles to fully embrace the transformative change we so desperately need.

'1910350013089120535',"Today, I voted for the Senate Budget Resolution. I voted to move forward in the reconciliation process which must result in keeping taxes low for American families, fully funding our border security, and enacting historic spending reductions in return for raising the limit on our nation's credit card.
 
But our work is far from over. To put it simply, the Senate failed to do its job with this budget. President Trump won his election five months ago, and this is the best they could do? ""Trust us"" is not a plan when the people who are making promises to you are at least partially responsible for America’s $37 trillion in debt and annual deficit of $2 trillion each year.
 
But after meeting with President Trump at the White House, I am assured that he will not sign a bill that does not produce the spending reforms necessary to put our country back on the path toward balancing the federal budget. The final reconciliation package must be much closer to $2 trillion in spending reduction than a mere $4 billion for me to vote for it later this year. The House Budget instructions must guide both chambers during negotiations, or it will not be possible to deliver on our promises to the American people – which include reducing the size of government spending to set us back on the path to fiscal responsibility.
