Danny and his team are investing in rural Missouri, creating jobs, and producing a high-quality product that represents the best of American small business.

Mike and Paul highlighted how burdensome regulations—like the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) rule—tie up family farms with unnecessary paperwork and delays. That’s why I introduced the VFD Repeal Act (H.R. 5140) to eliminate this regulation and restore common-sense veterinary flexibility.

Farmers like Ryan are why I fight for improved market access for our agricultural products.

'1940086278197858522',"Today marks another significant step in getting this bill to President Trump’s desk and enacted into law. The One, Big, Beautiful Bill lays the cornerstone for President Trump’s economic agenda that will help usher in a golden age for American workers, farmers, and families, by delivering the largest tax cut in history, the largest cut to government spending in history, promote American energy dominance, and secure our borders.

Over the last two years, the Ways and Means Committee has heard from working families, farmers, and small businesses around the country about how important lowering taxes is to help them provide for their children, support their farms, and invest in their workers. The One, Big, Beautiful Bill not only blocks the largest tax hike on working families but also delivers an immediate tax cut as compared to what they pay today. Workers will see an increase in real wages by as much as $7,200 per year and a typical family of four will see their take-home pay soar by as much as $10,900 per year. More than 7 million jobs will be secured because of the pro-growth, pro-worker policies in The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.

House Republicans must stay united and pass this bill to deliver the generational change that 77 million voters demanded – better wages, lower taxes, more opportunity. As I have said, failure is not an option.

Let’s get this done for the American people.",en,Tweet,0,11,5,5,1164,2025-07-01 17:33:08,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
