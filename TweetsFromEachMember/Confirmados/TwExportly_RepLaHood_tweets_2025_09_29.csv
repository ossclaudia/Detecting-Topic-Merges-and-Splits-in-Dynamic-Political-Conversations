'1843372701357875282',"A year ago, Hamas carried out one of the worst terror attacks the world has seen in Israel, killing innocent men, women, and children, and capturing hostages. As we remember the over 1,200 lives lost, we continue to pray for the hostages that remain in Hamas hands, including Americans. In the wake of this devastation, Jewish Americans and Jews around the world have been the target of vile and unacceptable acts of antisemitism.

Since October 7th, Iran, and their proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, continue to launch constant attacks on Israel and the Israeli people. The United States has an obligation to continue our support for Israel's right to self defense and protect our troops in the Middle East from those who seek to harm us. As we commemorate this dark day and pray for those in harm's way, the United States must hold the terrorist regime in Iran and their proxies accountable.",en,Tweet,0,16,3,18,1738,2024-10-07 20:27:54,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1840091424240611669',"The world is a much better place without Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. I commend the effort to eliminate Nasrallah, who has the blood of countless innocent civilians on his hands, and the United States should stand with our allies in the face of terrorist threats. 

For years, Nasrallah and Hezbollah, an Iranian terrorist proxy, have sought to sow divide in Lebanon and the Middle East, disrupting ongoing efforts for peace in the region. In the years since the Beirut port blast, Hezbollah has obstructed the democratic process in Lebanon, prevented the formation of a government and election of an independent president, and blocked humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people. Hezbollah's proxy bidding for Tehran has decimated the Lebanese economy, propped up corruption, and prevented the people of Lebanon from exercising their right to sovereignty, stability, and democracy. 

Like many Lebanese Americans, both in my district and across the country, I share concern for the people of Lebanon and pray for their continued safety. The death and destruction in Lebanon falls squarely on the shoulders of Nasrallah, Hezbollah, and their backers in Iran. Hezbollah's influence in Lebanon must be extinguished to allow for a prosperous future of the Lebanese people. The United States must continue to support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to keep stability in the country and efforts to quickly open Parliament and allow the Lebanese to elect an independent president that will support the needs of the Lebanese people. 

I stand ready to work with the Administration, my colleagues in Congress, and the Lebanese diaspora community in America to support the work of a secure, independent and peaceful future for the Lebanese people.",en,Tweet,0,114,16,126,45436,2024-09-28 19:09:17,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
