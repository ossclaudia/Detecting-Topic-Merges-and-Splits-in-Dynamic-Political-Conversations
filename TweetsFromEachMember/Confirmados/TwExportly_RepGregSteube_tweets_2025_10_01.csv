I voted against a rule bill that undermined a Member’s right to utilize the discharge petition—a century-old tool that empowers individual Members to force a vote when leadership blocks legislation. @RepLuna used this process successfully, yet yesterday’s vote played games with that rule.

Back in December of 2023, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris stood idly by while 250,000 illegal migrants entered the United States.

Today, thanks to President Trump’s leadership, illegal border crossings have plummeted to a historic low with less than 9,000 illegal entries in February.

It’s now time for Congress to step up and finish the work President Trump began by passing a comprehensive border security package in our reconciliation bill.
Secure the border now.

I’m all for prioritizing federal spending, but where were these cautionary brakes when we decided to send $113B+ to Ukraine, $500M+ for Jordan’s border, and $72M in livelihood support for Lebanon (while they attack our ally Israel)?

'1841483235714281977',"This past weekend marked 2 years since Hurricane Ian devastated our district. Ian claimed 149 lives, making it the deadliest storm to hit Florida in more than 80 years, and remains the 3rd costliest storm in U.S. history.

Many in FL-17 are still working on long term Ian recovery, and have now suffered from Hurricane Helene’s wrath just last week. My office is here to fight every step of the way during these challenging times. If you need assistance with federal disaster recovery efforts, visit my website or call my office.

Just like we’ve rebuilt time and time before, we’ll do it again. Floridians are resilient.

'1841227265209700860',"How about we fully back Israel’s offense instead of just defense?

Why is this administration sending “humanitarian aid” that ends up benefiting Hamas and Hezbollah, while also easing sanctions that give billions to Iran? All the while, they undermine Israel’s strategy and response.

None of this happened under Trump. He refused to appease Iran’s terrorist allies like Biden/Harris are doing.

If you don’t want WW3, we need President Trump back in the White House.
