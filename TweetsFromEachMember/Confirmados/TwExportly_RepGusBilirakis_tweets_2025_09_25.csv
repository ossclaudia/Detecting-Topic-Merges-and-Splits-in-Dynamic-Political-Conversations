'1933604786848600392',"Synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, lead to nearly 70% of all overdose deaths, as the drug can be deadly in even small doses and is up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. In 2022, more than 200 people died from fentanyl and opioid-related overdoses each day – making fentanyl the leading cause of death for Americans under 50 years old.  Fentanyl claims more lives than heart disease, cancer, suicide, and homicide.  If the temporary order scheduling fentanyl related substances (FRS) ends, several FRS will become street-legal, law enforcement will lose authority to seize them, and drug traffickers will continue to funnel increasingly deadly drugs into the United States.  

This week, I proudly voted in support of the HALT Fentanyl Act, which permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances (FRS) in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.  It also ensure law enforcement has the resources needed to keep these drugs off the street and allows for further research of FRS.  We are doing everything in our power to stop fentanyl from claiming more American lives – everyone should support our efforts to halt this deadly crisis.

Despite the large amount of American energy it produces, fracking is under threat, as Democrats continue to attack American energy production.  A study conducted by the EPA under the Obama Administration found that fracking has had no “widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States.”  American energy production through fracking leads to lower energy prices for families and workers, boosts economic growth, and improves quality of life for Americans.
