'1953664472490377354',"As a general rule, when you’re able to prepare an ex parte injunction— a one-sided attack— you’re going to lead with your absolute best evidence. In this case, the judge fully rejected the accusations and found them insufficient to support any of the allegations.
 
Once again, Anthony Sabatini, who was my primary opponent in 2022, should be fighting at the ballot box— which he lost to me— but instead, he appears more interested in weaponizing his judicial system against a former political opponent.
 
It is tragic the way he continues to use people to serve his political agenda of attacking me. And once again, he has turned up empty-handed, with nothing more than fake news in his latest round of baseless attacks.
 
He has not provided sufficient evidence, no facts to support these false claims, and has wasted the time and resources of our hard-working law enforcement officers with yet another politically motivated stunt for his new office. 
 
We’ve seen this before, when President Trump was relentlessly targeted by political opponents with baseless accusations. The weaponization of the judicial system is an egregious affront to our democracy— and Sabatini should be ashamed for borrowing tactics from the radical left’s playbook. If political Lawfare can be used against individuals like President Trump and myself, what does that mean for the average American when these injustices strike across the country?
 
Is Sabatini trying to be the next Michael Avenatti? While the accusations are baseless, I sincerely hope he is not using his client as a sacrifice at the altar for his own political ambitions. 
 
Breakups happen, but it’s truly tragic when a washed‑up politician drags someone else into his vendetta. I wish Ms. Langston well and genuine happiness.

'1925581483596542240',"Early this morning the House of Representatives passed the One, Big, Beautiful Bill and it is now headed to the Senate. This achievement would not have been possible without the unwavering leadership of President @realDonaldTrump.
The One, Big, Beautiful Bill stands as the most significant piece of legislation in years, delivering on the mandate from the American People. It includes:

✅ The largest tax cuts in American history, including no taxes on tips or overtime and reduced taxes on Seniors’ Social Security.

✅ The largest investment in border security to ensure a permanently secure border.

✅ The biggest deficit reduction in nearly 30 years, achieving $1.6 trillion in mandatory savings.

✅ An unleashing of American energy dominance, paving the way for sustainable growth.

✅ Protections for Medicaid by preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits.

✅ A revolution in our defense capabilities with historic investments in cutting-edge technology, including the Golden Dome.

✅ A Made in America Auto Tax Break to support our domestic industries.

✅ An overhaul of our Air Traffic Control systems for enhanced efficiency and safety in air travel.

While we celebrate this victory, our work is far from over. I remain committed to right-sizing the government and ensuring that “we the people” have more control and freedom. I will continue to work tirelessly to promote policies that prioritize the interests of American families and strengthen our great nation.

With just 40 days left in Joe Biden’s weak presidency, there is a growing urgency to cross the border because migrants and criminal organizations know this will not be able to happen with President Trump back in charge.

Surely, this surge will bring an even greater flood of fentanyl, traffickers, and terrorists, further endangering American lives. This is in addition to Biden’s reckless “humanitarian parole program,” which has already enabled criminal migrants from countries like Honduras and Venezuela, nations that are dumping their prison populations into our communities.

On day one in office, Trump will seal the border through executive orders and launch the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. I look forward to a new Congress that will make these measures permanent through legislation to restore our security and sovereignty.

For far too long, the Biden administration has demonstrated weakness, allowing terrorism and fear to destabilize the region.

The incoming Trump Administration promises a different approach, one that will restore America’s place on the world stage by delivering ‘peace through strength.’ We’ll remind our adversaries what America stands for freedom and liberty.

'1865137943628714258',"The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor to terror, funding Hezbollah, destabilizing the Middle East, and pursuing nuclear weapons under the guise of ""peaceful"" programs. President Trump was right to impose harsh sanctions, label them a terrorist regime, and withdraw from the failed JCPOA in 2018, crippling Iran's economy.

Strength works and appeasement doesn't.

The Iranian regime has now launched a rocket with its heaviest-ever payload into space, raising more concerns about its nuclear weapons ambitions. This isn’t about exploration, it’s about intimidation. President Trump’s tough stance kept the regime in check.

'1852381850896937105',"I am honored to support the Puerto Rico Status Act as the 100th co-sponsor of HR 2757, which upholds the right of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico to participate in a self-determination process. This legislation is a significant step forward, authorizing a federally sponsored plebiscite that gives Puerto Ricans the choice between independence, sovereignty in free association with the United States, or statehood.

I am committed to this bill and look forward to supporting the choice of the Puerto Rican people. There has been a strong historic bond between Puerto Rico and the United States. The bottom line is that Puerto Ricans serve in the U.S. military, they deserve at least the option of statehood.

Israel’s successful military operation in the Gaza Strip, resulting in the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, represents not only justice for the Israeli people but a victory against global terrorism. The elimination of the mastermind behind the October 7th massacre, the deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, further weakens Hamas’ position and its extremist network.

Terrorist organizations, particularly their leaders, need to know that extinction is their only fate. With the leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah both eliminated, the Biden-Harris Administration must support Israel’s bold, strong, and decisive actions against Iran. As we continue to monitor the geopolitical alignment of Iran, China, Russia, and North Korea working against Western interests, along with their enlistment of proxy groups, it demonstrates how far they are willing to go to destabilize the globe. We must stand united with our allies, Israel included, against those who seek to undermine peace and security worldwide.
