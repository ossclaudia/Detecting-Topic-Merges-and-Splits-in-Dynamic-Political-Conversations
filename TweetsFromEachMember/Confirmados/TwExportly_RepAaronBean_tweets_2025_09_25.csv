For nearly 9 decades, Roller Die + Forming has been a leading producer of standard and custom roll formed parts all over the world. In roll forming, sheet metal passes through a specific set of matched rolls. Each set of rolls touches the passing metal and changes the shape resulting in the desired cross section.

The Green Cove Springs facility produces many different parts for various industries including heavy truck, bus, medical, and building products. 

With locations across the United States, Roller Die made the decision to relocate their headquarters to Florida as our state has the most business friendly climate bar none. 

During the tour, we discussed the jobs their facility brought to the region, the successes they are seeing via tariffs, and how the One, Big Beautiful Bill boosts American manufacturing. 

Included in the One, Big Beautiful Bill: 

✅ Full expensing for new factories and factory improvements to accelerate domestic manufacturing.
✅ Full expensing for domestic R&D to encourage domestic innovation.
✅ Full expensing for new capital investments, like machinery and equipment, to boost domestic production.

'1953833581341507849',"💡Did you know yesterday, August 7th, was National Lighthouse Day?

To celebrate, I attended the Amelia Island Lighthouse Grand Re-Opening. Built in 1838, this is the oldest lighthouse in the state and has stood watch over Florida’s coastline as a beacon of hope guiding vessels home for nearly two centuries. 

Last year, I got a call from my son who was serving as the Mayor and he informed me the lighthouse needed a new beacon. Our team immediately went to work joining colleagues from Northeast Florida and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary in the effort to refurbish her brilliant beacon. 

Thanks to the dedication of city leaders and the collaboration of our local, state, and federal partners, this historic renovation has come to fruition—restoring her beauty and safeguarding her legacy for generations to come.

This lighthouse isn’t just a landmark to me; it’s a part of my childhood, a symbol of the community that raised me, and a reminder of how lucky I am to call this place home.
