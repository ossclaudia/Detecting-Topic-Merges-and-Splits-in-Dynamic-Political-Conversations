'1953919209915695239',"Since the days following the attack on October 7, 2023, I’ve been clear: Israel cannot defeat Hamas without a political endgame for Gaza. That’s a core tenet of successful counterinsurgency operations, as we learned in Iraq and Afghanistan. A military occupation of Gaza with no endgame is a dead end.

Despite pushback from Israel’s military leadership, the extremists in Netanyahu’s government see full occupation as a way to cling to power, expel Palestinians, expand settlements, and pave the way for annexation. That is not a plan for peace. Netanyahu’s statement that Israel does not want to govern Gaza and wants to hand it over to Arab forces is the right idea, but he must agree to, and support, a credible plan for Gaza’s political future: one that's both free from Hamas and built in the best interest of Palestinians. That is the only road to lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians.

In parallel, it’s critical that the humanitarian needs of Palestinians are addressed immediately. The region doesn’t just need enough aid to feed the hungry, Israel needs to flood the zone with aid so there’s no reason for anyone to fight over food or for children to die of starvation.",en,Tweet,0,20,6,56,21439,2025-08-08 21:40:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
