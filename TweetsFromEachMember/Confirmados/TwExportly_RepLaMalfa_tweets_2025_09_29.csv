'1969060051920077175',"I was proud to support the House in passing a resolution honoring the life of Charlie Kirk and condemning political violence in all its forms.

Charlie was more than a political leader. He was a fighter for his beliefs, a mentor to young conservatives, and someone who never shied away from standing up for America’s values. His voice inspired thousands to get involved, and his legacy will continue to shape the future of our country.

This resolution honors his life and leadership. We can debate, we can disagree, but we cannot allow violence to silence voices or intimidate people into staying quiet. That is not who we are as a nation.",en,Tweet,0,19,2,13,1027,2025-09-19 16:24:34,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Her killer had been arrested 14 times and was still released back onto the streets. That failure cost an innocent woman her life.

More officers on buses and trains can help, but the real issue is that offenders aren’t being prosecuted and held accountable. When people are arrested over and over yet face no consequences, they go right back to committing crimes until tragedy strikes.

The Trump administration is right to require that federal benefits only go to those who are legally eligible. That’s not controversial. It’s common sense.

California’s push to block this change is solely about continuing to give benefits to those not in our country legally.

It also requires the Forest Service and BLM to ramp up timber harvests each year through 2034, putting more wood on the market while improving forest health and returning money to the Treasury.

It even claws back unspent dollars sitting idle in federal agency accounts so that money can actually go to work.

'1943732022502957277',"The budget reconciliation package takes a major step toward securing our border. It puts over $46 billion toward expanding and finishing the border wall — with 701 miles of new primary barriers, 900 miles of river barriers, plus upgrades and replacements where needed.

It invests more than $6 billion in new technology to help stop fentanyl and other threats before they reach our streets, and adds hundreds of millions to the CBP fleet so agents can actually patrol the border effectively.

It also hires thousands of new Border Patrol agents and CBP officers to enforce the law and keep this country safe.

'1943690058931810815',"Medicaid (called Medi-Cal here in California) is supposed to be a safety net for children, people with disabilities, and low-income families. The new budget reconciliation law strengthens that system by making sure it’s focused on those who truly rely on it.

Here’s what’s changing. Able-bodied adults without young kids who choose not to work will now be expected to work, volunteer, or pursue education at least 80 hours a month to keep getting benefits. It’s a commonsense, bipartisan idea that promotes stability and leads to better health outcomes.

At the same time, the law tightens eligibility checks and steps up verification of citizenship and immigration status to help crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse. Over the last decade, improper Medicaid payments have totaled more than half a trillion dollars nationwide, with $56 billion just last year. That’s unacceptable.

For states like California that have pushed Medicaid far beyond its original scope, the law gradually scales back certain federal matching rates, meaning states will pick up a fairer share of the costs. It also closes loopholes that let states draw down extra federal money without actually improving care.

As for concerns about rural healthcare, the law provides $10 billion a year for five years, totaling $50 billion, to help keep small rural hospitals and clinics open. How that money gets distributed in California will come down to the Governor and state officials. It’s critical that Sacramento gets this right so our small towns and rural residents aren’t left behind.

'1943475330179596562',"American energy production gets a strong push forward in the budget reconciliation package. It requires the Interior Department to hold regular lease sales for oil and gas — both onshore across the West and offshore in the Gulf and Alaska — opening up millions of acres that have been tied up for too long.

It lowers royalty rates, extends drilling permits, repeals the methane fee, and streamlines environmental reviews so projects don’t get stuck in endless bureaucratic delays. It also rolls back some of the costly renewable carve-outs from the Biden misnamed “Inflation Reduction Act” while still keeping incentives for other clean energy technologies.

The package directs BLM to open up more coal reserves and makes targeted investments in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and energy infrastructure to keep power reliable and affordable.

'1943430037127979344',"The budget reconciliation package updates the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by returning to mandatory work requirements and tighter accountability designed to strengthen the program and ensure it serves those who need it most.

Work requirements now cover more adults, including parents with children 14 or older. These changes push for greater participation in work, volunteering, or education programs. Waivers from these rules will be limited to areas with high unemployment, making sure states like California can't exempt the entire state from the work requirement.

Benefit increases going forward will be capped to track inflation, preventing unchecked growth without Congressional approval.

For the first time, states will be responsible for a portion of actual SNAP food benefit costs, not just administrative expenses, encouraging stronger financial stewardship at the state level. The formula for state matching funds will be updated to reflect recent payment error rates, promoting better oversight and reducing waste. When states don't have skin in the game to ensure payment accuracy, the high error rates hurt SNAP recipients the most.

These changes are about making SNAP more accountable, sustainable, and focused on helping Americans get back to work.

It makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent — avoiding an average $1,700 tax hike — and ensures families keep more of what they earn by doubling the Child Tax Credit and standard deduction.

It cuts taxes on tips and overtime pay, offers new savings tools, expands deductions for seniors, and wipes out the tax on interest for new American-made car loans. It also renews the SALT deduction, provides permanent relief from the death tax for family farms and small businesses, and doubles the expensing limit so local businesses can invest and grow.

There’s support here for farmers through lower borrowing costs, continued Opportunity Zones to draw investment into rural areas, and permanent tax breaks that encourage more production and keep jobs here at home.

This package delivers a lot of what we’ve been pushing for years. It means more jobs and a stronger economy, with tax relief that lets working families and seniors keep more of what they earn. It makes Social Security checks tax-free for most seniors, protects Medicare, and makes sure tips and overtime pay aren’t taxed. The median family in our district will save around $3,500 under this bill.

It also invests $1 billion to fix canals and expand water storage, so we can actually hold onto water during wet years instead of watching it wash out to sea. It opens up more of our country for energy and timber production and strengthens crop insurance. There’s also a new $50 billion fund to keep rural hospitals afloat as states change Medicaid formulas, so people don’t lose care close to home.

It puts real resources into securing the border so we can finally finish the wall, hire more Border Patrol and ICE agents, remove criminal illegal aliens, and get this crisis under control. It also gets us back to the principle that if you’re a healthy, able-bodied adult, you should be working.

The National Guard has been deployed, not at the request of California officials, but by direct order from President Trump. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles officials refused to act, letting the situation spiral before criticizing the effort to restore order.

This is what happens when politicians prioritize making headlines over doing their jobs. Earlier this year Gavin and many Democrats were telling people to resist and fight back against ICE arresting illegal alien criminals.

The rioters need to be arrested immediately to stop the threat. And the elected officials who are inciting and aiding them need to be dealt with sternly.

I stand with our National Guard, DHS, and every law enforcement officer on site working to protect people and property while California’s leaders cower behind press conferences and attempt to shift blame.

This relentless tax is already squeezing families and small businesses, and new clean air rules expected to take effect alongside the tax hike could push prices even higher. When State Republicans tried to stop these costly regulations, Democrats blocked the effort without debate — showing little concern for how hard Californians are being hit.

Sparking calls for her resignation from Democrats and Republicans alike, who argue that CARB wields too much unchecked power without accountability. CARB is currently proposing a new fuel standard that will further increase the cost of fuel another 65 cents a gallon.

It includes a three-year reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools program, which is critical for counties in Northern California where the federal government controls so much land that there’s no local tax base to fund essential services. SRS has kept schools open and sheriff’s departments running while Washington drags its feet on restoring the timber industry. This extension is a much-needed lifeline.

It also takes long-overdue steps to root out fraud and waste in the SNAP program by reining in the bureaucratic abuse that’s allowed states like California to hand out benefits to able-bodied adults with no work requirements and who don’t meet the federal requirements, all while taxpayers foot the bill.

The bill has improvements to agriculture programs as well, including making crop insurance work better. A working crop insurance program that protects farmers also reduces the need for supplemental disaster costs—protecting farmers and taxpayers at the same time.

'1897429656455774448',"Today, I introduced H.R. 1849, the Disaster Mitigation and Tax Parity Act, along with @RepThompson, @RepGregMurphy, and @RepJimmyPanetta, to ensure homeowners aren’t hit with federal taxes on state and local rebates for disaster preparedness efforts.

Homeowners shouldn’t be hit with unexpected federal taxes just because they received rebates through state and local programs. Right now, there’s an unfair gap between how federal and state disaster assistance is treated, leaving many homeowners with an added tax burden at the worst possible time. We need to be sure that disaster mitigation efforts actually reduce risks and help people rebuild, rather than having their assistance siphoned away by federal taxes.

California and North Carolina, amongst other states, offer rebates to homeowners who take steps to protect their homes from natural disasters, such as clearing fire-prone vegetation near structures to reduce wildfire risk, reinforcing foundations against earthquakes, and installing impact-resistant roofing. However, if these rebates come from state or local sources, homeowners are required to pay federal taxes on them. Meanwhile, rebates for energy conservation improvements are already exempt from federal income taxes. This bill would ensure that natural disaster mitigation efforts receive the same tax treatment.",en,Tweet,1,26,6,35,1011,2025-03-05 23:30:57,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Fentanyl is the leading cause of death for Americans 18 to 45, and the cartels are flooding our streets with it, often disguised as prescription pills. After years of Biden's open border policies, these drugs are pouring in from Mexico, using raw materials from China. The crisis is only worsening, and letting the Schedule I classification expire would be reckless.

This bill is about saving lives and holding traffickers accountable.

But let’s be real—how long have they had a supermajority and done nothing about it? High housing prices, sky-high utility bills, and unaffordable living have been the reality for too long, and now they act like they’ve just noticed.

These aren’t new problems. They’re the direct result of policies pushed by Sacramento politicians who seem more interested in their political agendas than actually fixing what’s broken. If they’re serious about helping families, they need to rethink the very policies that’ve made California unaffordable in the first place.
