'1843294272755224939',"Today is an incredibly difficult and sad day, as we all remember the twelve hundred innocent people who were murdered in the October 7 attack. These were children and the elderly, brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers. They were young people with bright futures and people dedicated to building a lasting peace in the region. My heart and prayers are with their families on this terrible day.

We must also recommit ourselves to bringing home the one hundred hostages, including a number of Americans, still being held by Hamas. I promise that I will not stop working to bring them home safely to their families.",en,Tweet,2,118,21,46,17575,2024-10-07 15:16:16,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
