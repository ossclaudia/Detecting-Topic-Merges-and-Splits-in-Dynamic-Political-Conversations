Depending on the state, an independent commission, its legislature or a combination of the two oversees the process to ensure balanced representation for its citizens. 

Gerrymandering is not required nor is it neutral. It's designed to manipulate district boundaries to disadvantage a political party or group.

None of these actions make us safer or more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump Administration delivered this week:

President Trump put American lives at risk by bombing Iran, a country we are not at war with, without the approval of Congress. Now he’s trying to limit Congress’ ability to conduct oversight by limiting our access to classified information.

The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump Administration is allowed to continue deporting migrants to countries that are NOT they aren’t from, to be incarcerated indefinitely and funded with American taxpayer dollars. The statement from the Department of Homeland Security: “Fire up the deportation planes.”

President Trump and his Administration plans to withhold or cancel billions of dollars of Congressionally approved spending that is required to be spent by the end of this Fiscal Year, and Republicans in Congress have proposed cutting funding the Government Accountability Office – the agency tasked with overseeing and investigating federal budget law violations.

President Trump is continuing to compile a “master-list” of personal information on millions of U.S. residents including the Social Security numbers, addresses, and dates of birth of anyone who applied for SNAP in the last five years and millions of Medicaid recipients.

Senior White House Advisor Kari Lake is gutting the U.S. Agency for Global Media, a nonpartisan federal agency which helps to provide objective news and cultural programs to people living under oppressive regimes across the world.

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump Administration delivered this week:

President Trump has once again proven that his loyalties are to the rich and well connected. This week, he pardoned over a dozen former elected officials, reality TV personalities, mega donors and a gang leader. Some of the cleared charges include corruption, tax evasion, insider trading, bribery, and federal firearm offenses.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues to undermine the health care and medical research across this country, unilaterally deciding this week that healthy children and healthy pregnant people should not get the covid vaccine. He also announced that medical journals are corrupt and scientists should no longer publish their research in them. Secretary Kennedy also continues to spread misinformation in service of President Trump’s agenda by misrepresenting scientific data and citing medical studies that do not exist.

President Trump and his allies are to trying to manipulate the information being shared with the American people. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard asked analysts at her agency to revise a report that was at odds with President Trump’s immigration policy, and the White House fired members a nonpartisan organization that publishes a record of U.S. foreign policy.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is in hot water again after it was reported that he used illegal and unconstitutional wiretaps as part of his investigation into information leaks coming from the Pentagon.

The Trump Administration will no longer allow federal employees to use paid time off in order to vote.

President Trump has now officially accepted a $400 million plane from the royal family of Qatar with zero oversight from Congress because Speaker Mike Johnson refuses to go against the President.

Under orders from the Trump Administration, the CDC has stopped almost all of its communications, including about disease outbreaks and health alerts. Cases of measles, salmonella, listeria, and hepatitis A and C are spreading throughout the country, but the American people are being left in the dark without knowledge of where these outbreaks are happening and how to stay safe.

The Trump Administration is deporting migrants to countries they have no connection to, this week sending migrants from Vietnam and Myanmar to South Sudan. This blatantly violates a court order that stops the deportation of migrants to third countries without due process.

Next week, the Trump Administration is launching their “Gold Card” website for people to buy U.S. citizenship for $5 million, once again proving that the Administration’s loyalties are with the ultra-rich.

In a continuation of his vendetta against higher education, the Trump Administration has revoked Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. This means the university can no longer enroll international students, and any current international students will need to transfer to a different institution to maintain their legal status.

President Trump has once again interfered in the business of Congress, tipping the scale to pass his “Big Beautiful Bill” which will be disastrous for the American people.

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration delivered last week:

During a House budget hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said ""I don't think people should be taking advice--medical advice--from me.""

President Trump worked hard trying to convince us that not accepting a $400 million plane from Qatar that he wants to use as Air Force One and then transfer to his eventual library would be dumb. Congress has to approve gifts to all Presidents but Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said this was ""not in my lane.""

After summarily firing the Librarian of Congress and then the head of the U.S. Copyright Office, the Trump administration is attempting a hostile takeover of the Library of Congress, a part of the legislative branch. Unknown to most people outside of the Washington bubble is the fact that the Library's sub-agencies are the ones that give confidential legal advice to members of Congress while also overseeing and preserving all copyrighted material in the nation. Trump and Elon Musk want access to that information and data.

We learned that the architect of Project 2025, Russell Vought, will be taking over DOGE when Musk's tenure as a special government employee expires. Vought is the same person who believes the nation is experiencing a ""Marxist takeover"" and promised to put career civil servants ""in trauma.""

American intelligence officials released a report confirming that the Venezuelan government is not controlling the Tren de Aragua gang's operations in the United States. President Trump's assertion the gang works in concert with the Venezuelan government and has invaded our nation is how he rationalized invoking the Alien Enemies Act. And the authors of the report were quickly fired by DNI Gabbard.

Falsely claiming a genocide against white South African farmers, President Trump granted refugee status to and flew a group of Afrikaners to the US on a State Department-chartered plane with plans to resettle them here using federal resources. The president suspended humanitarian admissions of all other refugees immediately after taking office in January.

Homeland Secretary head Kristi Noem announced the end of temporary protected status for Afghan refugees in the U.S., many of whom worked with us and saved the lives of American troops in Afghanistan. Our forcing them to return to a nation where they are considered enemies of the state undermines, to say the least, our military's ability to work collaboratively with locals in future conflicts.

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration delivered this week:

President Trump threatened to end the program designed to expand high-speed internet access in communities it hasn't yet reached, calling it ""woke handouts based on race,"" despite funding already distributed to red, rural states including Alabama, Iowa, Kansas and Indiana.

One day after testifying in front of Congress to explain why FEMA should not be disbanded, acting administrator Cameron Hilton was summarily fired.

President Trump fired the Librarian of Congress. Carla Hayden was only the 14th person to serve the nation in this apolitical role, and she was also the first woman and first non-white person to do so.

A concept of a trade deal with the United Kingdom, with whom we enjoy a trade surplus, was announced yesterday that will lower the price of Rolls Royce, Bentley, Jaguar, Aston Martin, Range Rover and Mini automobiles. There were no carveouts for any other consumer goods.

The Trump administration is putting pressure on countries facing US tariffs to approve the use of Starlink in their territory, a satellite company owned by special government employee Elon Musk.

President Trump appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro to serve as interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia after being forced to withdraw the nomination of his first choice because the ""Stop the Steal"" activist and J6 defender could not muster the support of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

President Trump pulled down another nominee, this time for Surgeon General, because his first choice came under scrutiny for inflating her credentials. Yesterday he nominated a wellness influencer and author instead.

A vote to make sure the Gulf of Mexico appears as the Gulf of America on US government maps and documents was one of only six bills Speaker Johnson brought to the floor.

Most of the buyers of President Trump's meme coin, who are currently in a competition to win a dinner and/or a special tour with him, have used foreign exchanges that ban US buyers, making it likely that foreigner customers are not only directly enriching the president but also buying access to him.

Pete Hegseth was found to have conducted even more official Pentagon business over the unsecured Signal platform, and yet he is still the Secretary of Defense.

We know this because of the pandemic and its consequences. We know this from assassination attempts. It's exactly why Congress came together and allocated a billion dollars to help our kids' mental health. 

Now @realDonaldTrump @elonmusk  and DOGE think they know better. They are claiming that bipartisan programs designed and Congressionally funded to help youth mental health and stem gun violence in schools aren't in ""the best interest of the federal government."" What? Since when is stopping school shootings and treating youth mental health NOT in the best interests of Americans?

And why aren't my Republican colleagues raging against this latest unconstitutional, illegal action by POTUS? Why aren't they defending our kids when their mental health is being defunded? Call your elected officials to tell them our kids matter. Their mental health matters. The silence of the Republicans is deafening.

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration delivered this week:

President Trump is openly defying the United States Supreme Court, refusing to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States while also threatening to send US citizens to foreign prisons.

President Trump launched Truth Social investment accounts made up of stocks in companies directly benefiting from his tariff and trade policies.

After not updating its tracking website for nearly a month, DOGE removed hundreds of ""cuts"" they had taken credit for and edited others to try to juice the savings they are claiming.

Sensitive national security information continues to flow out of the Secretary of Defense's office, and multiple political appointees and staffers were escorted out of the Pentagon or placed on administrative leave. Meanwhile, their boss--a chief Signalgate leaker himself--remains uninvestigated and clearly incapable of protecting national secrets.

Trump's choice to lead the IRS had a great week--the nominee had $130K in personal debt paid off by donors who happen to work in tax consulting businesses or are involved in tax-related legal fights.

The Pentagon continued its erasure campaign, this time removing information from its websites about the Air Force's first female Thunderbird pilot and her accomplishments.

The NIH is following suit, as we learned that 38 of the 43 scientists cut from the boards tasked with reviewing science and research happening in NIH laboratories were female, Black or Hispanic.

The federal office responsible for battling foreign disinformation is being eliminated.

E.coli is back! Fifteen states were hit with a deadly outbreak linked to lettuce but the FDA chose not to share this with the American public. Also this week we learned the FDA plans to stop routine food safety inspections.

'1910736830267338878',"Law(less) + (Dis)Order(ly) Episode 9: Special Guest Stars, House Republicans

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration and this week's guest stars, the @HouseGOP, delivered this week:

@therealdonaldtrump again downgraded America, pausing his chaotic tariff scheme only after crashing stock and bond markets, wiping out Americans' savings and further isolating our nation from our former allies while ratcheting up China tariffs and inviting retaliation.

@elonmusk again downgraded the savings DOGE is supposedly finding, going from his promise of $ 1T in waste, fraud and abuse savings to $150B, as he said in yesterday's Cabinet meeting. I'm thrilled to save Americans $150B but can't trust the word of Musk and DOGE.

The President has invoked a wartimes power act to label people ""enemies"" and ship them out of the country without due process guaranteed by the Constitution.

House Republicans passed a budget resolution that will cut almost $1 trillion in healthcare, adds trillions of dollars to the national debt and gives trillions of tax giveaways to the ultra rich. Trillions.

As part of that bill, the House Republicans passed a rule turning a 24-hour day inside out. The rule reads, in part, ""...each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through September 30, 2025, shall not constitute a calendar day."" Huh?

House Republicans snuck language into a larger bill to ensure they can prevent any attempt by Congress to revoke the emergency powers Trump is currently using to enact these economy-killing tariffs.

House Republicans passed the SAVE Act to suppress the votes of active duty servicemembers, married women and rural voters across the country.

House Republicans passed a bill attacking federal judges for--wait for it--following the law. (Read that again. It's a real thing.)

House Republicans passed a bill to increase overdraft fees. They used to be capped at five bucks. Thanks to Republicans, that's not the case anymore. You get hit with a much higher fee, banks make more money.

The President is using the Justice Department to go after former government officials who didn't break any laws but irritated him by following the law in his first term.

The President is trying to kill the ""notice and comment"" rules that allow for public input on government rules, in a bid to erase regulations unilaterally.

Another high-ranking female military commander was relived of duty, this time Colonel Susan Meyers of the US Space Force, stationed in Greenland.

The White House invited a ""reporter"" from Zero Hedge--a website accused of spreading Russian propaganda-- into the press pool while continuing to block the AP despite federal court ruling requiring them to be reinstated.

@FBIDirectorKash  got demoted to running only the FBI because he didn't show up for work at his ATF job.

The IRS invited DOGE into its operations and databases. DOGE is hosting an IRS ""hackathon"" next week. What could possibly go wrong?

There have been zero investigations opened into @SecDef @DNIGabbard @MikeWaltz47 and other Admin executives sharing secret and/or classified information on Signal.

The price of eggs has skyrocketed. Again.

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration delivered this week:

Speaker Johnson allowed the House to vote on...wait for it...refrigerators. Meanwhile...

The Administration abruptly cancelled $500 million in deliveries to food banks across the country.

@realDonaldTrump signed an Executive Order to end collective bargaining for federal unions, including those at the Department of State, Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Health and Human Services, Treasury, Justice, Commerce and parts of Homeland Security.

@SecDef , @MikeWaltz47 , @DNIGabbard and other high-ranking military, intelligence and Exec Branch officials shared classified information over unsecure messaging platform Signal (after a Pentagon warning to staff not to use it!), inadvertently invited an @TheAtlantic journalist into the chat and then lied about it all, over and over and over again.

President Trump is moving to kneecap states and reshape elections at every level of government to make registering to vote and voting itself more difficult.

President Trump announced he wants to create a ""compensation fund"" for the January 6 criminals he has inexplicably pardoned.

President Trump is erasing our national heritage by demanding the whitewashing of historic information across all 21 of the Smithsonian museums and its 14 education and research centers, as well as Arlington National Cemetery, and is tasking Vice President Vance with the coverup.

President Trump abruptly cancelled $12B in federal grants for states that were using the funds to track infectious diseases, provide mental health services and addiction treatment, and fund the response to the growing measles epidemic, among other initiatives.

Acting-President @elonmusk is dropping millions of dollars into a Wisconsin Supreme Court race to buy another official--this time a judge he expects will be favorable to his pending lawsuit against the state.

@SpeakerJohnson floated the idea of simply getting rid of federal courts or taking away their funding because he and the Administration don't like judges actually upholding the laws of the land.

Four American soldiers died in Lithuania--a Pennsylvania National Guard partner nation--and Trump didn't know anything about it.

These countries issued travel advisories warning their citizens against visiting the United States: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom.

And once again, the Trump Administration is trying to kill @elmo.

EPA director Lee Zeldin eliminated all EPA environmental justice offices, which exist to reduce pollution in poor rural and urban communities.

The Family Trump is in talks with Binance to buy a stake in the crypto exchange that pleaded guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money-laundering requirements.

-Aligning us with our adversaries and voting against our ally on the UN resolution condemning Russia for invading Ukraine
-Passing an initial budget framework in the House that would add $5 TRILLION to our national debt over just ten years and gut programs like Medicare and Medicaid so President Trump can extend tax cuts to the rich
-Firing ~6,000 American veterans who protected us as members of our all-volunteer armed forces and then served us again in federal jobs in the VA, Justice, Transportation, Social Security, Labor, and State departments, to name just a few
-Closing Social Security offices, laying off employees who manage its website and customer support, and closing its Offices of Transformation and Civil Rights, all to make it harder to apply for, manage, and receive the benefits that you have paid for in every paycheck
-Firing hundreds of scientists and experts from critical posts in the National Weather Service and NOAA just before the annual Atlantic storm season
-Preparing to cancel the FAA's contract with Verizon to award it to one of Elon Musk's companies, adding another $2B to the more than $3.3 BILLION Musk's SpaceX and Starlink have received from the federal government in just the past 12 months
-Announcing from the Oval Office the sale of $5 million ""Trump gold cards"" to provide rich people permanent U.S. residency and a pathway to citizenship
-Dismissing cases against companies accused of cheating millions of American consumers, including student loan and home mortgage companies that engaged in illegal kickbacks, loan churning, and illegal debt collections.

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are just a few things the new administration delivered this week:

-Elon Musk and his posse of hackers have gained access to the private information of millions of Americans without their knowledge or consent. No one fully knows what he has access to or how he intends to use it. 
-The President claimed future ownership of Gaza with the intent of removing Palestinians and developing the ""Riviera of the Mideast."" This is in direct violation of international laws and treaties, which the United States is a part of. 
-Election denier Pam Bondi was confirmed as Attorney General, the nation's top law enforcement officer, who then promptly ended the task force focused on foreign election interference. 
-Known Russian sympathizer Tulsi Gabbard was confirmed as Director of National Intelligence and is now in charge of 18 agencies, a $76B annual budget, and every single one of our national secrets. 
-The primary author of Project 2025, a zealous proponent of presidential overreach, was installed as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
-USAID was eviscerated, eliminating our nation’s ability to influence nations (or just plain do the right thing) with anything other than military power and bringing an end to its investigation into Musk's Starlink. 
-Even more J6 insurrectionists who got blanket pardons from POTUS a couple of weeks ago have been arrested on charges including possession of firearms, resisting arrest, online solicitation of a minor, child pornography, and vehicular homicide.
