Worth the read - some key highlights below:

➡️ “The GOP bill also includes sensible measures such as asking states to check their Medicaid expansion rolls every six months…That is necessary because the Biden Administration waived millions onto health entitlements. The Paragon Institute estimates that 6.4 million people are enrolled in fully subsidized ObamaCare plans but don’t meet the eligibility criteria. Apparently this is what Democrats support.”

➡️ “More of those who rely on benefits for longer need to be working. The GOP bill would expand the current work requirement to cover more able-bodied adults…”

➡️“The law also tries to tighten up waivers that states have abused to eliminate the work rules. The other major change is asking states with high improper payment rates to have skin in the game and pick up a share of benefit costs [for SNAP], which are currently billed 100% to the federal taxpayer.”

Christmas is a wonderful time to slow down and spend time with friends and family. This holiday season, I am blessed to spend time with my wonderful family – my husband Matt, and our two boys, Max and Jax.

Amid all the festivities, we must also take the time to reflect on the true meaning of Christmas – the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. As a mom, I am so grateful for the opportunity to share my faith with my boys and see the magic of Christmas through their eyes (even though they may be too old to believe in Santa now!)

Luke 2:10-11: ""And the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid; I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For this very day in David's town your Saviour was born — Christ the Lord!""

As we gather with loved ones this holiday season, we must not forget our servicemembers as well as our first responders and law enforcement who are sacrificing time with their families so we can safely enjoy time with ours. To those who are serving our nation abroad and our communities this Christmas: Thank you! I am keeping you and your families in my thoughts and prayers this holiday season.
