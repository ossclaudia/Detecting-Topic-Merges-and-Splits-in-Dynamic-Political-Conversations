'1970507711222616556',"Unpopular Dems are under pressure from their radical left base to pick a fight w/ @POTUS. ⬇️ 

Here's where we stand:  

1) 96% of @SenateDems supported 13 short-term bills to keep the government open under Biden.  

2) Now, Chuck Schumer is holding Americans hostage *unless* we meet the left's insane demands.  

They want $1 TRILLION for policies America *already* rejected, like taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal aliens, and half a billion for NPR. Not a chance.

Dems are throwing temper tantrums for show. They know ANY funding bill takes 60 votes--@SenateGOP has 53 Senate seats. So, the ball is in Schumer's court.   

Keep the government running, or 100% own a Schumer Shutdown™️.

Yeah, right.

1) @ChuckSchumer said in 2022: ""both sides have long agreed that a President deserves to have his or her Administration in place, quickly.""

2) @SenateGOP dropped a resolution to confirm a batch of 48 nominees ""en bloc"" who received *bipartisan* support at the committee level.

How many Dems will support it? 

It's Trump Derangement Syndrome.

That's why we're changing the Senate rules to fix this process. The left will scream, ""Dictatorship!"" Again, no. Rule changes have been done before, in fact, Senate Dems started it in 2013.

We advanced the batch of 48 noms last night. Next step is a cloture vote (60-vote threshold), then assuming that fails, a simple majority vote (51-vote margin) to change the rules to move MORE nominees QUICKLY and in GROUPS. We have 53 GOP seats.

At 10:45pm last night, we finished: confirming Gaisser and Kent, and invoked cloture on Clarkson and two more nominees (at Homeland & US Marshals). 

This morning, we'll advance Cheryl Mason for Inspector General at the VA, then confirm Tyler Clarkson for GC at @USDA. 

Later today: we plan to confirm Gadyaces Serralta to be Director of the US Marshals Service and Matthew Kozma to be Under Sec. at Homeland. 

Leader Thune has filed cloture on more nominees in the pipeline. 

FACT: We've confirmed twice as many Trump nominees today compared to this same point in 2017. BUT every nominee takes about 3.5 hours on procedure without a time agreement with the other side. (Senate rules. Don’t get me started.)

Why does it take so long? In short: Dem obstruction. Not ONE nominee has moved by a voice vote or unanimous consent--that's never happened before. We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. Dems have chosen to do this the hard way.

'1948041360348455278',"You've heard me say: there are three tools to *start* getting our fiscal house in order—with the ultimate goal of balancing the budget while President Trump is in office.
 
1) Reconciliation. We did that with 'One Big, Beautiful Bill.' 2) Rescissions. We've passed $9 billion DOGE cuts so far. 3) Appropriations (annual government funding).
 
Quick history: last year, when Senate Democrat ""leader"" Chuck Schumer was in charge (dark times) the Senate had 11 of 12 appropriations bills ready to go. 

In 2024, Schumer did not bring ONE appropriations bill to the floor for a vote.
 
That failure set up a continuing resolution (CR) vote to essentially punt the football and move the deadline since Congress failed to do its job. 

While nobody ever wins in a government shutdown, a CR is bad governance.
 
Call me crazy, I believe Congress should do our jobs on time and bring appropriations bills to the floor to fund the government through regular order. 

Now, what happens next will be interesting…
 
Any regular-order consideration of appropriations bills requires cooperation, because of the 60-vote threshold. We have 53 Senate Republicans. 

However, the Senate liberals are SO mad we cut some spending through rescissions (a $9 billion drop in the bucket) that they've indicated they could use that as an excuse to shut down the government.

Note: this rescissions package only requires a simple majority vote (aka 51 of our 53 @SenateGOP seats). 

Among other cuts, this rescissions package targets billions in wasteful foreign aid spending. It’s a good step, we have a lot more to do.

'1930617032631804072',"Most Americans get the mission behind President Trump's historic 'One Big, Beautiful Bill.' But, there's been some back and forth.

Here's what you need to know ⬇️

FACT: President Trump's 'One Big, Beautiful Bill' was designed by the President himself, his team, and his closest MAGA allies in Congress to deliver the MAGA agenda. 

This is the President's vision.

No bill is perfect, but we have a once-in-a-lifetime bill to deliver EXACTLY what @POTUS promised: lower taxes, a secure border, strong military, and reining in spending. And with only 51 votes!

It's simple: President Trump won HUGE in November. He helped us deliver a House and Senate GOP majority. It's our job to help him deliver the MAGA agenda.

As we speak, many of us are still working with the White House on improving this bill in the Senate. 

Keep in mind: this reconciliation process can ONLY be used for non-discretionary (aka mandatory) spending. Stick with me. All that means is because President Trump's MAGA bill only requires 51 votes vs 60, there are strict limits on what can be included.

The appropriations process is how we can aggressively cut more discretionary spending (already in the works). Plus, we've got the rescissions process (@WhiteHouse sends Congress a package of funding to cut) to make @DOGE cuts permanent.

It's a lot of government lingo, but we'll do our best to keep breaking it down. Bottom line: trust President Trump.

One MAJOR way: We're working with the Trump @WhiteHouse on an upcoming @DOGE cuts package to CANCEL wasteful spending using something called the rescissions process.

Here's how it works:

Under the Impoundment Control Act, we've asked the Trump administration to send Congress a package of previously appropriated federal funds for us to eliminate. 

Note: this rescissions package only requires a simple majority vote (aka 51 of our 53 @SenateGOP seats). 

Among other cuts, the upcoming rescissions package targets billions in wasteful foreign aid spending.

Now, once the Trump administration sends this rescissions package over, by law, Congress has 45 DAYS to review the funding and strike it down.

'1927355669205651922',"🚨 UPDATE: President Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill.'

We've gotten a ton of questions on what's NEXT. Here's a breakdown:

This week, @SenateGOP will begin to ""scrub"" the 1,000+ page bill to comply with something called the Byrd rule. 

I’ve called it the “Byrd Bath.” 

In short: because reconciliation (this bill) is a fast-track process that only requires 51 Senate votes versus 60, there are strict rules for compliance. The bill must directly impact federal spending or taxes.

For example, liberals previously tried to use their own reconciliation process to give mass amnesty to illegal aliens, but they FAILED (aka, it didn't pass the Byrd rule) because it would've been a huge policy change that outweighed budget impact.

Note: The House is NOT bound by the Byrd rule—only we are. I've used this example: the House has to fit through a garage door, the Senate has to squeeze through a window in the garage door.

Part of that promise was to have the most successful entrepreneur *in the world* tackle government waste, fraud, & abuse. This isn't a surprise! Trump made this promise on the trail *with* Elon, and @POTUS went on to dominate the 2024 election. 

I remind the Dems: Trump won every swing state, the popular vote, and he helped deliver a @SenateGOP and @HouseGOP majority. A clean sweep.

I've been in business for 25+ years. Successful companies across the world bring in consultants. Trump knows this. He wrote the Art of the Deal. Now, we have the BEST consultant offering to give us suggestions to save taxpayer dollars. 

What are liberals doing in response? Defending USAID's funding of DEI musicals in Ireland, LGBT activism and sex changes in Guatemala, and transgender comic books in Peru. Either you agree with this use of taxpayer dollars, or you don't. If you think it's a waste: you can thank President Trump and the team he's assembled!

It's simple: @POTUS believes taxpayer money must be spent to advance U.S. interests. He has EVERY right to pause and evaluate expenditures.",en,Tweet,120,8981,2063,472,96515,2025-02-07 14:21:06,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Americans aren't buying it. ⬇️

First, as @VP, she is responsible for her administration's record. That means 40-year high inflation, 10.2M illegal migrants (that we know about), crime & safety, etc.

Beyond that, Kamala Harris has cast some of the most significant tie-breaking economic votes in history. She is the reason we're stuck with the Inflation Expansion Act. 

Biden tapped her to lead on immigration. We know how that turned out. Harris said she was proud to be ""last in the room"" during the deadly Afghanistan disaster, and still claims to be part of most key policy decisions.

You cannot have it both ways. If Kamala Harris is a significant policy player (as she claims to be) why after 3.5 years has she done nothing to fix inflation and the open border?
