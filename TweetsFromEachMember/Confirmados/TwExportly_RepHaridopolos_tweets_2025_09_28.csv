'1909667245967499498',"I want to take a moment to refute some of the outright lies being spread about what’s going on at the VA. 

Let’s be clear: What is happening now is not about cutting care. It is about reforming a bloated bureaucracy that has protected underperforming employees for years, often at the expense of veterans. The VA has been on the Government Accountability Office’s high-risk list since 2015. That means for nearly a decade, independent watchdogs have flagged serious, systemic failures in patient safety, access to care, staffing, and infrastructure. 

Despite the propaganda of the usual people who just parrot what they are told, the number of job reductions is not 84,000. To date, only 2,400 jobs have been cut, 0.005% of the total VA headcount, and all were probationary employees in non-critical positions such as PR, interior design, and DEI. 

The VA is going through a process to find ways to improve care and benefits for veterans. All mission-critical providers such as doctors, nurses, or claims processors are EXEMPT from cuts. To add to that, supervisors have the opportunity to request that their employees be exempted from hiring freezes and probationary removal.

The last four years have shown that higher headcounts do not equate with better outcomes. Under the Biden administration, 52,000 additional employees were brought into the VA, bringing the total staff headcount to 470,000. Yet the average wait times for various services increased as the agency grew. 

From 2021 to 2024:
- Wait times for primary care grew from 15 days to 24 days — a 60% increase
- Wait times for mental health care grew from 14 days to 20 days — a 42% increase
- Wait times for specialty care grew from 24 days to 38 days — a 58% increase
- Additionally, the disability claims backlog increased.

More money and more people did not translate to better care for our veterans. It just made the system bigger, slower, and harder to navigate. 

Veterans are not asking for a larger VA bureaucracy. They are asking for a VA that actually works. As your Congressman, I’m committed to delivering for our veterans and ensuring that they receive the care they deserve. That means modernizing outdated systems, reducing inefficiency, and focusing on achieving results instead of growing headcounts.",en,Tweet,0,10,1,2,413,2025-04-08 18:58:45,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
