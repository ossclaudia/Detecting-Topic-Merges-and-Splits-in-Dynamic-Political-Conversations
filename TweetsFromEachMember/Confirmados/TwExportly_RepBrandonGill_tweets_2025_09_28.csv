'1895929848884756522',"Illegal border crossings are now lower than they’ve EVER been recorded. 

After only a few weeks in office, President Trump ended America’s existential border crisis.

For my entire life, the American people have begged Washington to secure our border. And Presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Obama and Biden completely ignored them. They would campaign on securing the border, lie to the American people, and ultimately do nothing.

The lure of millions of new voters or hoards of cheap serf laborers was too appealing to pass up.

But not for Trump.

In February, Border Patrol recorded 8,326 unlawful illegal alien entries.

For reference, when Biden was in office, we’d have more alien crossings in a single day than that.

8,326 is the lowest number of monthly unlawful entries since Border Patrol began reporting monthly data in 2000.

And while Biden released thousands of unvetted aliens into our heartland every day, the aliens caught under President Trump were detained and deported.

President Trump didn’t make excuses. He didn’t focus on “root causes” or external factors out of our control. He simply chose to enforce America’s border policies already on the books: capture, detain, deport.

He did his job.

The United States cannot run its foreign policy based on idealistic platitudes with no connection to the reality on the ground. Both the American people and the international community should be thankful that @realDonaldTrump and @JDVance recognize this. 

On its own, Ukraine cannot win this war. It’s outmanned and outgunned by a nation far larger, more wealthy and more powerful than it is.

There are only limited options to proceed. 1) Ukraine can surrender, almost certainly on terms it and the global community find unappealing. 2) The US can prolong the war, costing potentially trillions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives, and risking a larger global conflagration with one of the world’s biggest nuclear superpowers. 3) The US could broker a negotiated peace on acceptable terms, all from a position of strength and global leadership. 

Those are the options, regardless of who started the war or who is a “war criminal.”

By supporting a negotiated pathway to peace, @realdonaldtrump and @JDVance are making the most out of a bad situation. They’re saving lives, saving resources and making the world safer.

And they’re strengthening America’s role as leader of the free world. Both the American people and the international community should be thankful.

President Trump’s Remain in Mexico policy was extremely successful, resulting in fewer illegal border crossings, fewer fraudulent asylum claims, and more deportations.

But immediately after taking power in 2021, Democrats undid nearly all of President Trump’s border protection policies, unleashing mass chaos and destruction throughout our heartland.

'1876658090914779320',"Laken Riley was a 22-year-old young woman, daughter, and sister with her entire life ahead of her. She was a nursing student and member of the cross country team at UGA.

But last February, Laken Riley was brutally murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela. She should still be here with us today, but she’s not, because Democrats intentionally opened our borders and virtually invited criminals from all over the world to pour into our neighborhoods.

Because of Democrats, foreign thugs are slaughtering OUR people on OUR soil.

This has to end NOW, and today we are taking a step in the right direction with the Laken Riley Act, which I am proud to co-sponsor.

The Laken Riley Act is the first bill of the 119th Congress. It’s a critical piece of legislation that mandates illegal aliens - like the one who murdered Laken - are detained and prioritized for deportation. It also empowers states to sue federal officials who refuse to enforce our immigration laws.

This bill would have saved Laken’s life and is a necessary initial step towards securing our border.
