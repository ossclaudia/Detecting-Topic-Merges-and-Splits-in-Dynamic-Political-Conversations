'1969082616340234422',"Political violence is vile, wicked, and destructive to the core of our democracy. And yet, two things can be true at once— I stand against all forms of violence by sick, evil, and demented people while at the same time rejecting Charlie Kirk’s selectively harmful and divisive rhetoric. That is why I voted against supporting House Resolution 719. 

Unfortunately, that resolution goes far beyond condemning violence—it attempts to sanitize and praise aspects of Mr. Kirk’s legacy, despite his record of distorting and lambasting the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and making highly charged, racist claims about Black people, our communities, our lifestyles, and even our intelligence.  

I will never endorse such blatantly racist attacks with my vote.

'1963057565631213878',"Earlier today, I spent 2.5 hours meeting with survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's abuse.
 
Most of the victims were exploited at 13, 14 and 15 years of age, deceived by promises of a college education, a job, or threats of harm to their family members. 
 
This is not only about the horrific actions of Epstein and Maxwell, but also about the wider network of individuals who enabled, concealed, and even profited from this exploitation.
 
Such complicity is illegal, unconscionable and must be exposed.

'1920837595539329110',"Trump's vindictive firing of Dr. Carla Hayden as the nation's Librarian of Congress shows just how petty and mean he can be without cause.

For over a decade Dr. Hayden has been the guardian of our nation’s truth and intellectual legacy, but she was too fair-minded for Trump.

He wants to ban books and tell Americans what to read – or not read, and what history should be erased.

Earth calling Donald Trump... ""If you erase it, we will replace it.""

I have met personally with the families of Israeli hostages, heard from Palestinians in my Capitol Hill Office, and have been deeply moved by all who have engaged in dialogue with me on this issue.
 
Today, a critical first step has been taken towards regional stability, and it is crucial the terms of this agreement are upheld. I applaud President Biden’s role in securing the ceasefire and hope that the incoming Trump administration follows through on this progress to ultimately usher in a lasting peace.

Steps on working class families,
 
Fails to lower prescription drug prices,

Walks away from #veterans,

Abandons our longstanding commitment to nutritional assistance programs for children,
 
Turns its back on community health centers designed to help those most in need like the elderly in our communities,
 
Disregards investments into #Medicaid for the sick,
 
Ignores opioid recovery, 
 
Walks away from the plight of pregnant and postpartum women struggling with addiction, 

Paves the way for pharmacy benefit managers to continue running amok, and, 

Benefits millionaires and billionaires.
