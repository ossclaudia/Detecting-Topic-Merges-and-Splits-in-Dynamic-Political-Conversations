'1898040075805425911',"Truth matters and here it is: This NEVER happened.

Our casework team traveled to Jefferson City to meet with both Republican and Democrat state-level counterparts to strengthen relationships and better serve our constituents. It is extremely unfortunate that an elected official feels the need to make up politically motivated lies about our team, who works tirelessly for the constituents of the Fourth District. They do not deserve this.

As a serious legislator, these types of reprehensible lies for relevancy are not only offensive to our team, but they are an embarrassing waste of time that does absolutely nothing to help the great people of Missouri.
The truth is that Rep. David Tyson Smith’s legislative assistant welcomed my team with open arms, smiles, and pleasant conversations. The meeting was full of professionalism and constructive conversations, and nobody ever discussed our public phone number (which is widely published on our website and on various Facebook posts).

After this great meeting, she even took the picture posted below. Does she look “intimidated” to you? No—because this entire claim is a flat-out lie.

Our team would also never say they did not want to help constituents with the VA. On the contrary, they have done an incredible job helping to serve our constituents and they have worked diligently to deliver real results for casework claims. In fact, our team has returned $3,152.128.69 to our constituents. This includes helping veterans secure the benefits they earned from the VA totaling $411,073.14.

Misleading voters for partisan political points is abhorrent. But this is what radical progressive politics is about – no agenda, no vision, no leadership. Just performative outrage and shameless grandstanding. Missouri deserves better than this.

One year later, the people of Israel are still living October 7th every single day. One year later, they are still forced to continue fighting to defend themselves against the many enemies trying to destroy them. One year later, Hamas continues to hold innocent people hostage.
