'1925649795290472530',"With several of my Jewish colleagues, I visited the Capital Jewish Museum to pay respects to the two young souls who were brutally, hatefully murdered last night. I thought I'd share with you what I said outside the museum, in response to this horrible, horrible murder:

Last night at this site there was a gathering sponsored by the American Jewish Committee of young professionals, diplomatic professionals, who were dedicating their careers to the idea of building bridges -- bridges between people and bridges between nations.

Jewish tradition going back to Rabbi Hillel’s famous quotation, “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am only for myself, what am I?” -- the idea that we belong together as a nation. Our motto, E Pluribus Unum, from many one. That's the ideal we all believe in and strive for every day in this city.

But there's another reality, a reality that's been true my entire life. As a young child, I remember going to synagogue on high holidays and there would be extra security, there'd be guards. In the 1970s and 80s, those guards started carrying longer guns and in the last number of years those guards have started appearing not just on the high holidays but every single day.

And in the 19 months since October 7th, 2023, we have seen a rise of antisemitism that has been unprecedented in my lifetime, so much so to the point that people are told don't wear outwards display of your faith. Wear a baseball cap instead of a yamaka. Take your Star of David and tuck it in your shirt.

There is a real fear.

So, as we gather here today, we are overwhelming… overwhelmed by emotions. Emotions of grief at the loss of two beautiful young people who were prepared to make a life together, heading to Israel to become engaged -- to make a promise to each other for a future united.

And [then they had] that future cut short last night.

Instead, their families, rather than gathering under the huppah will be gathering beside a grave saying a Kadesh instead of Seven Blessings.

We have grief. We have fear. But we're not surprised at what happened and we are not going to back down. The resolve of all of us standing here, the resolve of every American Jew, the resolve of Jews around the world is that we will hold on to who we are with pride and defiance. We know our place is in this city, in this country. For us, within the governing halls of the United States.
And we will not let anyone tell us we don't belong.

We are overwhelmed with grief for two beautiful souls, but we must be inspired by their spirit and their example. They were here last night participating in a program about reaching out. That is who they are, that is how they will be remembered.

We're here today to mark their murder, to express our sorrow but we must stand to ensure their memory is always a blessing. We cannot let their death be in vain. We must stand up against hate, against antisemitism, against efforts to divide people and instead make sure we work to unite people.",en,Tweet,2,3,0,34,10781,2025-05-22 21:27:42,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Approximately 35,000 veterans, every Navy recruit in basic training, thousands of active-duty service members serving at Naval Station Great Lakes and their families receive vital healthcare at Lovell.

Elon Musk and DOGE taking a chainsaw to our federal workforce rather than a scalpel threatens to not only add inefficiency and chaos to our government, but it also threatens to make us less healthy, less safe, and less secure. None of this should fall on the backs of those who serve our nation.

On May 13, 1862, Smalls—a 23-year-old enslaved man and skilled sailor working on the Confederate transport ship Planter—disguised himself as the ship’s captain. He and his crew navigated past Confederate checkpoints and courageously delivered the vessel—along with 16 enslaved people—to the Union Navy.

His bravery didn’t stop there. Smalls became a Union naval captain, led Black troops in battle, and later won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he fought for civil rights and education.
