I cannot vote for a resolution that sanctifies a public figure who did not reciprocate respect for the lives, dignity and freedoms of others.

'1936870087387992203',"I'm grateful that no American service members were harmed in this strike, and proud of the skill and bravery of the Missouri-based airmen and airwomen who carried out their mission. Our troops always deserve our respect, no matter who is president.

I never for a second doubted our military's ability to strike its targets. But taking out facilities is the easy part. It's what comes next that's hard-and we've seen how this story goes.

Launching airstrikes without consulting Congress, without a clear strategy, and without providing transparency to the American people is not an acceptable path forward. I am also extremely worried that the massive risk of escalation will further put our service members at risk.

If we desire peace in the region, we can never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. It would be incredibly naive to believe that if Iran obtained a nuclear weapon that they would not use it. But the Administration has an obligation to brief Congress and outline their objectives for the timing of this action. We cannot be dragged into another war in the Middle East by those who have learned nothing from the last two decades.
