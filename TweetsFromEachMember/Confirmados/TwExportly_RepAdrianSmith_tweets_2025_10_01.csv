He closed by saying, “When the lights come, and the ships sail home in peace, I will stop for a piece of that delicious looking home-made cake.”

'1930347885645967473',"#OTD in NE History: In 1943, the Syracuse Journal-Democrat recorded a late spring heat wave and storms combined to result in stifling humidity. The patriotic wartime attitude of Nebraskans was captured in a quote from a local Syracusean, “Why complain? Think of the boys in Africa!”

The following day, a letter from “somewhere in Africa” appeared in the North Platte Daily Telegraph, sent by American Captain Adolphe J. Dickman who lauded the hospitality of “The charming ladies of the North Platte Canteen.”

In the letter he recalled the “far away dream” of coming through North Platte the day after Christmas and receiving “hot coffee, sandwiches, coffee again, chewing gum and a swell Christmas present.”

Capt. Dickman was born in Belgium and immigrated to the U.S. following decorated service in the First World War. He was a professor of language at Baylor University, Iowa, and Wyoming before serving as a liaison officer for French and American forces during the North African campaign.

In gratitude to the North Platte Canteen, he wrote, “attentions like those you gave are not forgotten…Keep the home fires burning and remember the boys ‘somewhere all over the world.’”

'1925278133693161910',"#OTD in NE History: In 1943, the North Platte Daily Telegraph printed this moving letter written by a soldier from Hawaii, who praised the hospitality and “wide awake and hustling spirit” of the North Platte Canteen as “good morale builders.”

Private Larry T. Mizumoto passed through Nebraska on his way to Mississippi’s Camp Shelby and wrote of his motivation to volunteer for a combat team composed of Japanese Americans, “our hearts are all for America. We have been through Pearl Harbor…Some of us lost our good friends and even brothers and sisters and dear Mom and Dad on that fateful day…and we are here to see that Tojo and his stooges are put just where they belong.”

He said of willingness to do his patriotic duty, “We realize that a lot of us won’t be coming home when it’s over, over there. But as long as there are such people like you folks in this country, America, land of liberty and justice, we are more than willing to die for you.” Sadly, Private Mizumoto lost his life two months before the surrender of Japan on July 8, 1945, in what is recorded as a non-combat death. His courage, sacrifice, and stirring message are not forgotten.
