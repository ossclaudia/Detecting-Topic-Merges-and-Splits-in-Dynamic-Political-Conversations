Through this bill—utilities have invested millions in modernizing our electric grid, lowering energy costs, and spurring a clean energy and manufacturing renaissance in America. And, New Mexico has been leading the way.

But, since day one, the Trump Admin has launched an all-out assault on clean energy jobs, freezing funding, repealing critical investments in the Big Ugly Bill, driving utility prices up, and costing the U.S. 64,000 clean energy jobs since the end of last year.

That is 64,000 people who lost access to good-paying jobs, benefits, and the ability to put food on the table.
