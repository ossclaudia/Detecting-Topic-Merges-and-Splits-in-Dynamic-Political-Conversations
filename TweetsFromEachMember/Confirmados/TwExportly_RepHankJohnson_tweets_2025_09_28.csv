The damage will have already been done when the cases arrive back before the Court for final decision. This breathtaking shift of power to the Presidency does grievous harm to the system of checks and balances that has enabled 249 years of American democracy to thrive. Under our Constitution, Congress has the sole authority to dismantle any U.S. department — not Donald Trump or billionaire drug-addled Elon Musk’s 'DOGE.'

'1890540287199723958',"On his first day as Secretary of Health and Human Services, @SecKennedy. deliberately crippled the U.S. response to threats to our public health by firing approximately 1,300 CDC employees. These cuts affected career professionals and staffers who have spent years fighting diseases and supporting our communities. He defended this decision by saying he is “following the Administration's guidance and taking action to support the President's broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government.”

Let me be clear: this is yet another attempt by co-Presidents @elonmusk and @realDonaldTrump to slash essential services at the expense of the American people while making room for billionaire tax breaks. This is the same administration that pulled the U.S. out of the World Health Organization and the same President who once suggested injecting bleach as treatment for COVID-19. Now co- President Trump has appointed a man notorious for spreading dangerous anti-vaccine propaganda and health misinformation as the highest health official in the country. These reckless decisions not only harm the federal workers who have dedicated their careers to protecting us and serving our communities in GA-04 and metro Atlanta, but it also endangers the American public during a time of increased health concerns and looming dangers.

We cannot afford to stand by as the Trump administration dismantles our public health system, leaving Americans vulnerable and putting lives on the line. Their reckless policies threaten to cripple the very infrastructure we rely on to prevent disease outbreaks, respond to health emergencies, and ensure access to care. The safety and well-being of our families should never be bartered away for political gains or billionaire tax breaks.
