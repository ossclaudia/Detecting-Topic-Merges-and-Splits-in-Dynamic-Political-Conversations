'1969052339257446442',"Today, I joined my colleagues in condemning the assassination of Charlie Kirk.
 
The foundation of our nation’s democracy is freedom of speech, enshrined in the first amendment to our constitution.
 
Recently, we’ve seen an increase in political violence on both sides of the aisle, first with the killing of two lawmakers in Minnesota, and now Charlie Kirk. Political assassinations and other acts of violence hurt our freedom of speech, our democracy, and our Nation.
 
While I may not agree with Charlie Kirk’s views, freedom of speech must be protected. It is the hallmark of American Democracy. And that’s why I also strongly disagree with the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, and the abrupt cancellation of the Stephen Colbert show, for merely expressing their first amendment rights.
 
We must reject all forms of violence, encourage dialogue, and push for respectful political discourse. We can disagree on our views and our message, but it should never lead to political violence or political assassination, or the silencing of voices we might disagree with.",en,Tweet,0,8,1,10,1953,2025-09-19 15:53:55,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

The only exception is for direct aid to individuals, which means Social Security and Medicare.

Any other type of funding from a federal agency will likely be paused—potentially including Medicaid, federal-aid highway programs, housing assistance for tenants, child nutrition programs, and grants for colleges and universities.

This likely violates impoundment law, which blocks the President from unilaterally withholding money without the consent of Congress.
