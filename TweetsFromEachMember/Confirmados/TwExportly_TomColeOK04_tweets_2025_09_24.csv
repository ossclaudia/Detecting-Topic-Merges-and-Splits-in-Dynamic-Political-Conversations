'1969926147040256085',"Today, a memorial service was held for Charlie Kirk in Arizona. Following the service, I released the following statement: 
 
Charlie Kirk was a good man. He was a dedicated Christian, who allowed his faith to guide him in all he did. He was a true patriot who loved the United States of America with all his heart. He believed in strong family values and was a devoted husband to his wife, Erika, and father to his two children. He was a leader and mentor to many with the talented ability to connect with the American people, particularly the youth, through his public speaking skills and successful conservative nonprofit, Turning Point USA.
 
Charlie believed in the importance of civil discourse and public debate. When Charlie visited college campuses, he was not there to give speeches and presentations. Instead, he was there to respectfully take questions from students – no matter what side of the political aisle they were on – and try to find understanding of one another. In fact, I was looking forward to welcoming Charlie to my district this fall, as he was scheduled to be at the University of Oklahoma in Norman on October 16. Now, we unfortunately won’t get that opportunity.
 
Yet, it was in this exact setting, while he was in the literal act of public dialogue, that Charlie was assassinated. It is just sick, tragic, and harrowing. It fills me with grief, not only for his family, friends, and Turning Point USA colleagues, but for our entire nation, as political violence of any kind is never acceptable and, quite frankly, is un-American.
 
I have full faith in Director Kash Patel, the FBI, and Utah law enforcement as they actively work to bring justice to Charlie Kirk. However, we, as Americans, should also honor his legacy by engaging in genuine civil debate with those on the other side of the aisle, allowing faith and strong family values to guide us in our lives daily, spreading Charlie’s strong conservative message, and by coming together as a nation to fight back against the evil that exists in this country.
 
I am confident that we will overcome this dark chapter. In the meantime, please join me in praying for the soul of Charlie Kirk, his family, his friends, his fans, and our country. May Charlie Kirk rest in peace.",en,Tweet,8,193,19,13,15693,2025-09-22 01:46:07,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Today, on the anniversary of this tragic day, I pause to remember and honor the 2,977 innocent lives lost too soon, the loved ones they left behind, the courageous first responders who acted with extraordinary bravery that day and continue to serve, the survivors who live with trauma to this day, and the countless Americans who came together in the face of tragedy to support one another.

September 11, 2001 is a day I will truly never forget. While our country was deeply shaken, America itself was not broken. In the face of tragedy, we demonstrated resilience, unity, and strength – showing the world that even in our darkest hour, the United States will endure. That truth remains just as powerful today and every day. So, as we remember and reflect on this horrific day, let’s do so with respect for those we lost, hope for a better future, and love for this great country we call home.",en,Tweet,0,6,0,4,811,2025-09-11 14:24:25,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

After giving every chance to negotiate a solution, President Trump has ended years of appeasement that has emboldened the Iranian regime and its evil mullahs, the leading state sponsor of terror. It was an important and absolutely necessary step to neutralize a direct nuclear threat to regional and world peace and stability. This targeted action, only at nuclear sites, dramatically reduces risk to America, our troops, and our steadfast ally, Israel. The United States will always stand resolutely against terrorism and aggression. The Iranian regime has been disingenuous and unreliable - we've had no choice but to act. In face of threats, you will be met with strength – because that is how peace is kept.

'1934299123760373859',"On this Father’s Day, I can’t help but reflect and be thankful for my own father, John Cole.

My late father lived a dutiful life, dedicating everything to not only our family, but also our country. He spent twenty years in the Air Force, making exponential sacrifices every single day for this nation, and then worked an additional two decades as a civilian federal employee at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma.

Growing up, and still today, I greatly admired my dad’s service. He was truly a hero. He joined the Army Air Corps on the eve of World War II and by the time he left the military, he was the second most senior master sergeant in the Air Force. My father was known throughout the USAF as the one of the best to run a crew to maintenance airplanes. In fact, he won the “Dock of the Month” prize so many times that McGuire Air Force Base stopped giving the prize out as a whole. Then, when he was placed at Dover Air Force Base, he was assigned the worst dock. Yet, without surprise, he still managed to win the same award seven times at Dover – a testament to his impressive mechanic skills.

Unfortunately, during the last several years of his life, my father battled Alzheimer’s disease. My mother, brother, and I watched him helplessly and with heavy hearts as he became a different person and slowly lost a lifetime of memories throughout the various stages of the disease. He fought the disease with all his strength, but he sadly lost the battle. Yet, the lessons my dad taught me still live on in my heart. I got my strong work ethic from him and am thankful every day that I had a father worth missing so much.

So, as we all celebrate our fathers today, let us remember to thank them for the examples they have set, the love they have shown, and the legacies they have left behind.
