'1961138358186545428',"Last night, I had dinner with and spoke to more than 100 constituents at a Lewis County Chamber of Commerce event.

As a native of Lewis County, and the former County Judge/Executive, it was a pleasure to see so many familiar faces, including current Judge/Executive George Sparks, Lewis County Attorney Ben Harrison, Kentucky State Representative Patrick Flannery, Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, and Warrior Ridge founder Landon Bentley. Thanks to Lewis County Sheriff Johnny Bivens and his deputies for keeping Lewis County safe. I shared a few stories from my time in local office and expressed my sincere appreciation for the work our county officials do.

I also expressed how seriously I take my vote in Congress. My vote does not belong to the Republican Party, to the Speaker of the House, or to whomever is in the White House—it belongs to the 750,000 people of the Fourth District. One issue that often influences how I vote is our rising national debt. I showed those in attendance the debt badge I built and wear and explained how it is meant to raise awareness among my colleagues of just how serious our debt crisis is. My goal is for each of them, every time they vote, to consider this rapidly growing number and how it will—and already is—affecting the future of this country, our children, and grandchildren.

Another priority of mine is to help the counties and communities in my district without growing government. The PRIME Act is a piece of legislation I’ve introduced that would serve all Americans, but would greatly benefit agricultural areas, such as Lewis County. Currently, in order to sell individual cuts of locally raised meats to consumers, farmers and ranchers must first send their animals to one of a limited number of USDA-inspected slaughterhouses. The PRIME Act would give individual states freedom to permit intrastate distribution of custom-slaughtered meat such as beef, pork, or lamb to consumers, restaurants, hotels, boarding houses, and grocery stores. I am hopeful that provisions from the PRIME Act will be included in this year’s Farm Bill. The PRIME Act would also be a fitting addition to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s plan to Make America Healthy Again (MAHA).

A special thank you to Joni Pugh, who serves on the Lewis County Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, for inviting me to speak. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the opportunity to reconnect with so many people doing great things in Lewis County.",en,Tweet,45,3412,389,215,94577,2025-08-28 19:46:35,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzdQmAUW0AAFvlk.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzdQqvJWEAAjtnn.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzdQsmtXEAA1EWh.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzdQtu7WcAAHpWY.jpg"

'1952875088358879725',"Today, I had the privilege of meeting with several Northern Kentucky city and county managers at the Boone Links Golf & Event Center in Florence. It was great to speak with local officials who represent the same communities I do. I addressed a number of topics, including local infrastructure, fiscal policy, and federal regulatory issues affecting Kentucky’s Fourth Congressional District.

I discussed the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, or CVG. It’s exciting to see how CVG is expanding—not only as a travel hub, but also as a center for cargo and distribution. CVG is a major employer in Northern Kentucky and a key driver of our local economy. As a long-serving member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and several of its subcommittees, I’ve consistently supported policies aimed at improving air travel, ensuring sufficient airport revenue, and enhancing safety.

I also talked about my role on the House Judiciary Committee, where I work to protect Second Amendment rights and civil liberties. On the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, Artificial Intelligence, and the Internet, I have been a steadfast proponent of intellectual property rights and legislation that protects inventors and startups.

After giving the managers an update on my work in Congress and my committee assignments, I took some of their questions. The first question was an excellent one: Why isn’t the national debt front and center in every discussion taking place at the federal level? For too long, Congress has failed to address the debt. Federal politicians view it as an inconvenient truth that will eventually be our grandchildren’s problem. What we’re now seeing is the debt affecting interest rates in real time. It is becoming difficult for Kentuckians to purchase a home, buy a car, or save money for their kids’ college tuition. I will continue raising awareness about the federal deficit, and I will continue to oppose legislation that increases it.

One official expressed concern about the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) rule requiring full replacement of lead service lines within 10 years. While local officials understand the need to replace these pipes, such a short timeline would significantly impact municipalities' ability to manage their budgets while also preserving existing infrastructure, such as roads. I acknowledged that arbitrary deadlines like this can pose real challenges, and I suggested working behind the scenes to secure additional time or flexibility for implementation. This rule is currently under judicial review, and I will be closely monitoring the Court’s final decision to understand how it may affect the communities in my district.

I’ve always said that those serving in local government have a greater impact on your day-to-day life than those serving in Washington. The officials who gathered today are genuinely committed to improving the lives of Northern Kentuckians.

Thank you, Chris Moriconi, City Administrator, Independence; Taylor Froelicher, Public Administration Specialist, Northern Kentucky Area Development District; Gary Moore, Judge/Executive, Boone; Mark Collier, Assistant City Administrator, Erlanger; Alex Mattingly, City Administrator, Crestview Hills; Jill Bailey, City Administrative Officer, Fort Wright; Sam Shelton, Assistant City Administrator, Bellevue; Amy Safran, City Administrator, Union; Matthew Webster, County Administrator, Boone; Brian Dehner, City Administrator, Edgewood; David Plummer, City Administrator, Alexandria; Adam Chaney, Executive Director, Sanitation District No. 1; Tara Johnson-Noem, Executive Director, Northern Kentucky Area Development District; Lindsey Rechtin, President/CEO, Northern Kentucky Water District; and Jay Fossett, City Administrator, Dayton.

'1907812413921005696',"In this episode of in-the-weeds, I’ll talk about how the Rules Committee, a.k.a. the Speaker’s committee, can circumvent House rules and even federal laws that govern House rules.

There are House rules and federal laws that allow rank and file members in specific circumstances to bring legislation to the floor without the Speaker’s approval. But the Speaker can use the rules committee to “turn off” these special procedures, if he can get a majority of members of the whole House to vote for the Rules Committee Resolution to disable these special procedures.

Let’s look at three methods for expediting legislation, that the Speaker can thwart if he can pass a tailored resolution on the floor from the Rules Committee.

1. Discharge Petition
If a member can get 218 colleagues to sign a discharge petition, legislation can be brought to the floor against the Speaker’s wishes. I’ve only seen this done a couple of times in the twelve years I’ve served in Congress. It’s rare because it’s considered an act of rebellion by majority members against the Speaker. It was once used to pass a bill reauthorizing the Import/Export Bank ostensibly without the approval of Speaker Boehner, but Boehner had announced his resignation and was a weak at the time.

This week, Rep Luna, in an act of defiance against Speaker Johnson, employed a discharge petition to expedite consideration of Democrat legislation to allow new mothers in Congress to vote remotely. She acquired the requisite 218 votes by enlisting all democrats and a few Republican colleagues.

The Rules Committee offered a resolution to “turn off” the House rule that enabled her discharge petition. The resolution also contained procedures for bringing popular Republican bills to the floor that dealt with election integrity and rogue judges. The Speaker gambled that Republicans wouldn’t vote against a resolution that enabled these popular bills. I voted FOR the Soeaker’s resolution to disable the discharge petition because I agree with the Speaker’s attempt to prevent what I consider to be unconstitutional legislation from coming to the floor, and (b) the resolution modified house rules, instead of thwarting the intent of standing federal law.

The Resolution from the Rules committee failed because nine republicans joined Rep Luna and all democrats in voting against the Rules Committee Resolution that would have disabled Luna’s discharge petition. They set up a game of chicken, and the cars crashed into each other.

Unless the Speaker has more tricks up his sleeve, next week we vote on the Democrat legislation to give a sort of maternity leave to members of Congress.

2. War Powers Act

The War Powers Act sets forth an expedited procedure for Congress to countermand the Executive branch when the Executive conducts acts of war without congressional authorization. According to FEDERAL LAW, any member can bring this resolution to the floor quickly. In the past, Speakers have successfully used a Rules Committee resolution (passed by the whole House) to stop a vote on the issue of war from coming to the House floor. How can federal law be thwarted by a House Resolution? The Rules Committee merely has to say in its resolution that the war powers resolution brought forth by the member doesn’t qualify as a war powers resolution (even if it clearly does!). When I served on the Rules Committee last Congress, I made it clear that I would not engage in this nonsense, and I did not.

3. National Emergencies Act
Members can force votes to countermand Executive declarations of National emergencies, such as the one underpinning Trump’s tariffs. This was tried a couple of weeks ago, but the Speaker thwarted federal law with a Rules Committee Resolution. I was the only Republican to vote against the Speaker’s resolution, so his measure carried and we had no vote on the national emergency that underpins Trump’s new tariffs.

'1905047117409800200',"Yesterday, our Judiciary Committee passed HR 38, National Reciprocity. I support this bill, but there is a better option, and it is National Constitutional Carry.

29 states already have Constitutional (i.e. permitless) Carry. Why not extend it to all 50 states?

Under HR 38 (Reciprocity), a resident of one of the Constitutional Carry states can carry in any state that allows their citizens to obtain a permit. The recent “Bruen” Supreme Court decision requires all states that aren’t Constitutional Carry to issue carry permits to their citizens.

This means that when HR 38 passes, any resident of those 29 Constitutional Carry states will be able to carry in any of the 50 states without a permit. Ironically, however, residents of the 21 states (like New York or California) that aren’t Constitutional Carry will need a permit to carry in their own state, while visitors from states that are Constitutional Carry (like Kentucky or Ohio) won’t need a permit to carry in states like New York or California.

If Congress, relying on the Second Amendment, can force California to allow “Permitless” Carry for Kentuckians who visit California, why would we not force California to allow “Permitless” Carry for Californians who are in California? In other words, why not pass National Constitutional Carry and afford everyone in the United States the right to “bear arms” which is enshrined in the Constitution?

The other quirk of HR 38 is that (I believe) it would allow a person from Kentucky to carry an AR-15 pistol with a 20-round magazine in California, while Californians would not be allowed to carry, or even own, the same equipment. The Supreme Court decision in “D.C. v. Heller,” whether you agree with it or not, allows states to have some regulations on firearm equipment and eligibility to possess, but HR 38 seems to contradict that framework.

Contrast this with my National Constitutional Carry bill which basically says if a state allows people to possess (KEEP) a particular firearm, that state must also allow people to carry (BEAR) that firearm.

I introduced my National Constitutional Carry bill in committee yesterday as a substitute amendment to HR 38, National Reciprocity. After introducing the amendment for the record and describing it, I withdrew the amendment instead of putting my Judiciary Committee colleagues in the position of deciding whether to replace National Reciprocity with National Constitutional Carry. The dilemma is that not enough Republicans in the whole House understand the difference, and the prevailing opinion is that Reciprocity can pass the whole House, but Constitutional Carry cannot.

Perhaps when more of my colleagues who are not on the Judiciary Committee understand why we should pass National Constitutional Carry instead of (or in addition to) National Reciprocity, we can make a strong push to report National Constitutional Carry out of the Judiciary Committee for a vote in the full House of Representatives.

'1894721326608261610',"This is a tricky one. It’s H Con Res 14, not an HR. 

It is a concurrent resolution that originates in the House and it will require concurrence (passage) by the Senate but not the President’s signature as it is not law. It binds Congress, but not the people or the administration, so the President doesn’t need to sign it.

This HConRes is what is formally known as the budget and sets the parameters for the reconciliation bill that will be a law signed by the President. As @ChristaBanet said, the reconciliation bill is not written yet. It will be able to pass with 51 votes in the Senate, and it affects mandatory spending (about 70% of our overall spending). There is no “due date” for the reconciliation bill since mandatory spending is on autopilot. This particular HConRes (aka the budget) also sets broad parameters for the annual discretionary spending bill.

Discretionary spending (the other 30% of the budget), is due every September 30th, but due to CR’s (kicking the can) the discretionary spending bill is due on March 14th. It also hasn’t been written yet. It should be 12 separate bills, but it usually takes the form of a combined bill called an omnibus (or two minibuses, or some other bastard variation of what is actually supposed to be 12 bills). If discretionary spending runs out without being renewed, a so-called government shutdown results. Discretionary spending requires 60 votes in the Senate due to their rules.

'1894383653553127758',"When I was County Judge Executive in Lewis County Kentucky, I was responsible for signing the check that paid for every phone landline and cellphone billed to the county.

At first it seemed impossible to ferret out the waste, fraud, and abuse for these phone plans.

How many phones were taxpayers paying for that were defunct? How many were former county employees who were no longer employed but had been able to keep their phone and mooch off the taxpayer? Was any of it fraudulent or inaccurate billing by the service provider?

But then I came up with an idea… I told every county department (Sheriff, Clerk, Road Crew, Jail, etc.) to give me a list of their phones matched to their county employees or offices.

In one month, I would DEACTIVATE EVERY PHONE that wasn’t on one of these lists.

A month went by and only about 80% complied with the directive to list their phones. I gave them one more month and issued a serious warning that their phones would be turned off at the end of the next month.

Finally, I directed the phone company to deactivate all phones that weren’t accounted for. Guess what?

The jailer called me up and said the finger print machine wouldn’t send finger prints to the state police anymore. Ha! That was the only legitimate phone line that I deactivated. We quickly got it reactivated.

I ended up saving our county thousands of dollars on the phone bill, much to the chagrin of the phone company and a few moochers who no longer had free phone plans. I think most of the savings came from phones that just weren’t in service but had been left on the bill.

Why do I tell this story? Because what Elon is doing by asking federal employees to list five things they did in a week is brilliant. Requiring any kind of an affirmative response from a worker will prove whether that worker even exists and can be reached. Don’t forget, the Inspector General for Afghanistan found out we were paying millions for soldiers and police in Afghanistan who didn’t even exist (ghost employees). There’s no telling what Elon’s plan will uncover. We will find some employees can’t use email or aren’t even literate enough to write five things. So everyone take a chill pill and write down your five things to let us know you exist and you can read email and you aren’t completely insubordinate.

'1894360938314100769',"I asked Grok if ethanol subsidies and mandates increase food prices. Here’s Grok’s answer:

Ethanol mandates and subsidies can indeed push up food prices, and here’s how it plays out. In the U.S., the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires blending ethanol—mostly made from corn—into gasoline. Subsidies, like tax credits or direct payments to producers, sweeten the deal for ethanol makers. This jacks up demand for corn, a staple crop for both fuel and food. When more corn gets diverted to ethanol refineries, less is left for livestock feed, processed foods, or export markets. Basic supply and demand kicks in: reduced corn supply for food purposes means higher prices for corn-based products.

Look at the numbers. In 2022, about 40% of U.S. corn production—roughly 5.3 billion bushels—went to ethanol, according to the USDA. That’s a massive chunk of a crop that also feeds cattle, pigs, and chickens. When corn prices rise—say, from $3 a bushel to $7, like they did between 2020 and 2022—feed costs for livestock climb too. That ripples through to higher prices for beef, pork, eggs, and dairy at the grocery store. A 2011 National Academy of Sciences study pegged the RFS as bumping corn prices by 20-40% in tight supply years. More recent analyses, like from Iowa State’s CARD in 2023, suggest ethanol policies still add about 10-15% to corn prices annually, depending on harvest yields and global demand.

It’s not just corn, either. Land that could grow wheat, soy, or other crops gets planted with corn instead because ethanol keeps corn profitable—subsidies have historically pushed corn’s return per acre above other grains. The USDA says cropland devoted to corn hit 92 million acres in 2023, crowding out alternatives. Less wheat or soy means tighter supplies and higher prices for bread, cooking oil, and tofu too.

On the flip side, ethanol backers argue it’s not the mandates alone—global factors like weather, oil prices, and trade wars mess with food costs too. They’re not wrong; the 2022 Ukraine invasion spiked grain prices worldwide, ethanol or not. Plus, ethanol coproducts like distillers’ grains get fed back to livestock, offsetting some feed cost hikes. A 2021 Renewable Fuels Association report claimed this keeps the food price impact under 5%. But that’s a tough sell when corn prices drive so much of the ag economy—USDA data shows a $1 increase in corn per bushel adds about $0.40 to a pound of retail beef over time.

Globally, it’s messier. In poorer countries, where people spend 30-50% of income on food (vs. 10% in the U.S.), ethanol-driven grain price jumps hit harder. The 2007-2008 food crisis partly blamed U.S. ethanol policies for spiking corn and tortilla prices in Mexico—FAO estimated a 10-15% food price bump there tied to biofuels.

So, yeah, ethanol mandates and subsidies generally nudge food prices up—how much depends on harvests, markets, and policy tweaks. Without them, corn might stay cheaper, but gas prices could climb unless oil steps in. It’s a trade-off: fuel security vs. food affordability. What’s your take on balancing those?",en,Reply,169,3318,607,368,255127,2025-02-25 12:16:57,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

First let me note that the “vote for Mike” camp is not trying to make the case that Mike Johnson is endowed with the qualities necessary to lead our conference. Even you have limited yourself here to procedural justifications for his speakership rather than telling us why he is a good or capable leader.

Even if Mike’s entire goal is to do everything Trump wants without debate or question (which I would argue is not healthy for the institution of Congress), he’s not going to be good at it. He already demonstrated this month that he won’t tell the President what is achievable and what is not achievable in the House, and he lacks the situational awareness himself to know what can pass and what cannot.

1. “What do we hope to gain?”
A competent Speaker who has the will and the ability to capitalize on this once in a decade opportunity. Johnson is not up for this task. Also, we want a Speaker who inspires the public and who can make our case in the media, so we can keep the majority for the second half of Trump’s term. Johnson nearly led us to the minority in what was a banner year for Trump. He is certain to lose us the majority in 2026.

2. “No one can get more votes.”
It’s somewhat ridiculous to assert that Mike Johnson is the only member of Congress electable to Speaker. He was only electable the first time because he hadn’t held any type of leadership position, nor had he ever fought for anything, so no one disliked him and everyone was tired of voting. He won by being the least objectionable candidate, and he no longer possesses that title.

3. “Risk crippling Trump’s win.”
This is argument is a scare tactic, meant to stampede the masses, plain and simple. There is no legal or parliamentary argument for nullifying the national election if a speaker is not in place on January 6th.

4. “They are allies of the democrats”
Actually it is Mike Johnson who routinely passes  major legislation (Ukraine, Omnibus, FISA spying) with only a minority of republicans, and relying on most democrats. He also owes his current speakership to the democrats. Here’s the roll call for the motion to table the motion to vacate last summer. Pelosi and Jeffries teamed up to save Johnson:
