This bill will expand access to life-saving eating disorder treatment for seniors.

Eating disorders affect seniors at rates similar to the general population, but Medicare doesn’t cover Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for these conditions, leaving seniors & people with disabilities without access to necessary treatment.

Left untreated, eating disorders can lead to heart failure, kidney failure, diabetes, and more, which is why the Nutrition CARE Act is so critical. This bill will help ensure that all individuals with eating disorders can access the services they need to recover and stay healthy.

I'm grateful to my colleagues for partnering with me to make Medicare more comprehensive. For more information on the bill and @EDCoalition and my colleagues' statements in support, please visit:
