As school doors have opened, we celebrate Ms. Aeonique Brown, an inspiring educator in Roanoke Rapids. Ms. Brown has dedicated her life to helping children believe in themselves and succeed. In her classroom, confidence and resilience grow alongside reading and math. 

Through daily affirmations, reflective journaling, and encouragement, she helps students see their worth and build the courage to try even when learning feels hard. Beyond the classroom, Ms. Brown mentors young girls in the Ladies of Distinction program, supports families at school events, and shows up for her community.

She was named the 2024–2025 Beginning Teacher of the Year at Gaston STEM Leadership Academy and Northampton County Schools. Ms. Brown is shaping the future one student at a time.

Natakey Owens is a beacon of hope and strength in her community. As a licensed cosmetologist in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, she does more than style hair—she provides guidance on family, faith, finances, and fitness. For over 26 years, she has built deep relationships with her clients, offering support that extends far beyond beauty.

But it’s her work outside the salon that truly defines her impact. After losing her mother, Pamela D. Page, to domestic violence, Natakey turned her pain into purpose, founding the Pamela D. Page Foundation to support survivors. The foundation provides advocacy, education, and therapeutic support through initiatives like the annual 5K walk/run, Life After Trauma Gala, and Hair & Fashion Show.

Beyond events, Natakey’s foundation hosts workshops, mental health fairs, and support programs for survivors and families. As a survivor herself, she knows the power of community and works tirelessly to create safe spaces for healing. In recognition of her impact, Natakey was honored with the 2025 Humanity Service Award from the City of Rocky Mount.

Thank you, Natakey, for your unwavering commitment to making a difference.

Corey Gooden, a resident of Edenton, is a true community leader whose influence extends well beyond his responsibilities as the town manager. He demonstrates leadership and compassion through mentoring young people, coaching youth sports, and organizing community events. His active involvement with his church and support for his neighbors underscore his dedication to building a stronger, more connected community.

When Hurricane Helene struck western North Carolina, Corey quickly sprang into action to help restore essential water and sewer services in Old Fort, NC. Deployed twice with NC Emergency Management and NC WaterWARN, he assisted residents without utilities for over nine days. In every joyful or challenging situation, Corey rises to the occasion with steadfast determination and an unwavering commitment to others. We proudly highlight his service and efforts to go above and beyond.

Ayana Lewis, a Henderson native, co-founded Abria’s Chase Foundation, Inc., which supports families experiencing traumatic events. Ayana and her husband, June, formed the Abria's Chase Foundation, Inc. in memory of their daughter, Abria Jhune Lewis, and son, Joshua Chase Lewis, who both died in a house fire. Their deaths have become a “call to action.”

Partnering with the Vance County Fire Department, the Abria’s Chase Foundation educates and raises public awareness through literature and free home safety inspections, smoke detector checks, and battery replacements. It also aids families victimized by fires by offering grief support groups. As a result of her work, Ayana was an inaugural recipient of the Franklin-Vance-Warren Opportunity Women’s Economic Equity Council’s Professional Woman of the Year award. 

We are grateful for Ayana, who saves lives in her community as she grows strength from adversity.
