'1926021168621863166',"From the very beginning of this proposed acquisition, I was steadfast in voicing serious concerns about the implications of foreign ownership – particularly Nippon Steel’s record on trade practices – and the critical importance of preserving American control over our steel production, which is vital to our national security.

In the months since, as the Vice Chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, I’ve listened closely to the many voices raised across the political spectrum, including from the prior administration and the Trump Administration.  It is clear that this unified front of concern and advocacy played a crucial role in shaping the terms, incentives, and safeguards now in place.

Thanks to this persistent and bipartisan pressure, we are in a stronger, more secure position today than we were at the time of the initial announcement.  But let me be clear: this is not the end of our oversight.  Nippon Steel must be held to every promise made – from promises to the hardworking steelworkers of Northwest Indiana and the City of Gary, to the economic and strategic interests of the United States.  We will not hesitate to act if those commitments are broken.
