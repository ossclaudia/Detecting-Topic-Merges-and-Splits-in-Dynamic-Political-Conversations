'1965206629256745459',"I agree with the Appeals Court. The intent of the Constitution is for POTUS to work with Congress on tariffs, not for the Executive Branch to be the sole decision maker. Specifically the Constitution gives tax & tariff authorities to the Legislative Branch. Congress would support some of the tariffs. For example most of us agree China has been completely one-sided in the trade relationship & we need to fix that.

Further, the CBO estimates 2.6 million people are on Medicaid who are ineligible or illegal, and by removing them we strengthen the program for people who really need Medicaid. Nebraskans for Us must want ineligible people to be on Medicaid.
