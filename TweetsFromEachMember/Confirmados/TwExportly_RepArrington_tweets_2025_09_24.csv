'1957898174665994715',"Just weeks after rescinding Biden’s radical Green New Deal proposal to expand the Muleshoe Wildlife Refuge by over 10,000%, we’re back in Bailey County discussing the importance of standing up for Rural America against federal overreach.  
 
I vehemently opposed this federal land grab for several reasons:

First, I believe in private property rights. The federal government should not take over vast swaths of land in the name of radical environmental initiatives like Biden’s 30x30 Plan and the Green New Deal.  

Second, the claim that the expansion was necessary to protect endangered species is simply not true, as the populations of the animals listed under this plan are thriving.

Third, the federal government has failed to manage the land it already controls, as the maintenance backlog for the National Wildlife Refuge System is over $2.6 billion. If the government can’t manage the land it already owns, why in the world would we expect that it can handle more?

Fourth, the slashing of the local tax base would decimate schools, public safety, and important services in West Texas, as the federal government does not adequately reimburse communities for land purchases.

Fifth, this would enable more federal overreach similar to the Biden Administration’s weaponization of federal agencies against farmers, independent energy producers, and the State of Texas’s efforts to secure the border.

Iran is run by a terrorist regime who has unequivocally stated their intention to develop nuclear weapons in order to destroy Israel.

Rule number one in self defense:  when someone threatens the lives of you and your family, believe them; and, then do everything in your power to prevent it. 

The previous Administration didn’t understand that basic principle and their policy of appeasement was received by allies and enemies alike as weakness, which only emboldened Iran to accelerate their nuclear power ambitions.

President Trump doesn’t want war, but peace requires a willing partner.  The Iranian regime has shown no change in policy or posture including ending their nuclear weapons program, killing American troops, funding terrorists in the region, and supporting Hamas’ October 2023 terrorist attack on Israel.

'1917223276482384268',"In the first 100 days of President Trump’s second term our nation has experienced unprecedented achievements in a new era of American politics defined by competent leadership, common sense policies, and a commitment to America first.

Among other notable achievements, the President has decreased illegal border crossings to the lowest amount in recorded history, stopped the invasion of our country by para-military drug cartels and violent criminals, deported criminal aliens in record numbers, and restored rule of law in our country.

Under his leadership, we are producing better trade deals for U.S. workers, manufacturers, and ag producers, driving down prices for American families, all while onshoring hundreds of billions of dollars of investments and thousands of good-paying jobs. We are right-sizing the bureaucracy, reining-in reckless spending, and rooting-out waste and fraud, and have already cut $200 billion in unnecessary burdensome regulations.

President Trump ended the woke and weaponized federal government, ensuring the levers of power are no longer used to harass our citizens, radicalize our children, and indoctrinate our troops. We have a Commander in Chief and a Pentagon whose focus is supporting our troops, strengthening our military readiness, and restoring peace through strength.

President Trump is on track to have the most consequential presidency in modern history, and this is just the beginning. The last four years of lawlessness and incompetence have left our nation weaker and more vulnerable than ever before.

As a result of President Trump’s leadership and sense of urgency, Republicans have never been more motivated, unified, and focused on restoring freedom, security, peace, and prosperity, and ushering in a new Golden Age of America.",en,Tweet,0,64,17,10,5044,2025-04-29 15:23:44,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
