This bill is a choice between hurting their own communities and hurting the president’s feelings.

'1917588544979190220',"WATCH: Democratic Leader @RepJeffries addresses Donald Trump’s disastrous first 100 days. This administration has failed the American people. Trump ran his campaign on false hope, race-baiting, and mis/disinformation scare tactics to garner votes. However, he failed to deliver, and his tariffs are shrinking the economy and sending us barreling towards a recession.

What’s more, he’s giving oligarchs access to Americans’ private information, threatening retirees’ hard-earned Social Security benefits, firing veterans, and defunding medical research. Under his direction, Congressional Republicans are cutting Medicaid and essential programs for our most vulnerable just to line the pockets of billionaires. The Trump Administration has only made life harder for the American people.
 
Enough is Enough!

'1901697628833710145',"Let me be very clear: NO ONE believes gang members should walk free in America – but these men have been convicted of NOTHING. No court has found them guilty, and any one of the nearly 300 people targeted could be innocent of what they are accused. There is not a shred of evidence to suggest otherwise. Yet, on the word of Donald Trump alone and against the direct orders of a federal judge, this administration deported them to a foreign prison thousands of miles away. Then they sadistically applauded their humanitarian abuses in a highly produced video for their followers on social media.

And so, the question every American needs to ask today is the same question Americans asked during the internment of our Japanese-American neighbors during World War II, it is the same question Americans asked when lives and livelihoods were destroyed during the Red Scare, it is the same question that should be asked in response to every claim out of the president’s lying mouth: WHERE. IS. YOUR. PROOF? When this administration answers with silence, that will just confirm what we already know – according to Donald Trump, due process is now a relic of America’s past. Innocence is irrelevant, and so is the rule of law. Everything our Constitution stands for is second to what Donald Trump wants, and how hateful and cruel he feels on any given day.
