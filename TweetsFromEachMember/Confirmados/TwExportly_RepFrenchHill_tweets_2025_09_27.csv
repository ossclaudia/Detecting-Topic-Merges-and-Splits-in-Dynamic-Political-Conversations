The new campus in Little Rock will train students, career changers, and returning workers in trades like HVAC, plumbing, and heavy equipment. 

These are high-paying, high-demand jobs. Arkansas employers are ready to hire, and ACEF is making sure people are ready to step in.

'1927073751885381671',"Americans gather this weekend to celebrate the unofficial start of summer and commemorate all those in uniform who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. On this Memorial Day, we should also reflect on the “Stalin of our time,” mass murderer Putin, and his most recent attack on #Ukraine Sunday — the largest of his war: 367 drones and missiles, which killed at least 12 people and injured dozens. This casts a dark shadow over the otherwise hopeful news of nearly 1,000 prisoners exchanged on each side.

European and US leaders should double down on sanctions against #Russia, ending the fact that nearly 70% of their banking system remains “unsanctioned!” The President should use the full power of the #REPO Act to convert frozen Russian assets into funds for Ukraine’s defense and reconstruction, including funding a portion of our strategic minerals agreement.

We must increase the pressure on Russia:
· Impose secondary sanctions
· Enforce the REPO Act
· Shut down the Russian oil trade
· Ensure Ukraine has arms for its defense
· Tell the world how Iran, North Korea, and China are complicit in killing the free people of Ukraine
