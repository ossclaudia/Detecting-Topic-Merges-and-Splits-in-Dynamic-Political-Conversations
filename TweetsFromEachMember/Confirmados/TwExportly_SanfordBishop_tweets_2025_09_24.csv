National defense is not just about weapons and strategy — it's about people. And this bill, as currently written, does not prioritize the needs of our people. Veterans overwhelmingly want to be treated in VA hospitals and clinics — facilities tailored to their unique needs and staffed by professionals who understand the physical, emotional, and psychological costs of service. And, when we fail to provide for the families of our service members, we degrade morale, retention, and focus. We cannot expect excellence from our armed forces if we do not support the very people who make that excellence possible.
