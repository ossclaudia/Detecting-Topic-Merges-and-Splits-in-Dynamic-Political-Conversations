'1966505896437264444',"This morning on Wake Up America, I reflected on the legacy of Charlie Kirk. Charlie engaged diverse views with respect and love. On college campuses—where freedom of speech is sadly dwindling—he used debate to foster honest conversations and challenge young minds to think critically.

We must reject violence, restore civility, and carry forward the kind of open dialogue Charlie so powerfully modeled.

'1966114614908768295',"On this solemn anniversary, we once again vow to Never Forget September 11, 2001. What began as a clear and beautiful morning quickly became a day of unspeakable tragedy and extraordinary heroism.

I remember driving my daughter to school, unaware of the horror that was about to unfold. Like so many Americans, I watched in disbelief as the planes struck the Twin Towers, as the Pentagon was attacked, and as the heroes aboard Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania made the ultimate sacrifice to save countless others.

In the days after, I traveled to Ground Zero, delivering scooters at the request of the NYPD—not for the injured, but for firefighters, police officers, and first responders who had been on their feet for days, navigating the devastation as they worked tirelessly in rescue and recovery efforts.

In the face of tragedy, Americans came together. Streets filled with flags, neighbors lined up to cheer first responders, and chants of “USA” echoed at ballgames and town squares. Out of the darkness of that day came a renewed patriotism and unity that reminded us of who we are as a people.

As President Lincoln declared, “We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” Those words endure today, as our great nation continues to produce patriots who carry forward the cause of freedom and unity—like the late Charlie Kirk, whose life and legacy remind us that America will thrive, and never perish from the earth.",en,Tweet,0,10,1,1,783,2025-09-11 13:20:27,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0kK0pPXYAA61aQ.jpg

He worked tirelessly to foster civil discourse and promote open dialogue where ideas could be debated freely.

The fact that he was shot is heartbreaking and infuriating — and it is the very antithesis of what he stood for. Charlie believed in debate, in persuasion, in the power of words over violence.

Thanks to Rep. Jonathan Fritz and William desRosiers of Coterra Energy for helping organize an insightful and productive discussion. We had a productive conversation about how government and industry can work together to scale up mineral extraction, cut red tape, and bring new investment to energy communities across Pennsylvania.

I also highlighted legislation I will soon introduce to establish a production tax credit for extracting critical minerals—including rare earth elements from coal byproducts and lithium from fracking brine. These credits will help unlock overlooked domestic resources, strengthen U.S. manufacturing, and convert industrial waste streams into valuable supply chain inputs.

With the right policy and private-sector partnership, Pennsylvania is ready to power the next chapter of American energy.

Biden regulators too often used informal “guidance” as a backdoor to enforce policy without accountability.

'1945599618294976524',"This afternoon I joined President Donald Trump, members of Congress, and Angel Families at the White House for the signing of the HALT Fentanyl Act—a critical step to keep lethal fentanyl analogues off our streets and out of our communities.

In 2023 alone, 4,719 Pennsylvanians lost their lives to overdose—nearly 77% involving fentanyl. Without this legislation, a 2018 emergency order from President Trump—classifying fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I—was set to expire, which would have made many of these deadly drugs effectively street-legal.

Thanks to this bill, law enforcement and border agents will retain the authority they need to seize these substances and go after traffickers. It also allows the medical and research communities to continue studying these substances responsibly.

The Energy and Innovation Summit—hosted by Senator Dave McCormick—highlighted over $90 billion in new investment coming directly into Pennsylvania. From natural gas and grid upgrades to AI-powered data centers, this is about unlocking American energy and bringing jobs and growth to rural communities. President Trump’s agenda for energy dominance is being implemented, and Pennsylvania is leading the way.

We also discussed the HALT Fentanyl Act, which will be signed at the White House later this afternoon—and I’ll be there for it. This legislation is critical—it permanently schedules fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs, ensuring law enforcement can keep seizing these deadly compounds and prosecuting traffickers. With over 4,000 fentanyl deaths in Pennsylvania alone, this bill will help save lives and strengthen our border security.

And the investigation into President Biden’s use of the autopen continues to deepen. We now know that both pardons and executive orders were signed using the autopen—likely without his direct authorization. That’s not how the presidency is supposed to work, and the American people deserve answers.

I commend Commissioners: Alan Hall, Dave Darrow, and Bob McNamara, along with State Senator Lisa Baker, and Representative Jonathan Fritz. Their leadership and tireless efforts have been critical in responding to this crisis.

We saw 105 mph winds, golf-ball-sized hail, and massive trees uprooted — some over 150 years old — destroying homes and blocking roads. Thankfully, no serious injuries have been reported.

In conversations with former County Commissioner, Judy Hershel, I contacted the Red Cross early Friday morning, and their swift and outstanding response made a real difference, arriving within an hour to deliver food and support to our neighbors in need.

A special thank you to Ron Cieslak, and all the staff at Schneider’s Market at the Plaza. Their generosity in feeding and supporting the 300+ utility workers — providing water, Gatorade, hamburgers, and more, all at no charge — embodies the very best of Susquehanna County.

As we continue cleanup and power restoration efforts, my office remains fully engaged. We’re working with PEMA, FEMA, and local officials to secure disaster declarations and ensure resources get to those who need them most.

Under this legislation, states can no longer expect federal taxpayers to foot the bill for illegal immigrants on Medicaid. If they choose to cover those costs, they’ll have to do so without federal support.

Despite the rhetoric, no one who is eligible for Medicaid will lose coverage—period. The OBBB protects the long-term integrity of the program and ensures it serves seniors, low-income families, and the disabled.

This bill is a pro-growth plan to rebuild our economy and restore common sense. We’re eliminating taxes on tips up to $25,000, making overtime tax-free up to $12,500, and delivering a $6,000 credit for seniors on Social Security.

'1940490177744449720',"If Congress doesn’t pass the One Big Beautiful Bill, we’re guaranteeing a $4 trillion tax hike on the American people—raising taxes on 165 million taxpayers and over 33 million small businesses. That’s the reality.

This bill addresses the failures of the Biden presidency—unchecked spending, high inflation, stagnant growth, dependence on foreign energy, and a refusal to secure the border. We’re now spending $1 trillion a year just to cover interest payments on a $37 trillion national debt. That’s unsustainable. And it’s why this bill delivers meaningful savings, including necessary reforms to Medicaid and SNAP. 

Since 2018, federal Medicaid spending has surged 60%—from $382 billion to $614 billion in 2023. Yes, some of that came during COVID—but it was never corrected. A huge share of that growth is driven by illegal immigration, lax eligibility enforcement, and governors like Josh Shapiro who refuse to implement basic integrity measures. In fact, according to the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s office, our state has one of the highest rates of Medicaid-related criminal activity in the nation.

Let’s be clear: no one who is eligible for Medicaid or SNAP will lose coverage—full stop. These reforms simply ensure the programs are sustainable and focused on the people they were meant to serve: seniors, the disabled, and low-income families.

That’s what makes Governor Shapiro’s attacks so misleading. Non-partisan estimates show the number of people potentially impacted is a fraction of what he suggests. And to be clear, the only Medicaid beneficiaries who could be impacted fall into just three categories: (1) illegal immigrants; (2) people who are ineligible under the law; and (3) able-bodied adults who refuse to meet a basic 20-hour-per-week work, education, or volunteer requirement—even after a 90-day grace period. Shapiro’s statement signals that he’s comfortable with illegal immigrants drawing taxpayer-funded benefits and willing to let Medicaid and SNAP be exploited by those who were never meant to be on the rolls.

Shapiro and Democrats are fighting to grow government by increasing taxes on working people and small businesses. Republicans are fighting to grow savings, income, and the American economy—while limiting the size and scope of government. If Governor Shapiro wants to make the case for the status quo, he’s free to do so.

'1940181886497956027',"The House’s version of the OBBB rightly sought to remove all illegal immigrants—roughly 1.4 million—from Medicaid rolls. While the Senate ruled that provision out under the Byrd Rule, the final compromise still ensures Medicaid’s integrity and protects resources for American citizens:

•Illegal immigrants are no longer eligible for Medicaid, except in very limited emergency situations—which account for less than 4% of all claims. Under federal law, emergency medical care will still be provided to all who need treatment.

•Starting Oct. 1, 2026, states with illegal immigrants enrolled in their Medicaid program will see their federal reimbursement reduced, shifting more of the cost to states that choose to ignore federal law.

•Only U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful residents will qualify for full Medicaid reimbursement—the other 96% of claims.

This isn’t about denying care—it’s about ensuring that care goes to those who are here legally and preserving the long-term integrity of Medicaid.

'1939772518761365895',"A recent article in our region was misleading about the facts related to nutrition assistance and support for local farmers. So let’s set the record straight: 

While the article focused on farmers market vouchers, it failed to mention that the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program—which those vouchers were designed to supplement, not replace—is on track to receive a $100 million funding increase in FY2026. Those dollars go directly to local farmers and producers.

🔹 The Commodity Supplemental Food Program (meals for seniors) is increasing from $338.6 million in FY2025 to $425 million in FY2026, an $87 million increase.

🔹 The WIC Nutrition Program—the USDA’s largest nutrition initiative—is increasing from $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion, a $100 million increase.

These are real, meaningful increases that directly benefit local farmers and families in need.

Meanwhile, the Citizens Voice article focused on a small, supplemental voucher program that was never intended to be a primary funding source. While the Farmers Market Nutrition Program is being reduced by $8.5 million, that reduction is offset tenfold by a $100 million increase to the core WIC program—which supports the same families in a far more substantial and reliable way.

Reporting focused on a supplemental program while ignoring a substantial funding increase is classic misdirection and disingenuous. So don’t be misled—funding for nutrition assistance is going up, not down.

The United States has carried out a successful, targeted strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. This operation sends a clear and unmistakable message: Iran must never be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon.

These sites were at the core of a regime that funds terror, destabilizes the region, and threatens America and its allies. A nuclear-armed Iran would endanger Israel, inflict global instability, and put countless lives at risk.

Thanks to the extraordinary precision of our Armed Forces, the mission was executed flawlessly, and all aircraft returned safely.

Chairman Powell deserves credit for navigating some of the toughest terrain in modern history with record spending from the Biden Administration during COVID. But with inflation cooling and a strong labor market, the upside of lower rates is becoming hard to miss.

As the U.S. gears up to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill—a generational investment in American industry and innovation—lower rates would supercharge private-sector growth, unlock long-term capital, and help usher in a new golden era of economic dynamism. A rate cut would also kickstart the housing market, which carries powerful multipliers across jobs, materials, and consumer demand.

It would also ease pressure on the federal government’s debt service costs, made worse by years of unchecked Biden-era spending.

'1935388624742182945',"Most will say they agree with Arnold’s comments (hopefully). Why? Because they make total sense.

But why is it that there are so many leaders in the Democrat Party and Democrat governors, including a Pennsylvania Governor whose actions run counter… completely counter to the common sense position Arnold was taking.

Sanctuary cities, cashless bail, support of prosecutors that will not charge illegal immigrants, verbal assault and physical assault of ICE agents trying to do their job, pacifying and downplaying violent protests, suing the President over sending in the National Guard to quell violent riots… all actions and positions taken by the Pennsylvania governor.

Based on Arnold’s rational position on immigration, I think he and all would disagree with those actions.

The Republican Party is the party of legal immigration. High fences but wide gates.

Fortunately, very fortunately, most who come from foreign lands to America whether legal or illegal come and try to be good people. In fact, they hope to gain legal status, and one-day, citizenship for their families so they do the right thing. Those that are here illegally must get right with the law. But clearly there are a portion of those who have illegally entered our country that hate America. They are criminals, and these are the ones that deserve to be handled according to the law.

'1933194602858906092',"I was happy to join @epaleezeldin to announce the proposed revision of two Biden-era energy regulations, as part of the Powering the Great American Comeback initiative—a five-pillar plan that refocuses the EPA on air and water quality, energy security, permitting reform, innovation, and global competitiveness.

This action reflects a balanced, responsible approach to deregulation that supports American energy production, protects the environment, and delivers the certainty our producers need after years of burdensome Biden-era rules that pushed investment overseas and jeopardized our path to energy dominance.

As Administrator Zeldin emphasized, even if finalized, no power plant will be allowed to emit more than it does today or did in recent years. The more energy we produce here at home, the better it is for the planet—because no nation produces energy more responsibly or with lower emissions than the United States.

'1926661085735637492',"In their efforts to oppose commonsense reforms to strengthen Medicaid and ensure its sustainability for the most vulnerable and future Americans, Democrats are once again resorting to fear mongering—not facts.

Below is a breakdown of common Democratic myths and the real facts about the Big Beautiful Bill (BBB) Medicaid provisions:

⸻

DEMOCRAT FEAR MONGERING:

Millions will lose access to Medicaid under cruel new work requirements.

FACT:
The BBB’s Medicaid community engagement provisions apply only to able-bodied adults without dependents—not to seniors, people with disabilities, pregnant women, or caregivers.
Beginning January 1, 2026, these adults can meet the requirement by working, volunteering, attending school, or participating in job training for at least 80 hours a month.

This is not punitive—it’s empowering. It recognizes that Medicaid should support not just health but upward mobility and personal responsibility.

⸻

DEMOCRAT FEAR MONGERING:

Medicaid recipients will be kicked off the program due to paperwork errors and red tape.

FACT:
The BBB combats fraud, waste, and abuse, not eligible recipients.
For example, it ends the “good faith” waiver by 2030, ensuring states can no longer dodge accountability for improper payments to ineligible individuals or providers.

It uses the SSA Death Master File to prevent payments to deceased individuals and creates a federal system to prevent dual-state enrollment.

Verifying eligibility is not “red tape”—it’s responsible governance.

⸻

DEMOCRAT FEAR MONGERING:

The bill targets immigrants and punishes those in need.

FACT:
Federal law has long required that Medicaid recipients be citizens or legal residents.

The BBB strengthens enforcement by ending federal funding during the 90-day verification period for those without verified status.

No funding will go to those who are ineligible under federal law—this includes approximately 1.4 million illegal immigrants and 1.2 million other ineligible individuals who are currently on the rolls. 

⸻

DEMOCRAT FEAR MONGERING:

States will be penalized for trying to provide compassionate care.

FACT:
Beginning in 2028, states that deliberately fund health care for undocumented immigrants through Medicaid-like programs will face a 10% reduction in federal Medicaid matching funds.

This ensures that Medicaid remains focused on U.S. citizens and legal residents—the populations it was designed to serve.

⸻

DEMOCRAT FEAR MONGERING:

These changes are meant to slash Medicaid and gut funding.

FACT:
The BBB doesn’t slash Medicaid—it strengthens it.

By removing ineligible individuals and focusing resources on those truly in need, the reforms ensure long-term sustainability of the program.

Medicaid spending is projected to grow under the BBB, not shrink, because the focus is on integrity and efficiency—not cuts.

⸻

Bottom Line:
The BBB reforms don’t weaken Medicaid—they preserve it for those who need it most: vulnerable seniors, low-income children, people with disabilities, and legal working families.

'1924855443739873660',"I and our Republican Conference had the opportunity to spend over 90 minutes with President Donald Trump this morning. President Trump was absolutely inspiring, always witty, and emphasized the importance of passing what he has named the Big Beautiful Bill. 

The bill is a plan, a framework with initiatives for national security, economic strength, and in fact, world stability. This bill will secure the border even further through legislation so it cannot be overturned in the future. It will make us energy dominant again, will restore our military, and make our American economy the most competitive in the world. 

But in the same note, I believe this reconciliation bill is only the beginning—when it’s done, it will only be five to six months into the President’s four year term. This bill will serve as a spring board to create the strongest economy, bring down our out of control deficit spending, and bring stability to the world. 

We must pass it. It’s not “perfect,” but it’s the beginning as we carry out the America First agenda and continue the pursuit of happiness and a more perfect union for all Americans.

'1922340722449031521',"The Trump Administration is revitalizing the financial services industry with a clear focus on pro-growth, pro-investment, and pro-American policies:

 ✅ Regulations are being streamlined to make 
         American businesses more competitive
 ✅ Basel III is being reconsidered in a capital neutral 
         way. 
 ✅ Debanking is being eliminated.
 ✅ Access to capital is expanding.
 ✅ Energy and borrowing costs are down.
 ✅ Tariffs are improving access to new, foreign 
         markets. 
 ✅ Key Trump Administration regulators like Travis 
         Hill, Jonathan Gould, Paul Atkins, and Michelle 
         Bowman are advocating for clear, bright-line, pro- 
         growth rules.
 ✅ Going public is becoming affordable again and 
          the number of IPOs is already increasing

Once Budget Reconciliation is complete, we’ll add tax certainty, expand domestic energy production, and strengthen fiscal discipline—key indicators to investors that will encourage long-term investment in the United States. The results speak for themselves: $5 trillion in new investment—foreign and domestic—has already been committed, and we’re just getting started.

This is pro-growth supply-side economics in action: lower costs, lower inflation, and increased capital investment. April’s CPI came in at just 2.3%, the lowest since Q1 2021—a clear sign we’re headed in the right direction.

The Biden administration used excessive government spending to drive demand; President @realDonaldTrump is attracting investment to drive supply growth, meet demand, and lower inflation. The Federal Reserve and media reporting on our economy should understand attracting investment dollars and rebalancing trade doesn’t drive demand, it rebalances the economy, grows supply, lowers inflation, and should lower interest rates. President Trump understands this.

'1921955754690437250',"President @realDonaldTrump's executive order on prescription drug prices is a major step toward finally bringing fairness to American patients and taxpayers. For too long, Americans have paid far more than those in other countries for the same prescription drugs. In Europe, for example, patients often pay a tenth of what we pay here in the United States. President Trump and his Administration are taking action to change that.
 
Once again, President Trump is showing that his only special interest is the American people—and that’s mine too. By tying what we pay in the U.S. to the lowest prices paid abroad, this executive order is expected to reduce drug costs by as much as 59%. That means real relief for seniors and families across the country.

'1912630023283982641',"Immediately following the attack, I reached out privately to the Governor to express my relief that he and his family were safe and publicly condemned the attack. No matter our political differences, there is no place for violence of any kind in our society.
 
The individual in custody is clearly deranged and solely responsible for his actions — a reporter mischaracterized my comments.
 
What I said in a recent interview—and what I meant—is that the broader political rhetoric we’re seeing from both sides is dangerous. There have been two assassination attempts on President Trump. There have been violent attacks on Tesla dealerships. That doesn’t happen in a vacuum.
 
What frustrates me is when leaders make outrageous, false claims—like the Governor stating President Trump’s policies would make Pennsylvanians go hungry. We now know his claims were entirely inaccurate, and the PA Department of Agriculture has millions of federal dollars to continue supporting food banks. That kind of rhetoric is reckless. When people hear things like that—just like when political opponents are labeled ‘fascists’ or ‘Nazis’—it fuels hatred—especially when it is not condemned by political leaders. And hatred can lead to violence.

'1912226326586466494',"On Tax Day, we’re reminded of the real risk American families face if Congress fails to extend President @realDonaldTrump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

Passed in 2017, the TCJA delivered the largest middle-class tax cut in U.S. history, reduced taxes for the lowest-income Americans by 10%, and drove the fastest two-year growth in real wages in two decades—all while helping lower wealth inequality.

If Congress allows these tax cuts to expire, a family of four in Pennsylvania will be forced to pay an additional $1,491 in taxes each year.

Additionally, small businesses would benefit by the extension of several provisions, like 100% bonus depreciation and the section 199A small business deduction, which would allow for greater reinvestment and growth for these businesses.

'1902452107405402303',"🚨Egg Prices & Avian Flu: What You Need to Know🚨 

In November, egg prices began to climb due to the avian flu, which led to the loss of 160 million egg-laying hens during the course of the outbreak. The Biden Administration did little to combat the avian flu, and the drastic reduction in supply drove prices to record highs, hitting upwards of $8 per dozen. However, in early March, prices began to steadily decline.

This crisis put a tremendous strain on both consumers and America’s poultry farmers, who I have remained in contact with since the onset of the outbreak. Over the past two months, the Trump Administration’s USDA has taken decisive action, launching a serious plan to combat avian flu. This includes:

✅Strengthening biosecurity measures

✅Providing financial relief to affected farmers

✅Investing in vaccine development to prevent future outbreaks

I have been in direct contact with USDA @SecRollins several times to discuss the matter, and I feel highly assured that she and her office have put together a plan that will resolve this situation as quickly as possible. Secretary Rollins is discussing the issue with poultry farms across the country and in Pennsylvania to hear about the challenges they’re facing and about their ideas to address the current and future outbreaks. As I’ve said many times before, the Trump Administration is not about throwing money at a problem, but rather about solving the problem in the short-term and in the long-term—positive results for the American people are all that matter to President @realDonaldTrump and his Administration.",en,Tweet,2,10,3,7,1258,2025-03-19 20:08:22,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1897143662598926356',"Congressman Dan Meuser (PA-09) released the following statement in response to President Donald J. Trump's address to the Joint Session of Congress:

“Tonight, President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to the Renewal of the American Dream and made clear that Promises Made, Promises Kept is not just a slogan—it’s a reality. After four years of failed policies, soaring inflation, open borders, and global instability under Biden, we now have a President focused on securing our nation, restoring prosperity, and ensuring every American has the opportunity to achieve success. While many Democrats resorted to political theatrics and an inexcusable lack of basic decorum—resulting in one member being thrown out—President Trump stayed focused on the issues that matter—delivering results for the American people. The American Dream is back within reach, and with strong leadership, government can work for the people, not against them.

""Since taking office, President Trump has delivered historic results. Unlawful border crossings are down 93%, with February marking the lowest number of illegal crossings in recorded history. By reinstating Remain in Mexico, restarting border wall construction, and ending catch-and-release, he is stopping the crisis the left created. These policies aren’t just securing the border—they are saving lives by cracking down on human trafficking and drug smuggling. Fentanyl and other deadly drugs are no longer flowing freely across our borders, and criminals who exploit our broken immigration system are being held accountable. America is safer, crime is dropping, and the cartels are finally being treated like the terrorist organizations they are.

""President Trump is also unleashing American energy, lifting Biden’s disastrous LNG export ban, reopening drilling, and cutting job-killing regulations. Pennsylvania will be at the forefront of this energy resurgence, lowering costs for working families and ensuring we never rely on foreign adversaries for energy again. At the same time, he is restoring fiscal responsibility, and in just over a month, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has already saved taxpayers $105 billion by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government—delivering real accountability where others have only made empty promises.

""On the world stage, America is once again respected. President Trump has reimposed a maximum pressure campaign on Iran, curbed China’s growing influence, and demanded our neighbors take action to help secure our border. The days of Biden’s weak foreign policy and endless appeasement are over—peace through strength has returned.

""At home, we are bringing back common sense to government. Parents should have a voice in their children’s education and medical decisions. School choice must be the standard, not the exception. DEI-driven bureaucracy has no place in our institutions. Criminals should face real consequences, not be given a free pass. And perhaps most novel of all, government should follow the Constitution—starting with protecting free speech and upholding the First Amendment. While Democrats claim they are fighting for democracy, the reality is they are fighting for bureaucracy—more control, more mandates, and more government overreach. 

""His pro-growth economic policies have already attracted trillions of dollars in new investment from private companies and foreign governments, reinforcing confidence in America’s future. House Republicans stand with President Trump and are committed to advancing the America First agenda that voters sent us here to deliver. I look forward to working alongside the President to continue rebuilding our economy, securing our border, and ensuring America’s best days are ahead.""",en,Tweet,12,262,31,33,27878,2025-03-05 04:34:31,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1895527857452958020',"🚨 @FinancialCmte Republicans Are Fighting Back Against Biden's Overdraft Rule 🚨

The CFPB overstepped its authority with its Biden-Era rule capping overdraft fees. While the rule claims to apply only to large banks, the real impact will hit community banks & consumers hardest.

❌ Higher costs for consumers – With fewer revenue sources, community banks may be forced to raise account fees, increase minimum balance requirements, or limit low-cost banking options. This could push more Americans out of the banking system, not help them.

❌ Unfair market pressure on small banks – Large banks may lower their overdraft fees to the CFPB’s arbitrary $5 benchmark, forcing smaller banks to follow suit or risk losing customers. Unlike big banks, community banks can’t absorb these losses, leading to reduced services and even bank closures. This rule would lead to consolidation and places community banks at a disadvantage.

❌ A blow to financial inclusion – Millions of Americans rely on overdraft protection to cover emergency expenses. If banks eliminate or restrict overdraft services, many consumers will have fewer options and be forced toward riskier alternatives.

🚨 This rule isn’t about protecting consumers—it’s about scoring cheap political points at the expense of Americans. In reality, it will make banking more expensive and less accessible for working families. If the Biden Administration did their homework and spoke to constituents, they'd know this rule is out of touch.

That’s why Republicans are pushing a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn this harmful regulation. We’re fighting to protect community banks, preserve consumer choice, and ensure Americans have access to the financial tools they need. Read the legislation below:

Enjoy this Presidents’ Day as it is an exclusively American day, during which we honor the presidency, the Constitution, and the Separation of Powers, laid out in Article I, Article II, and Article III. The Executive Powers are established by Article II. Followed and enforced by the father of our country, George Washington, while president, forbade anyone from ever referring to him as anything more than Mr. President — there were no “your highnesses” within earshot of George Washington. There were many predictions around the world that our first president George Washington would not leave the office, but he did quite willingly, quite voluntarily, while his countryman pleaded with him to remain. We have a great country and great people. We are a lasting constitutional republic… “If we can keep it,” in the words of Benjamin Franklin, a great Founding Father and Pennsylvanian. Washington, and thankfully, all of our Founders, were completely determined to form a government by the people and for the people. There is a desire today, probably has always been by some, to change so that we have a government that rules the people… this will not stand in America. The people will rule the government… that’s America. Let’s all resolve to do our part for our families and for all American families to keep America… America.

'1890140799104610687',"Governor Shapiro’s lawsuit against the Trump administration is an attempt not to resolve the unaccountable spending of the Biden-Harris administration but to exploit it. The Trump Administration’s funding pause is entirely legal and an absolutely necessary action to ensure taxpayer dollars serve America’s real priorities—not the left’s extreme agenda.

This isn’t a cut, or politics; it’s a common sense pause to review how huge levels of taxpayers’ dollars are being spent. President @realDonaldTrump has every right to ensure these funds go where they were intended to be allocated, not to the waste and misdirection we have seen in recent days such as the $59 million to luxury hotels housing illegals in New York City.

The American people elected accountability, and some in Washington and the Governor’s office don’t like that. They’d rather keep the status quo than have anyone question where the money is going. President Trump is doing exactly what voters asked for—ensuring federal funds are spent wisely and that taxpayer dollars aren't being mismanaged or wasted.

If Shapiro actually wanted to fix the problem, he’d work with the administration to ensure these funds are spent properly—instead, he’s running to the courts for a political stunt.",en,Tweet,1,48,14,9,2631,2025-02-13 20:47:38,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1884970676768866351',"We are all deeply saddened by the tragic mid-air collision last night near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, involving an American Airlines flight from Wichita and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter. This devastating accident resulted in the expected loss of all passengers and crew members on both aircraft.

Among those lost were U.S. Army pilots and members of the U.S. figure skating team, along with their families and coaches, who were returning home from a competition. As we learn more about this heartbreaking event, it is evident how profound this loss is for so many communities.

I extend my deepest condolences to the families who have lost loved ones. Our thoughts and prayers are with them this morning—prayers for the families of the passengers and soldiers, for all who were on board, and for the brave, hard-working first responders who spent the night in rescue and recovery efforts.

Preliminary reports indicate that both the helicopter and airplane were operating on standard aviation paths, suggesting this was a terrible accident.

As my good friend and colleague Rep. Ron Estes said, “it is a real tragedy.” I am thankful to hear that the Kansas Congressional delegation is safe.

There will be discussions about improving and modernizing our transportation system to prevent future tragedies as air travel becomes more congested, but today is not that day. Today, we pray for the victims, their families, and all those affected. When the time comes, I look forward to working with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to bring our transportation system into the 21st century.

'1875280793737519174',"President Biden’s decision to block the $14.9 billion U.S. Steel-Nippon Steel deal is a massive blow to Pennsylvania steelworkers and our nation’s future in steel production. This merger would have secured thousands of jobs and created thousands more, brought cutting-edge technology, and positioned U.S. Steel as a global leader—all without outsourcing jobs.

Instead, Biden is ignoring the will of workers, catering to union bosses and confusing allies like Japan with adversaries like China. Generational steelworkers in Pennsylvania and the American people deserve better. My only request is that President Trump brings his great business mind and expertise to ensure this deal benefits Pennsylvania and strengthens our national security.",en,Tweet,3,16,5,4,2265,2025-01-03 20:39:16,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1875280659008069632/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/uA968kzwKrCKztMB.mp4?tag=12
'1875233281488384249',"President Biden’s decision to block the U.S. Steel-Nippon Steel Deal is a significant blow to Pennsylvania and the American steel industry. This $14.9 billion investment would have made U.S. Steel the largest producer in America, created nearly 6,000 new jobs, and modernized plants with $2.7 billion in cutting-edge upgrades—all while keeping production in Pennsylvania. Japan is a trusted ally, not an adversary like China.

Our hope and expectation is President Trump will step in, review this investment in a business-minded way as only he can, and hopefully save U.S. Steel while making it better for America. Revitalizing industries, securing jobs, and protecting American workers is his specialty, and much of Pennsylvania’s steel manufacturing future is at stake. We hope President Trump can save U.S. Steel for the second time and have Japan pay for it.

'1874920319166615895',"President Biden’s decision to award members of the January 6th Committee the second-highest civilian medal is an affront to the truth and to the American people. The January 6th Committee was a sham—a kangaroo court with a predetermined outcome: find President Trump guilty. They blocked Republican members from joining the committee who would have sought fairness, proving it was never about uncovering the truth but about advancing a partisan agenda at the expense of taxpayers.
 
On January 6th, Speaker Nancy Pelosi admitted on camera that she was “responsible” for the security failures, including her refusal to call for the National Guard despite serious warnings. Yet, the committee ignored these facts entirely. Instead, they withheld or deleted crucial records, failing to archive more than a terabyte of data—equivalent to 6.5 million pages of documents—and destroyed video recordings of witness interviews, which is against House Rules, while selectively editing clips for public hearings that fit their narrative. This charade wasted taxpayer dollars and obstructed genuine efforts to understand and address the failures of that day.
 
Giving an award to the architects of this farce insults the American people and undermines justice. Anyone accepting this so-called recognition becomes part of the charade. This fits a disturbing pattern from this administration—pardoning felon family members, excusing corrupt deals, and now rewarding political theater. Americans deserve better than this disgraceful spectacle.

'1846970484812140791',"Israel stands as a beacon of democracy in the Middle East, and the United States and our European Allies must support their efforts to root out terror as they face mounting threats from neighboring countries. French President Emmanuel Macron’s public call for an arms embargo on Israel and the Biden-Harris Administration’s threat to call for the same is dangerous and reckless. This will only embolden Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran. 

Kamala Harris and the anti-Israel left continue to say they will support Israel’s right to defend itself, yet never do they say they support Israel’s right to defeat its enemies, even as its enemies continue to seek the annihilation of Israel from the river to the sea. 

Rather than a completely ineffective strategy of appeasement, this administration, France, and other allies should be coalescing behind Israel and making it clear to Iran that nothing will be taken off the table, including attacks on its nuclear facilities, if it does not cease its terrorist activities.

'1846593996107440385',"The Biden-Harris administration, the FBI, and their media allies have engaged in a calculated effort to deceive the public for political gain. In September 2023, the FBI boasted a 2.1% drop in violent crime for 2022, only to quietly revise the data recently, revealing that violent crime actually spiked by 4.5%, accounting for thousands more murders, rapes, robberies, and assaults. This blatant manipulation of the facts by Democrats and the media has potentially put American lives in danger by falsely leading them to believe they are safe—especially hardworking Pennsylvanians—who face the consequences of the crime crisis every day.

'1843286388461985875',"Today marks the solemn one-year anniversary of Hamas' barbaric attack on Israel, which claimed the lives of 1,200 innocent people. This unprovoked act of terror reminds us of the ongoing threats Israel faces on many fronts, and we continue to stand in unwavering solidarity with our closest ally in the Middle East.
 
Israel has every right to defend itself, and the United States must fully support their efforts to eliminate Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iranian-backed proxies, all menaces to the region. The release of hostages remains a top priority, and the world should recognize the incredible courage and resilience of the Israeli people.
 
As we reflect on this tragedy, we also have to redouble our efforts to combat the rise of anti-Semitism around the world. Hatred and violence against the Jewish people have no place in any society, and we need to work together to put an end to these dangerous ideologies.
 
Our prayers remain with the victims and their families.
