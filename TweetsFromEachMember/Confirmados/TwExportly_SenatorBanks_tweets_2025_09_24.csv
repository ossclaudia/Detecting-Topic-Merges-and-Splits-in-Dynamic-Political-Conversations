Here in Indiana, Republicans cannot afford to stand idly by while our conservative values are sidelined. I stand firmly with President Trump’s bold call to redraw Indiana’s congressional map to ensure fair representation that truly reflects the will of Hoosier voters. 

Our state is a stronghold of conservative principles: hard work, faith, family, and freedom and it’s time our congressional delegation further amplifies that voice in Washington. 

Redrawing the map isn’t just about politics. It’s about restoring fairness and giving Hoosiers the strong, unapologetic representation they deserve to counter the radical policies pushed by the Far Left nationwide.
