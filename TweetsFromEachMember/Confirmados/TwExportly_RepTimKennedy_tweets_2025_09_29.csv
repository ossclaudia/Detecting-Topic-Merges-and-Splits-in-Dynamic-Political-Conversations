'1970508962450551111',"Once again, this administration is undermining scientific credibility and eroding public trust. Suggesting a link between Tylenol and autism, without credible evidence, spreads fear instead of facts. Reckless statements from the President and RFK Jr. that ignore established science only create confusion for families.

'1950198550723190994',"The murder of a brave NYPD officer and several innocent civilians in Midtown Manhattan is tragic and horrifying. We mourn their loss and stand with their loved ones and all those affected by this senseless act of violence.

We owe our deepest gratitude to the first responders who acted swiftly and selflessly to prevent an even greater loss of life.

This mass shooting is a devastating reminder that the epidemic of gun violence continues to plague our nation. The fact that a gunman crossed the country to carry out mass murder, despite a documented history of mental health crises, should alarm every one of us.

We cannot accept this as normal. We must confront the dangerous intersection of mental illness and easy access to deadly weapons. We are long overdue for stronger gun laws at the federal level and Congress has a responsibility to act.

New Yorkers are resilient, but they deserve more than thoughts and prayers. They deserve solutions.

For Secretary McMahon to say that yesterday’s court ruling was a “win for students and families” is an insult to public education and educators across the country.

This is about more than just education — it’s about the dangerous erosion of checks and balances in our democracy. We cannot, and will not, sit back while this administration tears down the institutions meant to serve the American student and families.

Today, I’m proud to recognize Tyler Feliciano, Front Desk Lead at @nhcwny.

Tyler’s story is one of resilience and leadership. As a first-generation high school and college graduate, Tyler grew up helping his family navigate the complexities of healthcare. That experience drives his work at the Neighborhood Health Center, where he goes above and beyond to help patients every day.

Recently, when a patient preparing for surgery showed up with inactive insurance, Tyler didn’t miss a beat. He got her enrolled so she could still be seen, and then followed up the same day to resolve any issues before her surgery. That’s not just customer service, it’s care in action!

Thank you, Tyler, for leading with heart and showing what it truly means to serve others. Tyler represents what the City of Good Neighbors and the Neighborhood Health Center are all about.
