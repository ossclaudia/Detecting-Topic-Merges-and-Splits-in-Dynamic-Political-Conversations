'1957083812199821329',"Last weekend, I visited Israel, including the West Bank and the Gaza border, to see the situation for myself and to speak directly with leaders there, including the head of the UN World Food Program, Palestinian Prime Minister Muhammad Mustafa, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, and senior intelligence officials. The history and politics of the region are complicated, but a few things are clear to me: 

First, there is a severe and undeniable humanitarian crisis in Gaza. More food is now entering Gaza, but it still is not getting to those who need it most. I am demanding that the UN and Israeli government jointly develop an aggressive operation to surge aid to innocent civilians. I pressed President Herzog on this issue, making clear that it is both a moral and a strategic imperative. 

Second, there can be no lasting peace for either Israelis or Palestinians so long as Iran continues to arm and finance terrorist proxies like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. Hamas is inflicting unimaginable suffering in the region–torturing hostages, depriving innocent Gazans of basic needs, terrorizing Israelis, and unnecessarily prolonging the war that it started on October 7. Hamas needs to release the hostages, surrender its arms, and cede control to leaders who put the Palestinian people ahead of the Iranian regime.  

Third, I appreciate that so many of you feel so passionately about the war.  As a dad to two little kids, it’s heartbreaking to see images from this war where so many children–Israeli and Palestinian–are caught in the middle. As Upstate New Yorkers, I hope we can give each other the benefit of the doubt and start from our shared values, knowing that we all want the suffering to end and none of us supports violence against anyone because of how they worship.
