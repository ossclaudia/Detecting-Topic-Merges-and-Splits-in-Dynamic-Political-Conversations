'1968747294691557838',"The world has a moral and legal obligation to call atrocities by their name. What is happening in Gaza is genocide.

The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide criminalizes acts committed with the intention to destroy a group in whole or in part. Leading experts and human rights organizations—Israeli, Palestinian, and international alike—continue to conclude that Israel’s actions in Gaza meet that legal threshold.

That conclusion is now reinforced by the determination of a United Nations Commission of Inquiry. Its findings are clear: Prime Minister Netanyahu must end his military operations and policy of starvation in Gaza. All states are obligated to take action to bring the genocide to an end.

As Co-Chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, I have long argued that U.S. foreign policy must be grounded in international law and the defense of human dignity. Our country cannot turn a blind eye to such blatant violations of these principles. Nor can we continue to arm and fund a government engaged in such crimes.

https://t.co/gsvpLO3u0O

As horrifying as this is, it’s not surprising. Under his government, cruelty is a policy objective. Why? Because the extreme right wants to push Palestinians off of their land so settlers can move to Gaza and annex the West Bank.
 
In the West Bank, settlers and soldiers have killed hundreds of civilians—including Americans—since October 7. Both our government and Netanyahu’s refuse to punish perpetrators, so the families of people like Saif Musallet and Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi rarely see the justice they deserve.

In Gaza, the strategies of dispossession include hunger, thirst, disease, bullets, and bombs. Yesterday, at least 81 people were killed. 31 of them were seeking food aid. 15 starved to death. This has become a disturbingly common occurrence.  
 
Now, Netanyahu’s government is clearing the way to imprison 600,000 Gazans in a tiny strip of land in Rafah. Scholars of international law tell us this is patently illegal and immoral.

'1890436412131906047',"It’s a lie to say that Dems are “fighting for” waste, fraud, and abuse. Every single tax dollar ought to be spent efficiently and wisely. Nobody is debating that. Here’s what we are debating:

1) Elon keeps crying ""waste"" but it's really just things he doesn’t like.
 
2) We don't live in a dictatorship. The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. Republicans have a majority in both Houses. Congress—which is elected by you, the people, to do this job—should debate these ideas and pass them into law in full daylight and transparency. The way Elon is doing things is sketchy and unconstitutional.

3) Why did Elon and Trump fire all the independent, nonpartisan Inspectors General who investigate and shut down waste, fraud and abuse?
 
4) And on that note, why didn’t they start by sending DOGE to the Pentagon, which is the *biggest* part of discretionary federal spending, and has never passed an audit? Instead they chose to dismantle an agency that passed an audit three months ago…

5) It appears Elon gets a lot of money from Pentagon contracts. Is he acting corruptly? Does he have a conflict of interest?

6) We can’t be sure, because he’s not filing a financial disclosure form like every other senior official has to do! Where’s the transparency?
 
6) His focus is on cutting programs that help people—instead of talking about why so many billionaires don’t pay what they owe in taxes. Maybe we wouldn't have to cut so much if big corporations just paid their taxes? Would be a great debate to have in Congress!

'1854279565507731605',"My statement in response to the outcome of the 2024 presidential election:

Donald Trump has won. A majority of people voted for him. I am sad and deeply concerned that he will be our next president.

You can’t love your country only when you win—and I commend Vice President Kamala Harris for conceding the race with decency and class, unlike Donald Trump who tried to overturn the election four years ago when he lost, and who planned to call it rigged again if the results didn’t go his way.

Look, this is a painful and disappointing outcome. Like so many of you, I’m worried. Worried about what this means for the future. Worried for the most vulnerable among us. Worried for our democracy. Worried that people will give up and unplug from politics for the next four years because of how hard this is. But I’m asking—please don’t give in to despair. We cannot go back, only forward—and the hard work of protecting America from the most devastating impacts of a second Donald Trump presidency begins today.

Democrats are not defeated. We know what to fight for because we know what we stand for. An economy that works for working people. A government that respects everyone. A positive vision for a better future where we address big problems like climate change, hunger, and poverty. We will work day and night to highlight the sharp contrast between our hopeful vision for the future, and Donald Trump’s dark desire to drag us back.

Let me end with this. The beauty of democracy is that no defeat is final—we will continue to fight for our values and push for progress. Where Democrats can find common ground, we will work together to get things done. Where we cannot, we will stand up for what we believe. The work goes on, and I pledge to fight on behalf of all who stake their hopes and dreams on our success.",en,Tweet,9,309,59,71,18615,2024-11-06 21:47:53,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

The only problem? Trump already had a chance and he did the opposite.

➡️ He weakened Clean Water Act protections, dismantled air pollution standards, and stalled or reversed bans on toxic chemicals like chlorpyrifos and perchlorate—both linked to serious health risks, including developmental issues in children.

➡️ He appointed corporate insiders and lobbyists to oversee our environmental and chemical laws, undermining our watchdog agencies by turning them into extensions of the industries they were meant to regulate.

➡️ He picked a Big Pharma executive to run the FDA, a coal insider to oversee the EPA, and an oil lobbyist to oversee conserving our natural resources.

➡️ He pressured regulators to cover up evidence of the dangers posed by toxic chemicals, according to new allegations by whistleblowers.

➡️ He consistently favored Big Ag, and hurt small farmers by undermining rural development and prioritizing massive industrial farms that could care less about toxic pesticides in our food.
