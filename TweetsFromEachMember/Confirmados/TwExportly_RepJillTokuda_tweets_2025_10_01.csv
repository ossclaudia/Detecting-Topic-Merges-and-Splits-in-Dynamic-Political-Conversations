""It's been sickening to see Republicans fast track a bill that's not just bad policy, it's reckless and selfish, and it's a betrayal to our people. 

This bill would rip lifesaving Medicaid coverage from 17 million Americans, including 150,000 in Hawai‘i, and take food out of the mouths of 42 million people who rely on SNAP to feed their families, including 22,000 right here at home. 

It guts the income our farmers and grocers depend on to nourish our communities, all while handing billions in tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy. 

These aren’t handouts, they’re lifelines. 

And the cruelest part? Our keiki will be stuck paying off the $5 trillion in debt this bill creates.

To push this through on the eve of our nation’s birthday isn’t just heartless — it’s anti-American. It’s wrong, and Hawai‘i and our country deserves better. 

While we lost the battle on this bill today, I will never stop fighting against the war Republicans have waged on our people and the safety nets and lifelines that help to lift our families up.
