Violence and intimidation have no place in our democracy. Not now. Not ever. 

In this defining moment, we are called to rise above division—to speak with respect, listen with empathy, and show the world that unity does not demand uniformity.

This is not an isolated incident—it’s a glimpse of how our adversaries operate inside our borders and against our democracy.

We’re breaking down silos, rewriting outdated laws, accelerating next-gen capabilities, and giving our intelligence professionals the tools to dismantle hostile networks before they can act.

'1969087826714124757',"Each week, we celebrate neighbors from across our district, whose dedication and service make our community such a special place to call home. Today, we honor a man who has devoted his life to protecting and strengthening Newtown Township. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero— Fire Chief Glenn Forsyth.
 
Chief Forsyth’s story is woven into the fabric of Newtown itself. A lifelong resident, he grew up in a family where fire service wasn’t just a duty — it was a tradition. His grandfather joined the Newtown Fire Association in 1915, his father and uncles followed, and in 1975, Glenn followed their footsteps, stepping up to become a junior firefighter. From that day forward, service wasn’t something he did; it became who he is.
 
Over the past five decades, he rose through the ranks of the Newtown Fire Association, serving as president, trustee, battalion chief, and safety officer, before being appointed in 2012 as Newtown Township’s first full-time fire chief, entrusted with leading and modernizing the department. Along the way, he mentored generations of firefighters and helped transform the department into the cornerstone of public safety it is today. This year marks not only his 50th year with the Newtown Fire Association but also his 47th year of service to Newtown Township, including 28 years with the police department. Through it all, he has been the very definition of a hometown public servant--dependable, humble, and devoted to his neighbors.
 
Through every chapter of his career, Chief Forsyth has been a steady presence—on the scene of emergencies, at community events, and behind the scenes, quietly improving safety, training, and preparedness. He has spent his life making his neighbors safer, his community stronger, and the Fire Association ready to serve the next generation.
 
Chief Forsyth’s career is more than a record of service—it’s a testament to his remarkable character. Please join me in thanking Chief Forsyth for 50 years of selfless service, leadership, and dedication to our community. Chief, we congratulate you on this incredible milestone and are proud to call you a true hometown hero!",en,Tweet,0,5,0,4,1117,2025-09-19 18:14:56,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1Oa5zTWoAIylOk.jpg

Since the UK passed its flawed Troubles bill in 2023, I’ve worked with victims, families, and leaders in London, Dublin, Belfast, and here at home to help forge a path forward rooted in truth, accountability, and the rule of law.

This new framework is more than a course correction—it is a decisive step toward fulfilling the promise of the Good Friday Agreement, reopening investigations closed under the old act, reinforcing independent oversight, and most importantly, placing the victims and families back at the heart of the process.

This work reaches far beyond Northern Ireland. It speaks to our shared heritage, strengthens transatlantic ties, and offers a beacon of hope for divided societies everywhere. I will continue working with victims, families, leaders, and my colleagues in Congress to see this framework fully enacted and implemented.

Today, we honor a man whose courage and quick action saved a life. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero—Dr. John Sampson of Warwick Township.
 
Dr. Sampson is well known here at home as the owner of the Richboro Veterinary Hospital, where he’s saved countless pets and provided care and comfort to families throughout our community. But over Labor Day Weekend, he became a hero of a different kind.
 
When a child made his way onto a sky-high monorail track, shocked visitors looked on from below as his frantic parents searched the crowd. Dr. Sampson, a father of three, jumped into action—climbing a fence to reach the roof of a nearby building, stepping onto the track himself, and carrying the frightened boy to safety.
 
He may have described himself as just a guy in the right place at the right time, but to the boy he saved, his family, and all of us here in Bucks County, he is much more. His actions weren’t an accident of circumstance—they were the instinct of a man who has built his life around care and service. As a veterinarian, business owner, and community member, he has devoted himself to healing and strengthening the bonds between families and their beloved pets. That same compassion is exactly what he brought to that moment on the monorail track.
 
Heroism isn’t reserved for a few—it’s found in the everyday decisions we make to protect and care for one another. Dr. Sampson’s example calls on each of us to act when someone is in need and reminds us we are at our best when we show up for one another.

Iryna Zarutska fled war in Ukraine seeking the promise of safety and opportunity in America. She deserved both. Instead, at just 23, she was brutally murdered on her way home from work in Charlotte.

Our first duty as a society is to protect the innocent. But when our justice system lets repeat violent offenders slip through without consequences and leaves serious mental illness untreated, it fails all of us, and it cost Iryna her life.

We owe it to her, and to everyone, to come together at every level to close the gaps in the system, strengthen law enforcement, and confront untreated mental illness before it costs more lives. This isn’t about politics, it’s about the most basic promise any society can make to its people: that they will be safe.

Working alongside the indomitable Ellen Saracini, I authored the Saracini Aviation Safety Act, signed into law in 2018, to require secondary cockpit barriers on all new commercial aircraft, and the Saracini Enhanced Aviation Safety Act, signed into law last year, to retrofit the entire fleet.

These laws, named in honor of Ellen’s husband, Captain Victor Saracini of Bucks County, whom we lost on 9/11, are the direct result of years of her tireless advocacy and our work together to turn grief into action and safeguard the future.

From the day they take office, all elected officials must commit to serving the public—not themselves.  

The Restore Trust in Congress Act is a bipartisan bill to ban Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependents from owning or trading individual stocks.

Because when lawmakers can profit off the industries they regulate, it isn’t just wrong, it erodes democracy itself.

I’ve led this fight every single Congress—from Day One. I’m proud to stand with @RepAOC, @RepChipRoy, @RepJayapal, @RepTimBurchett, @Rep_Magaziner—a coalition as broad as the public demand for reform.

'1961493314227560719',"Each week, we share stories from across our district of neighbors whose courage, character, and quiet acts of service remind us what makes Bucks County such a special place to call home. Today, we honor a woman whose ordinary workday became an extraordinary act of heroism. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero, Sarah Van de Laar of Bensalem.
 
Sarah has spent the past six years serving our community as a @USPS letter carrier. Like so many of her colleagues, she is a familiar, steady presence in the lives of those along her route—someone neighbors count on day in and day out.
 
But one afternoon on Knights Road, Sarah’s route became anything but routine. She saw a car veer off the curb and crash, and in that moment, she didn’t think twice. She stopped, ran to the scene, and found the driver slumped over in his seat. She immediately called 911, pulled him from the vehicle with the help of a passerby, and began CPR. Calm, steady, and determined, she kept going until first responders arrived. Only later did she learn that her quick action had saved his life. And weeks later, when she saw him again face to face, she described that moment simply as “a gift.”
 
In her own words, Sarah doesn’t see herself as a hero: “I just consider myself a human being. I come into my job every day, go home, and see my family.” That’s who she is—humble, steady, devoted to her work and her community.  She reminds us that true heroism often comes from ordinary people who act with extraordinary courage when it matters most.
 
Our letter carriers don’t just deliver mail—they deliver trust, connection, and care. They are often the first to notice when something is wrong, the ones who look out for our seniors, and the steady presence that keeps our communities connected day after day. Yet too often, their service is taken for granted. That is why I have made it a top priority to partner with our local carriers and advocates across the nation to ensure their voices are heard. Together, we’ve fought to strengthen the Postal Service, secure fair treatment, and deliver the resources they need to keep doing their jobs with pride. Sarah’s courage is a reminder of the extraordinary humanity at the heart of this work—and why I will always stand shoulder to shoulder with our postal workers, here at home and across America.

At just 40 years old, he was taken from us by the wounds he sustained in Afghanistan while serving with the 82nd Airborne. Gravely injured by an IED in 2010, Mike endured more than 120 surgeries and years of unimaginable pain—but he refused to be broken. With his wife and high school sweetheart, Sarah, by his side, he turned sacrifice into service: lifting up his fellow warriors, leading in his community, and launching the Independence Fund’s Trackchair program, which restored freedom and dignity to thousands of America’s wounded veterans.

Mike’s story reminds us that the price of freedom is not abstract. It is written in the scars of our warriors and in the unshakable strength of their families. It is borne every day by those who serve and by those who love them.

Michael Verardo was a faithful servant. A patriot. A hero.

I’ve sat with educators across our district, and they’ve all voiced a common truth: while we invest heavily in preparing new teachers, we don’t do enough to support the growth of those already in the classroom.

With their feedback and partnership, we created the Teachers Are Leaders Act—legislation that builds leadership pathways for veteran educators to mentor colleagues, shape curriculum, and strengthen school communities.

From securing the full five-year Head Start renewal to unlocking billions in education funds, my mission has always been clear: invest in children, empower teachers, and strengthen schools.

The Teachers Are Leaders Act continues that effort—giving experienced educators the opportunity to lead, grow, and inspire the next generation of leaders.

Today, we shine a light on one of our own who has risen to the very top of his field while never forgetting where he came from. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero, Robert “Bob” Costa of Lower Makefield.
 
Bob has just been named this year’s recipient of the National Press Club’s prestigious Fourth Estate Award—the highest honor in American journalism. It is reserved for those whose work has changed the way we understand our democracy and the institutions that shape it. And now, alongside legends like Walter Cronkite, Andrea Mitchell, and Tom Brokaw, stands a proud graduate of Pennsbury High School.
 
From editing the school paper and serving as senior class president, even landing John Mayer to play the senior prom, to covering music for the Bucks County Courier Times and interning with my late brother, Mike Fitzpatrick, Bob’s story has always been rooted here at home. He went on to the Washington Post, co-authored a best-selling book with Bob Woodward, and today serves as a national correspondent for CBS Sunday Morning and chief Washington analyst for CBS News.
 
But what makes this honor so meaningful is not only Bob’s remarkable career, but how he’s carried Bucks County with him every step of the way. Growing up here, surrounded by neighbors with so many different perspectives, taught him to listen first. As he’s said: “People can, in good faith, have different perspectives. You have to listen to your neighbor and not expect that everyone has the same view.” I share that belief. It’s at the heart of who we are in Bucks County: disagreement does not have to mean division, and listening is the foundation of both democracy and community.
 
From Pennsbury’s classrooms to the halls of CBS News, Bob has carried that spirit with him—and today, the nation honors it with journalism’s highest prize.

Fentanyl is not a distant problem—it is the crisis of our time. It is now the leading cause of death for young Americans, often hidden in counterfeit pills that look safe but contain a fatal dose.

➡️ Just one pill can kill.

Behind every life lost is a story unfinished—a son or daughter, a classmate, a teammate, a friend. Each tragedy leaves a family shattered and a community forever changed.

As Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health & Substance Use Disorder Task Force, I am continuing my work to change that by:

✅ Driving nationwide prevention efforts to educate teens and families and cut through the silence and stigma
✅ Forging partnerships with schools, healthcare providers, and law enforcement so communities are equipped to act
✅ Delivering federal resources to expand treatment, recovery, and life-saving tools for families on the frontlines
✅ Advancing bipartisan legislation to crack down on counterfeit pills, hold traffickers accountable, expand prevention, and save lives

But prevention must also begin at home:

🛑 Talk openly about the dangers of fentanyl and counterfeit pills
🛑 Never share or take someone else’s medication
🛑 Store prescriptions securely and out of reach of children, teens, and pets
🛑 Safely dispose of unused medications through FDA or DEA take-back programs to prevent misuse
🛑 Know the warning signs of an overdose—clammy skin, blue lips or fingertips, gurgling noises, or slowed breathing—and call 911 immediately

This is a fight for our children, our families, and our communities.

As a longtime partner of our local Chambers, I know firsthand how critical this work is to creating opportunity, and I’ve been proud to collaborate on initiatives that bring new investment, strengthen workforce development, and ensure small businesses have the tools to thrive.

To reward Putin for his illegal invasion of Ukraine, and his brutal genocide inside Ukraine, would be to send the exact opposite message that we must be sending to dictators, and would-be-dictators, across the globe.

'1953851058154774878',"Each week, we honor extraordinary individuals and organizations whose service reflects the highest ideals of the American spirit. Today, we celebrate a group that has been a pillar of service for nearly 80 years—meet this week’s Hometown Heroes, VFW Post 6393 Yardley Pennsylvania. 
 
Founded in 1946 by local World War II veterans, Post 6393 has continued to answer the call to serve. With over 200 members, they remain a lifeline for veterans, a partner to families, and a cornerstone of our community. Their work spans generations—helping our Vietnam veterans secure long-overdue benefits, welcoming our younger veterans of the Global War on Terrorism, and creating a place where every veteran feels valued, respected, and at home.
 
This year, their unmatched record of service was recognized on the national stage as VFW Post 6393 was named the 2025 Outstanding National Community Service Post of the Year for the Eastern Conference—an honor awarded to only one post in each region of the country. It is among the highest distinctions in the VFW, recognizing not only the dollars donated, hours volunteered, and miles driven, but the lives lifted, restored, and forever changed.
 
Under Commander Kirk Saboda’s leadership, Post 6393 has set a new standard for what a modern VFW can be—forward-looking, inclusive, and deeply engaged in every facet of community life. They deliver free, expert guidance to veterans navigating the VA system, run a home repair program that has restored safety and dignity through more than 60 completed projects for older veterans, and have remodeled their facilities to be fully accessible for all. Through the Code Blue initiative with AHTN, they stand watch on the coldest winter nights, ensuring no homeless veteran—or civilian—is left without shelter.
 
That same spirit of service extends seamlessly into our broader community. They sponsor Cub Scout Pack 30 and Venture Crew 6393, host Veterans Night to instill patriotism and civic responsibility in young people, and invite Scouts to take an active role in major community fundraisers, including their annual Classic Car Show and Wrangler Fest. Their poppy campaigns at Easter, Memorial Day, and Veterans Day fuel an emergency relief fund—ready to cover heating bills, urgent home repairs, and other critical needs at a moment’s notice.
 
Whether folding the flag with a Cub Scout, repairing a veteran’s home, mentoring the next generation, or standing shoulder-to-shoulder with a neighbor in crisis, Post 6393 lives its creed every single day: “No one does more for veterans.”
 
Over the years, I have had the honor of working alongside these extraordinary patriots—hearing their stories, learning from their hard-earned wisdom, and witnessing the depth of their impact firsthand. Their insight has shaped my work, their friendship is a privilege, and their steadfast partnership in serving our community is one of my greatest honors. I am proud to call these heroes not only partners in service, but true friends.
 
Please join me in congratulating Yardley–Lower Makefield VFW Post 6393 on this national honor—and in thanking them for their unwavering example that service to country is a lifelong calling.",en,Tweet,2,19,5,7,2209,2025-08-08 17:09:27,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gx15LiPWQAAksvO.jpg

This structural failure replaces fair competition with manufactured outcomes, rewards extremism, punishes consensus, and accelerates the polarization that tears our country apart. 

That’s why, on the first day of every Congress, I introduce a sweeping reform agenda to restore integrity to our democracy. At its core is my CLEAN Elections Act, which ends gerrymandering by moving redistricting to independent, non-partisan commissions nationwide.

I’m calling on leaders at every level to join me in putting the people back in charge—and rebuilding a system that earns their trust. Because in a true democracy, voters should choose their leaders—not the other way around.

'1953174951382384658',"Last week, I formally requested an EPA review of the proposed development at 136 Old Oxford Valley Road after hearing directly from residents about concerns over stormwater runoff, drainage, traffic congestion, and the irreversible loss of open space. I met with neighbors, visited the site, and took action to ensure those concerns are taken seriously.

At last night’s zoning board meeting, those voices were once again overlooked.

This isn’t just about one property—it’s about ensuring our community’s future is shaped by the people who call it home. Too often, we’ve seen development advance without fully accounting for long-term consequences to the environment, infrastructure, and quality of life. I’ve long advocated for a better approach: one that prioritizes thoughtful planning and the voices of the people most affected. 

I’ll continue working alongside our community to protect our open space, and call on every elected official who values long-term stewardship to join us in putting those principles into practice.

'1952438522771640675',"Five years ago today, we made history.

The Great American Outdoors Act—my bipartisan, landmark legislation—was signed into law, delivering one of the biggest conservation wins in a generation.

It permanently funded the Land and Water Conservation Fund, tackled decades of deferred maintenance in our national parks, and made long-overdue investments in clean air, safe drinking water, and public lands for all.

Here in PA-1, that means more protected green spaces, restored habitats, cleaner streams, and outdoor spaces our families can enjoy for generations. These victories were made possible by working hand-in-hand with our local partners who know our land best.

That same spirit of partnership continues to guide my work forward. In February, I introduced the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program Reauthorization Act—a critical next step, developed hand-in-hand with our local conservation leaders, to protect one of our region’s most vital natural resources.

I first met Luke in 2018. At 19, a diving accident changed everything—paralyzing him from the waist down. But from that moment on, it wasn’t his injury that defined him, it was his strength and unshakable positivity.  

What’s unfolded since isn’t just a story of recovery—it’s a story of determination, of a young man committed to walking again, and a community committed to walking with him. Through it all, Luke has been a source of light—lifting others up even as he faces his own challenges.

'1951357015105708087',"Each week, we share stories of extraordinary individuals across our district whose lives exemplify courage, character, and commitment to something greater than themselves. Today, we honor a true American leader—meet this week’s Hometown Hero, Colonel Eric Swenson of Churchville.
 
A graduate of Council Rock and the United States Military Academy at West Point, Colonel Swenson has spent over 25 years in uniform, serving our nation with honor. He is not only a decorated Army officer and combat veteran—he’s a scholar, strategist, and public servant whose leadership has left an indelible mark both at home and abroad.
 
With a PhD in Industrial Engineering from Penn State, and advanced degrees from the Naval and Army War Colleges, Col. Swenson has led everywhere from the battlefield to the classroom—commanding engineer battalions, shaping military strategy, and mentoring the next generation of Army leaders. As Commander of the Army Corps’ St. Paul District, Col. Swenson led critical infrastructure and recovery efforts across five states.
 
In January, when devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles County—killing 12 and destroying more than 6,800 structures—Col. Swenson was called in to lead the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ emergency response. The scale of destruction was staggering. The grief was raw. Yet under his steady command, the mission became what officials called “the fastest, safest, and most community-integrated cleanup operation in California history.”
 
As U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll put it: “Your team cleared debris, repaired infrastructure, and restored essential services—but what really sets you apart is the trust you built with the community.”
 
Col. Swenson walked side by side with survivors, listened to their stories, stood in the ashes of what they lost, and helped chart a path forward—one phone call, one handshake, one act of compassion at a time.
 
Now preparing to assume command of the U.S. Army Corps’ North Atlantic Division—overseeing critical operations across the Northeast and Europe—Colonel Swenson continues to serve with humility, brilliance, and a deep sense of duty to the American people.

'1951324241413947545',"🚨 Lyme disease is surging across Bucks and Montgomery Counties—and Pennsylvania now accounts for nearly 30% of all cases nationwide.

This isn’t a surprise. It’s the result of years of warnings that went unheeded. That’s why I’ve been working with local health officials, scientists, and national advocates to lead a strong, sustained federal response.

Here’s what we’re doing:

I’m leading a bipartisan push to modernize how our country prevents, detects, treats, and responds to tick-borne illnesses, including:

✅ Kay Hagan TICK Act Reauthorization – To reestablish a coordinated national strategy
✅ LymeX Authorization Act – To accelerate innovation in diagnostics and treatments
✅ Children Inflicted by Lyme Disabilities Act – To expand protections for kids with chronic Lyme
✅ BITE Act – Creates an AI-powered tick outbreak alert system
✅ Tick Identification Pilot Program – Supports state-level photo-based tracking programs

I’ve also fought to expand Lyme research funding through both the Defense and Health Appropriations bills, to ensure science gets the investment it needs.

But until there’s a cure, prevention is key. As we head into Lyme Disease Awareness Month, here’s how to protect yourself and your family:

• Use EPA-registered repellents (DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus)
• Wear light-colored clothing and tuck in your pants/shirt
• Shower within 2 hours of outdoor activity
• Do a full-body tick check—especially behind knees, underarms, hairline, waistband 
• Check pets and gear—ask your vet about year-round tick preventatives

⚠️ Watch for symptoms:
• Bullseye rash (may not always appear)
• Fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain
• In kids: memory issues, joint aches, behavioral changes

🕒 Early detection is key. The sooner it’s caught, the easier it is to treat.

Bobby was an Eagle Scout, a volunteer firefighter, a musician, a Pennridge honor student, and above all, a servant to others. When a medical condition kept him from joining the U.S. Marines, he did not give up on his call to serve—he found a new path. He traveled to Ukraine, where he spent more than two years delivering humanitarian aid, rescuing the wounded, and ultimately fighting on the front lines, where he was killed in action this past January. 

Bobby was not only a hometown hero—he was a global defender of liberty and justice. 

His legacy reminds us that patriotism isn’t confined by borders. It’s measured by the courage to stand up for what’s right, no matter where the need is greatest. 

We will never forget Bobby, and will continue to hold his family in our hearts and prayers.",en,Tweet,1,21,2,5,1755,2025-07-27 19:13:57,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gw4imNzXUAEgj1Z.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gw4imN2WoAEL_Je.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gw4imN3WYAAE4mz.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gw4imNxWwAABj1i.jpg"

I was proud to help make this project a reality by securing $545,000 in federal Community Project Funding to support a broader, county-wide initiative I championed to strengthen police-community relations and build safer, more connected neighborhoods.

This investment has driven a series of community-first initiatives, including:

✅ Expanded co-responder programs placing social workers alongside police
✅ Community gardens where officers and youth work side-by-side
✅ Law enforcement training symposiums and dialogue events led by The Peace Center
✅ Support for a new Veterans Response Team
✅ Fellowships, student scholarships, and expanded educational outreach
✅ Mini-grants for police departments to host reconciliation events
✅ Public murals—like this one—that bring people together and celebrate our history

For those who grew up in Levittown in the ‘70s and ‘80s, Chuck Mangione’s ""Feels So Good"" was so much more than just a song. It was a ""snow day"" anthem on WBCB radio—one of those tracks that somehow always seemed to make everything feel a little more magical. Whether you were lying in bed on a snowy morning waiting for your school name to be called, relaxing in your living room, driving down Levittown Parkway, or hearing it echo from your neighbor’s garage, it was the soundtrack to so many special memories.

Earlier this week, I met with Education Secretary McMahon in my office to convey that unfreezing these funds was my #1 priority —it was necessary and urgent. I made sure she knew these dollars aren’t just numbers—they’re lifelines for our students, educators, and families who depend on them.

Today, we got results. 

The administration is officially releasing all of the previously frozen funding—billions for after-school programs, ESL instruction, and other services families so many in our community rely on.

This has been a top priority from day one, and I’m grateful to have worked side by side with our local educators, advocates, and families every step of the way—pushing OMB for clarity and keeping the pressure on—just as I did to secure the full five-year Head Start renewal for our community.

I will always fight to ensure our schools have the resources and tools they need so every child in PA-1 has access to a strong start and bright future.

'1948792507258863729',"Each week, we share stories from across our district of those whose efforts create lasting change in the lives around them. Today, we shine a light on two such individuals—meet this week's Hometown Heroes, Kevin Travers, a special education teacher at @BristolTwpSD, and @BristolTwpPD Officer Tyler Aspell.
 
Over 20 years ago, Kevin started Drummers With Attitude with little more than a few buckets, some sticks, and an idea: to create a space where every student feels like they belong. For Kevin, drumming had been a lifeline throughout his childhood—a way to cope, to focus, and to heal. He knew just how powerful that could be, and that his students could benefit from that same outlet.
 
Since then, Drummers With Attitude has become a home for students of all abilities and backgrounds—those with disabilities, facing behavioral challenges, athletes, performers, and everyone in between. Different stories, one beat. They learn together, perform together, and take care of each other like family.
 
One of the early members of that family was Tyler Aspell.
 
Tyler grew up in Bristol Township and joined DWA as a student at Truman High School. The program gave him a sense of belonging and confidence that carried into a life of service. He joined the U.S. Army National Guard, became a Philadelphia police officer, and now serves as a Bristol Township Police Officer.
 
Recently, with his nephew now in the program, Officer Aspell returned to perform with the group, back where it all began. For the students in DWA, he wasn’t just a police officer—he was one of them. A familiar face, a hometown success story, and a reminder of everything they’re capable of becoming.
 
That’s the legacy Kevin has built—one that doesn’t just create percussionists but builds leaders and brighter futures.
 
In 2023, I had the honor of inviting Drummers With Attitude to perform in our nation’s capital. Watching those students from our community take the stage in Washington, D.C, was an incredibly powerful moment.
 
To Kevin, thank you for creating something so extraordinary, for building a space where our students feel valued, capable, and inspired to follow their rhythm and believe in their potential. And to Officer Aspel, thank you for your service to both country and community, and for being a role model to the next generation.

In Pennsylvania, MA beneficiaries save over $3,000 a year on average and experience 70% fewer hospital readmissions compared to traditional Medicare.

I have been, and will continue to be, firm in my efforts to protect and improve essential programs like Medicare Advantage because they deliver real results for our seniors.

Today, I asked Alignment Health CEO Dawn Maroney how integrated care is improving patient outcomes, and Dr. Brian Miller how we can reduce administrative burdens like prior authorization that delay care and drain provider resources.

The evidence is undeniable: Medicare Advantage is essential, it works, and it can and must be strengthened—not sidelined.

✅ Build a new 1,100-foot dock
✅ Modernize offloading operations
✅ Dredge over 70,000 cubic yards of material
✅ Upgrade rail lines to expand freight capacity

This past weekend, we gathered for Unity Day, the event Carla built with love, vision, and purpose. It was moving, powerful, and unmistakably her. Though her physical presence was missing, her spirit filled every corner of that celebration.
 
Carla believed in the power of unity, not as a slogan, but as a way of life. Through Unity Day and her Boots on the Ground Foundation, she brought people together across every divide, fed families in crisis, and gave hope to those who felt unseen or unheard. She believed in meeting people where they are—and lifting them up with dignity and grace.
 
She also poured her heart into our young people, spotlighting Bucks County students who excelled in school, in service, and in sports—because, in her words, “Our kids need to know we see them.”

'1943712882077671667',"Each week, we share the stories of individuals across our district who go above and beyond in service to others. Today, we honor the memory of an extraordinary young man—23-year-old Bobby Pietrangelo of Sellersville—who gave his life defending freedom on the front lines of Ukraine.
 
Bobby was many things—an honor student at Pennridge High School, an Eagle Scout with Troop 354 in Hatboro, a volunteer firefighter in Silverdale and Souderton, a musician, a mentor, and a quiet but constant force for good in every space he entered. He had an extraordinary gift for humor and lightness—able to lift spirits and spark laughter, even in the darkest of times.
 
After a kidney condition disqualified him from joining the U.S. Marine Corps—a dream he held since childhood—Bobby didn’t walk away from his desire to serve. Instead, he looked outward. He looked to where he was needed most. And in the midst of one of the world’s fiercest battles for liberty, he found his purpose.
 
In April 2022, Bobby traveled to Ukraine—not for glory or recognition but to serve. He delivered critical supplies to the front lines, taught lifesaving medical skills, and recovered the wounded and fallen from bombed-out cities. But as the war intensified, so did his commitment. In June 2024, he officially enlisted in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
 
For 26 months, Bobby served with extraordinary courage. He was shot at, bombed, and injured—and returned to serve every time. But then, on January 3rd, less than three months after surviving a serious head injury in combat, he was killed in action in Pokrovsk.
 
Bobby and I share the same belief: that freedom is worth defending. That when tyranny threatens peace, we don’t stand aside—we stand up.
 
And Bobby didn’t just stand—he stepped forward. With humility. With conviction. With a fearless determination to do what was right, no matter the cost.
 
He was more than a hometown hero. He was a defender of freedom.
 
To Bobby’s family—thank you for giving the world a soul so brave, so kind, and so full of purpose. His courage, his faith, and his unwavering call to serve will inspire generations to come.
 
A Celebration of Bobby’s Life is being held on Saturday, July 26th, in Sellersville. If you wish to pay your respects, you may contact his mother, Dana at rememberingbobbymoose@gmail.com.

I set out with two clear objectives:

✅ Make sure funding continued through the end of the school year.
✅ Secure a full five-year renewal so families could plan for the future with confidence.

We delivered both.

I’ve always fought for these programs, and I will continue working to ensure Head Start stays strong and keeps opening doors of opportunity for families across our community for years to come.￼",en,Tweet,0,47,3,83,32838,2025-07-01 23:09:38,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1940154019143733423',"Our laws should provide consistent protection for all survivors of domestic violence and stalking. Yet under current federal statutes, convicted stalkers and abusive dating partners remain able to legally purchase firearms—a dangerous disparity known as the boyfriend loophole.

Today, I introduced the Strengthening Protections for Domestic Violence and Stalking Survivors Act, bipartisan legislation that will:

✅ Prohibit firearm access for individuals convicted of misdemeanor stalking or domestic abuse, regardless of marital status
✅ Update and modernize outdated legal definitions to ensure consistent protection for all survivors
✅ Establish a uniform standard that treats all abusers equally under federal law

Since coming to Congress, I’ve worked with families, survivors, and local organizations to advance reforms that improve safety, like Kayden’s Law—legislation I authored and saw signed into law through the 2022 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act to better protect children exposed to domestic violence.

I will fight just as hard to see this legislation enacted. No survivor should remain at risk because the law failed to keep pace with reality. We have a clear responsibility—and the opportunity—to address this gap and strengthen protections nationwide.

'1939752574984372284',"The moment I learned our Head Start funding was at risk, I immediately got to work with the @BucksIU22 team to protect it and ensure no family in our community would lose access to these critical services.

I pressed federal decision-makers at every level to ensure they understood just how vital this funding is to Bucks County—and that protecting it was my top priority.

In May, I set two clear goals:

✅ Step One: Secure an extension through the end of the school year—which we accomplished.

✅ Step Two: Deliver a FULL five-year renewal. 

Today, I’m proud to share that we delivered on both. 

As a result, hundreds of children and families across our community can count on the strong start, stability, and opportunity they need and deserve.

Head Start is more than a program—it’s a launchpad for our kids and a lifeline for working families. Thank you to Dr. Hoffman and the entire Bucks IU team for your incredible partnership and leadership.

'1938634089092841503',"Every week, we highlight stories that capture the spirit of service and the people who make our communities stronger. Today, we honor a remarkable guardian of Bensalem—meet this week’s Hometown Hero: @BensalemPolice Officer Christian Martinka.
 
For Officer Martinka, service isn’t just a profession—it’s a family legacy he proudly carries forward. After nearly four years with the Philadelphia Police Department, he joined the Bensalem Township Police Department, following in the footsteps of his father, who dedicated 35 years to Philadelphia PD, and alongside his brother, Thomas Jr., who now serves beside him. That legacy, combined with his exceptional dedication, is why he was named Bensalem Township Police Officer of the Year. In just the past year, he conducted 416 traffic stops, made 74 criminal arrests, and completed 831 incident reports—an extraordinary record by any measure. But numbers alone don’t capture the integrity, compassion, and steady leadership that define him behind the badge.
 
Whether he’s guiding recruits as a field training officer or stepping up in critical moments, he has become a pillar of steady leadership and quiet resolve within his department. On and off duty, he demonstrates our shared belief that leadership means uniting people and elevating those around us.
 
As a volunteer coach with the Police Athletic League, he invests his time mentoring local youth, teaching them discipline, respect, and teamwork. Recently, he led the Junior Boys’ basketball team to a championship title—a reflection of the same commitment that defines his service in uniform. In every role, he proves that public service is not just about enforcing the law—it’s about protecting people, building trust, and lifting up others.
 
Over the past year, Officer Martinka earned seven official commendations, including Officer of the Quarter, a unit citation, and multiple awards for recovering illegally possessed guns—work that undoubtedly prevented violence and saved lives.
 
As someone who has worked alongside law enforcement my entire career, I know how much we ask of these men and women. They run toward danger so the rest of us don’t have to, and Officer Martinka is among the finest I have encountered—his courage matched by his compassion, his skill by his integrity. Standing with our police officers means more than recognition—it means fighting to ensure they have the training, resources, and support they need to come home safely at the end of every shift, and I will continue to do exactly that.

Today, we shine a light on a man who has exemplified that spirit every day for the last 35 years. Meet this week's Hometown Hero: Lieutenant John Michniewicz of the Middletown Township Police Department.

Lieutenant Michniewicz began his law enforcement journey in 1990, graduating from the Philadelphia Police Academy with a clear and unwavering mission: to serve and protect our community. Over the next three and a half decades, he became a cornerstone of the Middletown Township Police Department—rising through the ranks as Patrolman, K-9 Officer, Detective, Sergeant, and ultimately Lieutenant. In every role, he led by example, bringing a deep sense of duty, professionalism, and compassion that elevated the entire department and set a lasting standard for those who served alongside him.
 
This week, I had the honor of joining MTPD To celebrate Lieutenant Michniewicz as he prepares to retire after 35 years of distinguished service. As someone who works closely with our law enforcement officers day in and day out, I witness the strength, sacrifice, and dedication it takes to protect our communities, and Lieutenant Michniewicz embodies all of that and more. He has not only earned the respect of his fellow officers but also the trust and admiration of our entire community. His leadership, steady presence, and unwavering commitment to public safety have left a lasting mark on Middletown, and his legacy will continue to guide the department for years to come.
 
Beyond his day-to-day service, Lieutenant Michniewicz played a critical role in preparing the department for the future. He conducted countless background investigations to ensure recruits met the highest standards of character and professionalism. He also made a strong commitment to developing his professional leadership, graduating from some of the most respected law enforcement programs in the country, including Northwestern University’s School of Police Staff and Command, the Police Executive Research Forum’s Senior Management Institute, and the FBI’s Executive Development Program. Through his example and mentorship, he helped raise the bar for policing—not just in Middletown but across our region.

'1933557376201662823',"Each week, we highlight extraordinary individuals across our district working to make a difference in our community. Today, we honor a woman whose resilience and resolve have turned tragedy into a powerful force for change. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: Jill Perez Gobora of Newtown.
 
In 2011, Jill’s sister Amy and Amy’s two young children, Molly and Gregory, were senselessly murdered in a horrific act of domestic violence. Out of that unimaginable grief, Jill made it her life’s mission to protect others from experiencing the same pain—and she has done just that.
 
In 2012, Jill, a preschool teacher at Magic Cottage in Yardley, founded Amy’s Kisses, a Bucks County-based nonprofit that has become one of our region’s most impactful grassroots organizations in the fight to end domestic violence. Its mission is twofold: to educate children early about the signs of healthy relationships and to empower students—especially those facing adversity—through educational opportunities. Since its founding, the organization has raised over $200,000 and delivered life-changing programming and resources to families, schools, and shelters throughout our community and across the country.
 
Through Amy’s Kisses’ signature program, A Bowl Full of Hearts, Jill has helped over 600 young students across 35 classrooms begin to understand what it means to build healthy, respectful relationships. The program is anchored around the children's book Jill wrote in her sister’s memory—now used in schools throughout Bucks County and beyond as a thoughtful, age-appropriate tool for teaching the building blocks of empathy, trust, and kindness. It's a simple but meaningful way to start critical conversations early and carry forward a legacy rooted in both love and prevention.
 
In addition, through the foundation, Jill awards college scholarships to students who have overcome unimaginable challenges, donates Kindle learning libraries and classroom technology to underserved schools, and partners with organizations like A Woman’s Place to ensure that children and families have the resources they need to stay safe, heal, and thrive.
 
As the author of Kayden’s Law and a proud champion of the bipartisan reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, I’ve worked in Congress to strengthen protections for survivors and ensure that the safety of children is never an afterthought. But lasting change requires a united effort. It means partnering with local leaders and advocates like Jill, whose work is making an impact where it matters most: in classrooms, homes, and communities. Together, we are advancing a shared mission—to prevent violence before it starts, to protect the vulnerable, and to build a future where every child grows up safe, supported, and seen.
 
Jill is not just carrying on her sister’s legacy, she’s building her own—one that is changing how we educate, protect, and respond to domestic violence. She is making our community stronger, smarter, and safer.

So today, I delivered a communication to Attorney General Bondi demanding clear action from the Department of Justice to crack down on this growing wave of fraud. These scams are targeting our seniors, veterans, and financially vulnerable neighbors—and we need a whole-of-government response to stop them.

In my letter, I pressed DOJ to:

➡️ Detail what’s currently being done to combat fraudulent robocalls
➡️ Identify gaps in authority or resources that Congress can address
➡️ Explain how they’re coordinating with the FCC, FTC, and state leaders

This is part of a broader push I’m leading in Congress to protect consumers and hold bad actors accountable, including:

✅ The QUIET Act – to expose AI-generated robocalls and toughen penalties
✅ The STOP Scammers Act – to hit foreign scam networks where it hurts

We worked together on solutions, and this week, I introduced the bipartisan Healthcare Cybersecurity Act to strengthen our defenses and protect the systems families rely on every day.

✔️ Expands cybersecurity training for frontline health care workers
✔️ Directs a full-scale review of vulnerabilities across the health sector

Over 46 million Americans had their personal health data breached in just one year. That’s not just a privacy issue—it’s a public safety threat.

Her record of excellence earned her the National Defense Service Medal, Navy & Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, three Naval Meritorious Service Medals, and an extraordinary 25 Gold Wreath Awards for outstanding recruiting contributions during three of our nation’s most pivotal military operations—the Persian Gulf War, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.
 
But retirement didn’t mark the end of Connie’s service—it marked the beginning of a new mission, every bit as meaningful.
 
As Executive Director of the Guardians of the National Cemetery at Washington Crossing, Connie leads a devoted team of volunteers who carry out one of our nation’s most sacred responsibilities: honoring those who served. From organizing memorial ceremonies and greeting funeral processions to offering final salutes and ensuring every veteran is laid to rest with dignity—they are present, steadfast, and reverent. In every kind of weather, they stand watch. And on the final Thursday of each month, they hold a solemn ceremony for veterans with no family present. Under Connie’s leadership, the Guardians carry out sacred acts of remembrance that ensure no veteran—and no family—is ever overlooked, unhonored, or forgotten. Every life is acknowledged, every sacrifice remembered, and every service met with the gratitude it deserves.
 
As a leader with the Travis Manion Foundation, Connie plays a central role in shaping the next generation through the “Character Does Matter” program. Across our community and region, she mentors students and instills in them the values that define true leadership—integrity, courage, respect, service, and a deep love of country. She encourages them to honor our veterans, serve their communities, and live lives rooted in character and purpose. Whether organizing service projects, building tributes to those who served, or guiding young people to lead by example, Connie empowers our next generation to become citizens who give more than they take.
 
I’ve had the distinct honor of working alongside Connie over the years, and I’ve seen firsthand the heart and dedication she brings to everything she does. She gives of herself fully—to our veterans, our youth, and our community—asks for nothing in return, and delivers more than most could imagine.
 
Connie, thank you—for your courage, mentorship, leadership, and love of this country. You are, in every sense, a true Hometown Hero.",en,Tweet,1,14,2,6,1489,2025-06-06 18:24:32,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GsxuNNLXAAAeDhK.jpg

That’s why I introduced the bipartisan GAIN Act: to put the US in the lead of a global effort to stop it.

The GAIN Act authorizes U.S. participation in the Davos Alzheimer’s Collaborative, a groundbreaking international partnership accelerating early diagnosis, cutting-edge research, and access to care around the world .

With: 

🚨 150 million people projected to be affected by 2050
🚨 $1.3 trillion in annual global costs

—we can’t afford to wait.

The fight against Alzheimer’s can’t be piecemeal, it must be united, urgent, and bold. That’s exactly what the GAIN Act delivers— real solutions and real hope.

'1928490763135947254',"Each week, we share stories from across our district that shine a light on the heroes among us. Today, we honor the life and service of Alec Campbell—a DCNR Resource Ranger at Tyler State Park, a devoted father, and a true public servant—whose life was tragically cut short this past weekend at just 38 years old.
 
Alec’s passing is a heartbreaking loss—not only to those who knew and loved him but to our entire community. Rangers like Alec rarely seek spotlight but their service is essential. They are the quiet guardians of our natural spaces—educators, protectors, first responders, and stewards—often putting themselves in harm’s way to ensure the safety and well-being of others.
 
Alec embodied that spirit of service in every sense. Along with restoring trails, removing invasive species, and planting natives, perhaps his most important work was leading volunteer and youth projects that have left a lasting mark on Tyler State Park. He was a patient teacher, a passionate conservationist, and a calming presence for visitors from all walks of life. Whether working with young Scouts or guiding students through the forest, Alec always made people feel seen, heard, and safe.
 
His background in psychology, his gift for connection, and his deep love for the outdoors made him more than a ranger—he was a bridge between people and nature, between learning and healing.
 
It’s easy to take that kind of service for granted. But we shouldn’t. Because our parks don’t care for themselves. Our trails don’t repair themselves. And when someone gets lost or needs help, it’s rangers like Alec who answer the call.
 
Please join me in extending our prayers and condolences to Alec’s wife, Rena, their two young boys, Calder and Miles, and his @DCNRnews family. Let us honor Alec by remembering the value of quiet service—and by recognizing the brave men and women like him who dedicate their lives to preserving, protecting, and serving our community every single day.

'1925945871067173090',"Each week, we celebrate individuals across our district whose acts of selflessness and generosity inspire us all. As we approach Memorial Day, we’re proud to highlight a young leader whose actions remind us that honoring those who’ve served our nation should never be limited to just one day—it’s something we must carry forward every day through how we live and how we give back. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: 16-year-old Ryan Lovenstein of Southampton.
 
Ryan, a sophomore at William Tennent High School, grew up next door to Joseph Martines, a proud World War II Army Air Force veteran and beloved member of our community. Their friendship grew naturally—from front porch conversations and Phillies games on the radio to a shared respect that spanned generations. Through Joe, Ryan gained firsthand insight into true character, patriotism, and service.
 
When Joe passed away in 2023 at the age of 98, Ryan felt moved to ensure Joe’s legacy lived on. He built the Joseph Martines Memorial Field, a wiffleball field in his own backyard, complete with a custom scoreboard bearing Joe’s name. Quickly, the field became a community gathering place, uniting neighbors, teammates, and friends in the spirit of remembrance, friendship, and patriotism.
 
Yet Ryan’s efforts didn’t stop there.
 
Last weekend, Ryan expanded his vision, hosting the first annual Wiffle Ball for the Wounded tournament at Tamanend Park. Rallying local businesses, volunteers, and community members, Ryan raised nearly $2,000 for the @TMFoundation, an organization dedicated to supporting veterans and families of fallen service members. What began as a tribute to a single veteran has blossomed into something greater—a community movement inspired by gratitude, kindness, and service.
 
Ryan’s example reminds us that truly honoring our veterans goes beyond reflection—it requires action. He has shown us that patriotism is best expressed not through occasional gestures but through meaningful acts of kindness, service, and community spirit.
 
To Ryan—thank you for honoring our heroes. Join me in applauding this extraordinary young leader—his future is bright, and thanks to him, the legacy of one American hero now lives on in a way that brings people together and lifts us all.",en,Tweet,0,7,0,5,1511,2025-05-23 17:04:12,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrpVjqIXYAE0iON.jpg

That’s why I introduced the Barriers to Suicide Act, a bipartisan bill I’m leading with @RepDonBeyer to fund suicide prevention infrastructure at high-risk locations like bridges and rail stations in our community and across the nation. These barriers are proven to save lives and provide a critical moment of intervention.

Today, @RepGolden and I introduced the bipartisan Stop Foreign Funds in Elections Act to ban foreign contributions in all taxpayer-funded elections—federal, state, and local—ensuring they’re free from foreign manipulation at every level.

This is part of a broader fight I’m leading to restore trust in our democracy—ensuring every U.S. citizen, regardless of party, has the right to vote in every taxpayer-funded election; ending congressional stock trading; banning deceptive deepfake ads; and dismantling partisan gerrymandering once and for all.

Because defending democracy means action—and I’ll keep fighting to make sure it works for the people, not special interests or foreign powers.

This week: the Congressional EMS Caucus.

As a certified EMT myself, this mission isn’t just professional—it’s personal. Our EMS professionals are the unsung heroes of our health care system. They’re the first to arrive, the last to leave, and the ones who stand between crisis and care every single day.

The Congressional EMS Caucus is dedicated to educating Congress on the essential role EMS plays—from delivering life-saving emergency care and managing non-emergent situations to leading disaster and tactical response. We’re working to ensure EMS has the recognition, support, and resources it deserves.

That’s why I’ve fought to deliver results that make a real difference:

✔️ Secured $674,000 in FY23 funding for local EMS and rescue squads
✔️ Delivered over $700,000 to Bucks County Emergency Services to modernize emergency response and enhance public safety
✔️ Advocated for stronger reimbursement rates, better training programs, and sustainable support for rural and urban EMS alike
✔️ Continued pushing for long-term investments in recruitment, mental health resources, and resilience planning for EMS professionals

This #NationalEMSWeek, we honor those who answer the call—day or night, rain or shine. And here in PA-1, we’re lucky to have some of the very best. I’ll never stop fighting to ensure our EMS heroes have the tools, funding, and respect they need to keep saving lives and protecting our communities.",en,Tweet,1,6,1,10,1261,2025-05-21 21:02:45,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Grf4-BIWgAA8m2E.jpg

'1923418134142243053',"Each week, we shine a light on a Hometown Hero—someone whose service, sacrifice, or spirit reflects the very best of our PA-1 community.
 
But this week, we don’t honor just one. We honor every man and woman who has ever worn the badge to protect and serve our neighborhoods. Because every officer who puts on the uniform, every deputy who answers the call, every trooper who runs toward the danger, they are all Hometown Heroes.
 
National Police Week is a solemn reminder that behind every badge is a person willing to risk everything for someone they may never meet. A neighbor. A stranger. A child. A community. And in our community, we have felt that sacrifice deeply. Since 1898, sixteen of our own have laid down their lives while protecting Bucks County:

PA Deputy Constable Erwin Mondeau, 1898
PA Constable Henry Kolbe, 1914
Bucks County Sheriff Abram Kulp, 1927
Quakertown Boro Officer Edward Shearer, 1936
Dublin Boro Chief Eli Myers, 1965
Bristol Township Detective George Stuckey, 1972
Bensalem Township Officer James Armstrong, 1975
Bensalem Township Officer Robert Yezzi, 1980
Bucks County Deputy Sheriff Thomas Bateman, 1986
Bucks County Deputy Sheriff George Warta, Jr., 1986
Bucks County Ranger Stanley Flynn, 1993
Plumstead Township Officer Joseph Hanusey III, 2002
Newtown Borough Officer Brian Gregg, 2005
Middletown Township Detective Christopher Jones, 2009
Bucks County Ranger Thomas Booz, 2020
Warrington Township K9 Officer Stephen Plum, 2022
 
They wore different uniforms, served different towns, but shared a common mission: to keep our PA-1 community safe, no matter the cost.
 
Officer Brian Gregg, just 46 years old, was shot and killed by a drunk driving suspect he was standing guard over. Detective Chris Jones, just 37, was struck and killed by a drunk driver while conducting a routine traffic stop. Officer Joe Hanusey, just 30, a rising star, earned the Top Gun Award for most DUI arrests in Pennsylvania and poured his heart into Plumstead’s Youth Aid Panel, giving first-time offenders a second chance and mentoring our young people toward a better path. And Officer Stephen Plum, just 38, a proud U.S. Marine Corps veteran, died of a heart attack shortly after responding to a tense barricade situation; his final act was one of protection.
 
These men didn’t just serve—they embodied what it means to be a Hometown Hero. Their memory lives on not only in our words but in our actions. So, please join our community this Monday, May 19, at 7:00 p.m. at St. Andrew Catholic Church in Newtown for the annual Bucks County Police Memorial Ceremony to celebrate their service and sacrifice.
 
And while we honor their memory, and the memory of all the PA-1 residents who wore the badge and gave their lives while serving other communities, we must stand with those still serving. Every day, our officers quietly sacrifice—missing holidays, bearing unseen burdens, stepping into danger—because they believe in duty, community, and something greater than themselves. As a former FBI Special Agent, I’ve seen their courage up close. I know what they carry—and I will never stop fighting to ensure they have what they need: resources, training, support, and the respect they’ve earned.
 
And let’s carry that spirit forward. Let’s make every week Police Week. A handshake, a kind word, a show of support—small acts that remind our officers they are not alone.
 
To the families of the fallen: your loved ones are never forgotten. And to all those who have served or are still serving: we thank you and we stand with you—today and always.

My policies of Patriotic Common Sense and Economic Patriotism, advanced though my unapologetic belief in bipartisanship, are precisely the same values and common-sense approach that are adopted by the overwhelming majority of our PA-1 community and of our nation.

✅ Wages that match the real cost of living in your community
✅ A fair structure for tipped and young workers
✅ A phased approach that works for small businesses
✅ A path forward that strengthens families without raising the deficit

Every day, our letter carriers go above and beyond—not just delivering mail, but delivering hope, help, and heart to the people they serve. Since coming to Congress, I’ve been proud to fight for the resources, protections, and respect they deserve because these hard working men and women keep our community and country moving forward.

This annual drive is more than a collection—it’s a reflection of their unwavering commitment to service. Postal workers are the backbone of our neighborhoods, and I’ll always be their champion.

For their scout projects, Andrew designed and built a nature-inspired playground at Windmill Day Camp and School in Doylestown, giving back to the place where his own learning journey began. His project now provides a creative and safe space for future generations to grow and explore.

Stephen created two custom picture frame shelves for the Pennsburg Thrift Store, thoughtfully designed with fabric-lined slots to safely store and organize merchandise. His project improved the store’s functionality and helped support the local families and individuals who rely on it.

Maxwell led the landscaping design, fundraising, and installation of plantings for the FOP Lodge’s Fallen Officer Memorial—a thoughtful, enduring tribute that honors our heroes and brings new beauty and meaning to the space.

Brandon combined his love of history and nature by designing and installing a Historical Storybook Sign at Lenape Park in Perkasie. He researched the park’s landmarks, gathered stories, photographs, and created a visitor-friendly map.

These are the kinds of acts that reflect true leadership and create lasting ripple effects. But behind every Eagle Scout is a foundation of support and sacrifice—a special thank you to the incredible moms of Andrew, Stephen, Maxwell, Brandon, and all our PA-1 Scout moms, whose guidance and encouragement have shaped these young men into the outstanding leaders they’ve become.",en,Tweet,0,4,0,1,1186,2025-05-11 19:29:36,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GqsDwDZXgAAlyIp.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GqsDwDbWAAAAOJg.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GqsDwDjW0AAQtrZ.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GqsDwDcWQAE5rMl.jpg"

She’s the heart of our family, the one who held it all together with quiet strength, deep faith, and unconditional love. Raising eight kids wasn’t easy, but she made it look effortless.

'1920873342661185827',"Each week, we honor members of our community who go above and beyond—who lead with purpose and inspire with action. Today, we shine a spotlight on a young woman whose brilliance, resilience, and heart have made history. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: @BensalemSchools senior, Victoria Mathieu.
 
At just 18 years old, Tori is blazing a trail—and putting our community on the map. Earlier this month, she became the first Bensalem student ever accepted into five Ivy League universities, part of an extraordinary 14 total college acceptances. Her video capturing the moment went viral—nearly 5 million views—and for good reason. It wasn’t just a celebration of success, but a symbol of what’s possible when hard work, courage, and conviction come together.
 
Beyond her exceptional GPA, Tori has built an academic and service record that speaks volumes. She’s a standout on Bensalem’s Mock Trial Team and founder of her school’s chapter of a global legal honors society. She interned with Legal Aid of Southeastern Pennsylvania, working to expand access to justice for families who too often fall through the cracks. As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Access to Legal Aid Caucus, I know how critical that work is—and the fact that Tori is already leading in this space before she’s even graduated high school is nothing short of extraordinary.
 
Her leadership extends well beyond the classroom. Tori serves as a student representative on the Bensalem School Board, giving her peers a voice in shaping their education. She founded and captains the high school’s Step Dance Team, leads the Reading Olympics Team, and serves as a Pennsylvania Global Ambassador for ReSoap—a youth-led nonprofit combating hygiene poverty and climate change. She’s a proud member of DECA, preparing for a future in business and innovation. And through Still I Shine, the virtual support group she founded, she’s created a space for students across our region to connect, support each other, and feel seen. Tori’s story is a testament to the power of opportunity—and what’s possible when talent is matched by character, conviction, and community values.
 
Her father, Pierre, came to the United States from Haiti at 18. Her mother, Tina, immigrated from Nigeria at 10. Together, they believed in the promise of this country—that through hard work and education, their children could build a better life. Their daughter is living proof of that promise in action. She’s not just walking through doors—she’s holding them open for others.
 
We are incredibly lucky to have a young woman like Victoria Mathieu representing our community. Tori, congratulations on all you’ve achieved—you have an entire community cheering you on! We’re proud.

This week: the Bipartisan PFAS Task Force.

As Co-Chair and Founding Member, I’m leading a national, bipartisan effort to confront the PFAS crisis head-on—because no one should have to question whether their water, homes, or schools are safe.

Today, I officially relaunched the Task Force for the 119th Congress and welcomed new Co-Chairs: @RepDebDingell, @RepJenKiggans, & @repkmr. Together, we’re turning PFAS issues into action.

Here’s how we’re advancing this mission: ⬇️

✔️ Driving bipartisan legislation like the PFAS-Free Procurement Act, which I just introduced last week to reduce harmful chemical exposure by prohibiting federal contracts for products containing PFOS and PFOA
✔️ Securing historic federal investments in PFAS research, remediation, and prevention
✔️ Educating Congress and the public on the severe health and environmental risks 
✔️ Holding polluters accountable and pushing for comprehensive cleanup
✔️ Protecting communities across the country, where families have lived in danger for far too long

'1918342684290215944',"Each week, we share stories from across our district of individuals whose embody the spirit of service, leadership, and community. This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of a true Hometown Hero—the late Jack Erickson of Newtown, whom we sadly lost at the end of March. 

Jack did not just live in our community—he helped shape it. For 96 remarkable years, he led with strength, purpose, and a commitment to serving others. A proud @USArmy veteran, Eagle Scout, and nationally awarded photographer, including a first-place honor from the National Press Photo Association in 1951, Jack captured history through his lens, photographing icons like Marilyn Monroe and President Truman. But his greatest legacy wasn’t who he photographed—it was how he lifted those around him. 

Following his military service, Jack built a successful business career, serving as Eastern Regional Sales Manager for Staley Manufacturing Company and later as President of the Bucks County Board of REALTORS Sales Division. However, his commitment to public service is what made the deepest and most lasting impact. Jack spent more than three decades helping preserve the history of Upper Makefield as a longtime member of the Historical Architectural Review Board. He twice led the Washington Crossing Rotary Club, lived out the motto “Service Above Self,” helped launch the local Kiwanis Club, and served as president of the Pennsbury Scholarship Foundation, opening doors of opportunity for generations of students. He was also a proud 40-year member of the Newtown Reliance Company—helping keep local traditions alive. 

Jack was a leader, a mentor, and a loyal friend. Whether championing education, supporting local preservation, or simply showing up when it mattered most, embodying his values through action. Although he never sought attention, he earned the admiration and gratitude of an entire community. At age 90, he was named Newtown’s Aging Athlete of the Year, a testament to the energy and spirit that defined him. Even later in life, he greeted each day with joy and optimism. When asked how he was doing, he would flash a grin and say, “Near perfect.” 

We extend our deepest condolences to his family and the many friends and neighbors whose lives he touched. Jack showed us what it means to live a life of service, purpose, and joy. May we honor him not just with our words but by following his example—lifting others, showing up, and giving our best to the place we call home.",en,Tweet,1,15,1,2,1248,2025-05-02 17:31:51,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1918342559744552960/vid/avc1/1080x1350/IBAncG8dh64vJ4DI.mp4?tag=16

At the heart of our discussion was the urgent need to align Ukraine’s economic recovery with global security—and that meant locking in a strategic minerals partnership to power both.

'1915801297657143671',"Each week, we share stories of people across our district who rise above the ordinary and inspire us with their courage, compassion, and quiet strength. Today, we honor a woman whose leadership and service have shaped the very foundation of emergency care in Bucks County. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: Barbara Stebulis, of Warminster, Paramedic Chief and Executive Director of Upper Bucks Regional EMS, Inc.
 
Barbara began her career as a teacher at Hatboro-Horsham High School. But it was through EMS that she found her life’s calling—and for over 40 years, she has answered that call with unwavering devotion. As a Paramedic, educator, mentor, and trailblazer, she has not only saved lives—she has built a legacy.
 
She helped establish the Upper Bucks Chiefs Association and, alongside the late John Costello, helped unite the EMS communities of Upper and Lower Bucks, bringing strength through collaboration. Today, under her leadership, UBREMS remains a vital lifeline for nine Bucks County municipalities, responding to emergencies where others can’t—on hiking trails, in remote woodlands, and along the water.
 
And Barbara doesn’t just lead from behind a desk—she leads with her hands, heart, and instinct to serve. While visiting a park in Northampton Township with her son Michael, a paramedic, they witnessed a man collapse on a nearby basketball court. Without hesitation, they rushed to his side, performed CPR, and delivered a lifesaving shock with an AED. It was quick, seamless, and second nature—because saving lives is who they are.
 
That instinct to serve is deeply personal for Barbara. After the heartbreaking loss of her son Brett—a sixth-generation firefighter with dreams of becoming a police officer—Barbara and her husband Lenny turned their grief into purpose. In his memory, they became tireless advocates for the Gift of Life Foundation, raising countless funds and awareness for organ and tissue donation. Out of unimaginable loss, they built something powerful: a mission rooted in compassion and a legacy of healing that continues to touch lives.
 
When asked what keeps her going after four decades of service, Barbara answered with quiet grace, “To hopefully leave things here a little better than we found them.”
 
She has done just that—and so much more.
 
As a certified EMT and Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I will always fight to ensure heroes like Barbara—and the extraordinary team at UBREMS—have the resources, support, and recognition they deserve. Because when someone in our community is in need, they never hesitate. And neither will I.
 
Barbara Stebulis has served with courage, led with heart, and lifted our community time and again. We are safer, stronger, and better because of her. Thank you, Barbara.

Their courage lit the path to independence—and their legacy still lights the way. The Battles of Lexington and Concord endure as a testament to American resilience and a reminder of the extraordinary things that happen when we stand together. 

As part of our #America250 initiative, I’m proud to lead local efforts to honor our community’s vital role in America’s founding. I encourage every member of our community to take part—share your stories, bring your ideas, and let’s honor our past and celebrate our great nation together.

'1913273738365108455',"Each week, we honor members of our community whose strength, compassion, and resilience make a lasting impact. Today, we recognize a family whose faith carried them through the unimaginable—and who have turned that journey into a mission to serve others. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: the Masciantonio family of Warrington.
 
Shortly after Gianna Grace Masciantonio was born, her parents, Joe and Kristen, were told she had only weeks to live. An inoperable tumor had wrapped around her brainstem—aggressive, untreatable, and fatal. With no options left, they turned to the only thing they had—faith. And on Christmas Eve, their prayers were answered. A call from a specialist brought a new possibility: the tumor might not be cancer. A biopsy confirmed it—Gianna had a rare blood disorder known as systemic JXG. The road ahead would be grueling—20 surgeries, intense chemotherapy, and months in the hospital—but their faith held firm.
 
It was their faith that gave them strength through surgeries and long hospital stays, and it was faith that brought them to Philadelphia in 2015 to be near Pope Francis as he visited the city for the World Family. In a moment neither planned nor imagined, Gianna was lifted into the arms of the Holy Father and kissed on the head. For the Masciantonios, it wasn’t just a blessing but a sign they were not walking this road alone.
 
Today, Gianna is a thriving 10-year-old with a heart as big as her smile. She loves art, baking, horseback riding, and time spent with her cousins and classmates. But more than anything, she loves life. Every moment with her is a reminder of how precious and miraculous each day truly is. And her parents—Joe and Kristen—have taken their family’s deepest pain and turned it into a mission of purpose.
 
After enduring unimaginable challenges, they made a promise to help other families facing similar battles with rare and life-threatening pediatric illnesses. This promise led to the creation of the For the Love of Grace Foundation—a nonprofit organization grounded in faith, compassion, and action. Since its founding, For the Love of Grace has donated nearly $100,000 to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and provided life-changing support to countless local families. Their assistance includes covering medical bills, funding essential home modifications, and creating prayer groups for parents seeking strength and connection. Their motto, Faith Over Fear, is more than just a phrase; it embodies how they live, lead, and uplift others.  
 
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Rare Disease Caucus, I am humbled to work alongside families like the Masciantonios. Their courage is our call to action—to secure more funding, research, and resources for children and families fighting rare diseases.
 
Joe, Kristen, and Gianna Grace—your faith, strength, and generosity have illuminated the way for countless individuals and continue to make a difference in our community and beyond. Thank you for reminding us that even in the darkest times, faith triumphs over fear—you are true hometown heroes, and we are grateful for you!",en,Tweet,2,38,5,4,12318,2025-04-18 17:49:40,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Go1QUqNXkAAXTyZ.jpg

'1910721959811227900',"Each week, we share stories from across our district that celebrate the extraordinary individuals who uplift our community with compassion, resilience, and heart. Today, we honor a young girl whose bravery has sparked a movement, whose smile has lifted thousands, and whose spirit reminds us what true courage looks like. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: 13-year-old Lily Tomlinson of Pipersville.
 
In December, Lily was diagnosed with DIPG, a rare and aggressive brain tumor. Just weeks earlier, she was a healthy, active middle schooler—earning high honors, creating art, reading books, laughing with friends, and doting on her little brother, Luca. Then, without warning, came a diagnosis no family is ever prepared to hear.
 
But even in the face of such devastating news, Lily's beautiful spirit continues to shine with hope, heart, and resilience.
 
With a Taylor Swift blanket tucked around her legs, a sticker of her favorite animal—a black cat—on her cheek, and a soft smile that says more than words ever could, Lily lifts her left hand high and offers a thumbs up.
 
“A thumbs up means I can still hold my hand up,” she says. “I’m doing good. Just smile and wave, boys, smile and wave.”
 
That is Lily. Brave. Brilliant. Unbreakably positive. Even as her illness has progressed and she has lost the use of her right side, she has kept her sense of humor: “I’m a lefty anyway.” Her positivity isn’t just admirable—it’s transformative. It’s touched her classmates, our community, and a world of strangers who now carry her story in their hearts.
 
In the months following her diagnosis, Lily’s light has reached far beyond Bucks County. She’s united everyone from neighbors here in PA-1 to Swifties around the world, who have rallied around her with messages of love, strength, and solidarity. What began as a fight for one young girl has become a testament to the power of positivity in the face of unimaginable difficulty.
 
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Rare Disease Caucus, I’m fighting to bring more attention, funding, and hope to families like Lily’s. But Lily is already teaching us what no policy ever could—how to live with purpose and find happiness even in the most difficult moments.
 
When asked what she wants her parents to know, Lily’s answer was simple—and unforgettable: “That I’ll always be with them.”
 
Lily, your strength humbles us. Your joy inspires us. And your light continues to guide this community and beyond.

Thank you to my friends, President Sean McGarvey, Secretary-Treasurer Brandon Bishop, and the entire NABTU leadership for your leadership, your friendship, and your loyalty.  

I led the charge to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and I’m co-leading the PRO Act and the National Apprenticeship Act—because fair wages, safe job sites, and the right to organize aren’t partisan values. They’re American values.

When labor leads, America moves forward.

His project is thoughtful, forward-looking, and rooted in the idea that an informed community is a stronger one.

But what impressed me most wasn’t just the technology—it was the heart behind it. In talking with Ayush, it’s clear he’s thinking not just about coding and innovation, but about how to bring people together, create opportunity, and make a difference.

During today’s @WaysandMeansGOP hearing, I had the opportunity to speak with US Trade Representative  Jamieson Greer. It was a chance to reinforce the importance of taking tangible steps toward equitable trade practices, which will benefit the economy and ensure a fiscally prosperous future for all Americans.

As we work to strike a balance between long-term economic growth and addressing the immediate concerns of everyday citizens—whether at the supermarket, hardware store, pharmacy, or restaurant—it’s essential to consider the potential impact on the most vulnerable populations. These groups are at risk of significant hardship if the prices of life-saving drugs and medical devices rise.

A key component of securing America’s future is closing the loopholes that enable adversaries like the People’s Republic of China to exploit the de minimis process, allowing the illegal flow of dangerous synthetic opioids like fentanyl into our communities. We cannot, and will not, tolerate trade partners taking advantage of our good faith efforts.

'1910029711834521810',"If you’ve ever unrolled a yoga mat, opened a phone case, or handled foam insulation, you’ve likely come into contact with azodicarbonamide (ADA)—an industrial chemical used to make plastic products light, foamy, and flexible.
 
But what most people don’t realize is that ADA is also being added to our food—especially bread, bagels, and other baked goods.
 
ADA is used in the plastics industry as a chemical foaming agent, creating an airy texture in everything from gym mats to sneakers. The food industry adopted it to do the same for dough: make it easier to process and puffier when baked. 
 
While over 30 countries, including the UK, Australia, and the EU, have banned ADA in food due to concerns about respiratory issues and cancer-causing byproducts, the U.S. still allows it.
 
Why This Matters:

🚨ADA is not a food—it’s a plastic additive.
🚨 When heated, it can form urethane, a compound linked to cancer and other harmful diseases. 
🚨 The World Health Organization has flagged it for as substance of concern.
🚨 Children are most at risk due to their developing systems
 
How to Protect Your Family:

✅ Read labels & avoid products that list azodicarbonamide or ADA.
✅ Support efforts to ban non-food chemicals from our food supply—ADA belongs in gym bags, not lunchboxes.
 
If countries around the world have banned this industrial additive, why are we still feeding it to our kids? The food industry shouldn’t get a pass on using chemicals meant for plastic. It’s time for accountability and higher standards.
 
Stay informed. Spread the word. And join me in calling for safer, smarter food policies.

America has always stood with those who stand for liberty. That must never change. Our strength as a nation isn’t just in our power—but in our principles.

We must continue building a strategic partnership with Pakistan, one rooted in shared democratic values and a clear commitment to human rights. When we stand with those who fight for freedom, we reaffirm what it means to be a leader on the world stage.

At today’s @WaysandMeansGOP Health Subcommittee Hearing on Lowering Costs for Patients, I continued advocating for solutions that increase access and affordability—like expanding the use of biosimilars.

Biosimilars are safe, effective alternatives to costly biologics and could dramatically reduce out-of-pocket expenses. But despite their promise, outdated Medicare reimbursement policies and a lack of provider incentives have slowed their adoption.

Improving Medicare’s Part B payment model is a targeted, bipartisan solution that would help increase biosimilar use, reduce costs, and ensure more patients benefit from the full range of available therapies.

Patients shouldn’t have to choose between access and affordability. We can and must do both.

@BiotechnologyPa is more than a regional asset—it’s a nationally recognized leader in advancing medical research, developing life-saving treatments, and driving public health innovation. The loss of critical funding would disrupt promising work already underway and delay breakthroughs that patients across the country are counting on.

I am calling on NIH leadership to provide transparency around the grant cancellation process and to fully consider the long-term impact these decisions will have on public health, medical progress, and regional economies.

To Jeff Caballero: Congratulations on receiving this year’s Community Leadership Award! Your lifetime of advocacy has lifted up underserved communities and brought critical attention to the fight against hepatitis B and liver cancer.

I’ve been proud to support your work in Washington—and I will continue to fight alongside you: to expand access, confront disparities, invest in research, and ensure that hepatitis B is no longer a silent crisis, but a solvable one.

Catholic Social Services is far more than a provider of care—it is a pillar of strength for individuals and families facing some of life’s most difficult challenges. Their work is rooted in faith and guided by the belief that every person deserves dignity, respect, and hope.

They’ve shaped my life and continue to guide my work in Congress—where I remain committed to ensuring that organizations like CHS are recognized and supported, so they can continue expanding their reach and deepening their impact.

'1908191007793094931',"Each week, we share remarkable stories from across our district of people who reflect the highest ideals of service, character, and devotion to others. Today, we honor one such man: a true hometown hero, Edward C. Wallace, whom we sadly lost last week. Ed was a proud Marine, police officer, and, above all, a man whose life was rooted in unwavering commitment—to country, community, and family.
 
Raised in Croydon and a resident of Levittown for over 45 years, Ed made every place he touched better. Humble in presence yet profound in impact, he lived with sincerity, strength, and a heart for service. As a young man, Ed answered his country’s call, enlisting in the @USMC and serving with distinction in the Vietnam War. He rose to the rank of Sergeant and received numerous military honors—including the Vietnam Service Medal with Two Stars, the National Defense Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, and the Rifle Expert Badge.
 
After returning home, Ed continued to serve—spending over two decades with the @BristolTwpPD and later with the Tullytown Police. For Ed, service wasn’t a duty. It was who he was.

A proud Irish-American and member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Ed honored his heritage through fellowship and tradition. Later in life, he taught himself to play the bagpipes—an act of reverence he used to honor others during parades, funerals, and ceremonies. Through music, as in life, Ed served with quiet dignity and deep respect.
 
Just a few weeks ago, I had the profound honor of spending time with Ed and witnessing the presentation of his Quilt of Valor—a national expression of gratitude for those who have borne the burdens of war. As the quilt was laid upon him, it was clear we weren’t just honoring his service—but the spirit in which he lived: selflessly, humbly, and with enduring grace.
 
To his beloved wife Sharon, his children, grandchildren, and all who knew him—our community grieves with you. We are forever grateful for Ed’s life, service, and enduring example.

May God bless the memory of Ed Wallace—a patriot, a protector, and a true hometown hero.",en,Tweet,1,7,0,2,1279,2025-04-04 17:12:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GntBmyyXMAA-1k4.jpg

Since coming to Congress, I’ve worked closely with my friends at the @LCVoters to turn our shared priorities into real outcomes. Together, we helped pass the Great American Outdoors Act—my landmark legislation that permanently funded the Land and Water Conservation Fund and addressed long-overdue maintenance in our national parks.

In February, I introduced the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program Reauthorization Act of 2025 to extend a proven federal initiative that protects clean water, strengthens local economies, and safeguards the long-term health of our communities. Every federal dollar invested yields exponential returns—restoring ecosystems, creating jobs, and building climate resilience throughout the region.

Right now, outdated SSI rules punish low-income seniors and people with disabilities for saving responsibly—forcing them to choose between building a better future and keeping the benefits they depend on.

We’re fixing that. 

Our bill:

✅ Raises asset limits from $2,000 to $10,000 for individuals
✅ Raises limits from $3,000 to $20,000 for married couples
✅ Indexes these limits to inflation permanently

We support efforts to improve government efficiency—but applying sweeping national security exemptions to agencies like SSA, FCC, GSA, and HHS risks doing more harm than good. These agencies are vital to public service. Undermining collective bargaining in these spaces weakens morale, accountability, and performance.

That’s why, alongside this letter, I introduced the Protect America’s Workforce Act with @RepGolden. This bipartisan bill restores a responsible, targeted approach—preserving bargaining rights and reinforcing the role that the worker’s voice plays in strengthening government.

I sat down with Jennifer Statler of the @PSEA and an incredible group of constituents educators from Pennsbury, Council Rock, Central Bucks, and school districts across our region. They shared powerful, firsthand insight into the challenges they face every day—underfunded classrooms, teacher shortages, the growing mental health crisis among students, early literacy gaps, and the importance of reliable school meals.

These aren’t abstract policy issues—they’re real, urgent, and deeply personal. And they’re exactly the kind of challenges I’m working to address in Congress.

Our district is home to some of the best educators and schools in the country, and I’ll keep doing everything I can to support them—with the resources, respect, and results they deserve.

'1905661686582743258',"Each week, we honor individuals from across our district whose lives reflect the very best of who we are. This week, we shine a light on a man whose journey is a testament to faith in action and leadership through service. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: Donald Schuler Jr. of Lower Makefield.
 
Raised by two pastors—Donald and Dawn—faith and service were a constant part of his upbringing. From a young age, Don was taught true purpose is found in helping others and living with intention. That foundation would guide every step of his journey.
 
Don’s path of purpose began at Pennsbury High School, where he was known as a thoughtful leader and someone who was looked up to by others. He served as a Student Council senator, played football, volunteered as a Pop Warner coach, and gave countless hours to his community, volunteering and striving to make a difference wherever he could. In 2006, he was named YMCA Youth Volunteer of the Year and received a Senatorial Citation for his service—early signs of a young man committed to leading by example.
 
Don's journey took him from the hallways of Pennsbury to the national stage. A dynamic leader and creative voice, his career has spanned industries and inspired audiences nationwide. As an Executive Success Coach, motivational speaker, and innovative storyteller, Don has partnered with major brands such as Google, Verizon, Budweiser, Campbell’s, and the NBA—bringing his message of purpose and empowerment to corporate, educational, and community spaces alike. He has delivered TEDx talks, led national speaking tours, and motivated thousands of students to believe in themselves and their potential.
 
Through it all, one thing remained clear: Don’s heart never left the community that raised him.
 
Today, Don has come home to serve as the Youth Ministries Pastor at The Crossing Church in Washington Crossing. In his newest role, through mentorship, ministry, and everyday presence, Don is helping our students discover who they are, grow in their faith, and realize the power of living with intention. He's not just encouraging them to find their purpose—he’s walking alongside them as they do.
 
In a world where our young people are bombarded with a multitude of distractions, Don is a steady, guiding voice—helping them build confidence, character, and a foundation of faith that will carry them into lives of meaning and service.
 
Don's return is more than a homecoming—it is a fulfillment of a calling. His life is a powerful reminder that our greatest purpose is found in what we give back, and for Don, that purpose is clear: to lead, to serve, and to help young people discover their purpose, grow in their faith, and give back to the communities that raised them.
 
Please join me in celebrating this remarkable man for his outstanding service, his unwavering dedication to our next generation, and the inspiring example he sets for us all—thank you, Don, for all you do!",en,Tweet,0,4,1,3,858,2025-03-28 16:42:06,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnJFM_3W0AAY8tX.jpg

We focused on two major priorities: the shortage of healthcare professionals and the need to expand access to telehealth. These issues go hand in hand, and addressing them is essential to strengthening care in our community and nationwide.
 
That’s why I’m advancing bipartisan solutions like the Telehealth Expansion Act, which would give over 32 million Americans with high-deductible plans access to virtual care, and the Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act of 2025, to give providers the stability they need to continue serving patients effectively.
 
I’m grateful to Dr. Goldman, Danielle, and Surali for their insights and the work they're doing in our community.

This loophole is costing American jobs, undercutting U.S. businesses, and eroding the integrity of our supply chains.
 
This week, I met with James Marcum, CEO of @davidsbridal, and Richard Westenberger, CEO of @Carters—two leaders on the front lines of this crisis. We had a productive, solution-driven conversation about the urgent need to reform this broken system and protect American businesses from being squeezed out of their own market.

'1904929399746814256',"At this morning’s Intelligence Committee Worldwide Threats hearing with the Heads of the Intelligence Community, I spoke about the critical need to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)—a top national security priority I’ve championed throughout my career in the FBI and now in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

Section 702 is the single most critical national security tool we have to detect and disrupt terrorist plots, cyberattacks, and hostile actions by foreign adversaries. Its reauthorization isn’t optional—it’s essential. Failure to act would leave our nation and allies blind to imminent threats, both at home and abroad.

Both @FBIDirectorKash and @CIADirector John Ratcliffe reaffirmed the importance of this authority, highlighting the very real consequences of inaction.

What makes Diane’s story extraordinary is not only the breadth of her service—but also the courage with which she continues it. Even now, in the face of unimaginable adversity, as she battles stage IV pancreatic cancer, she continues to serve with grace, humility, and purpose.
 
Of all her contributions, her work with our nation’s veterans speaks most powerfully to the depth of her character. In a world where invisible wounds often go unseen, Diane chose to see them—and to act. Together with Vietnam War hero Captain David A. Christian, she co-founded Victor Six Health and Fitness Organization, a groundbreaking program built on a simple but profound belief: restoring the body can help restore the mind.
 
What began as an idea rooted in compassion has become a lifeline for hundreds of veterans struggling with the weight of trauma. Through this program, veterans not only regain their physical strength but reconnect with hope, purpose, and life itself. The result is nothing short of extraordinary: since its founding, not one participant has taken their own life.
 
Diane’s impact transcends statistics. It lives in the veterans who now stand with renewed strength, in the families who have found healing and wholeness, and in the countless individuals who feel seen, heard, and uplifted because she chose to walk beside them. She has become a quiet force of hope in our community—a steadfast reminder of what it truly means to live a life of purpose, compassion, and unwavering service to others.
 
Thank you, Diane, for the example you’ve set and the lives you’ve touched and saved. Our community is better, kinder, and stronger because of you. You are, in every sense, a true Hometown Hero.",en,Tweet,0,5,1,3,945,2025-03-21 15:55:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gmk3TbJWoAA299R.jpg
'1902518928418496894',"The Sunoco/Energy Transfer pipeline leak in Upper Makefield has raised serious concerns about public health, environmental safety, and regulatory oversight. While PADEP has responded to some inquiries, critical questions remain unanswered—questions that demand immediate and thorough responses.

As I continue working alongside the dedicated residents of the Upper Makefield Task Force and in addition to my calls for PHMSA to temporarily shut down the pipeline, I am once again calling on PADEP Acting Secretary Jessica Shirley to provide greater accountability, independent oversight, and a firm commitment to full environmental remediation.

Among the most pressing questions PADEP must answer:

✔️ Why is PADEP downplaying public concerns about MTBE, Lead, and VOCs? Any level of contamination—especially near a nearly 70-year-old petroleum pipeline—should be treated as a serious risk.

✔️ Why is Energy Transfer’s own contractor conducting the testing? Independent, third-party verification is essential to ensuring public trust and accurate results.

✔️ Why hasn’t PADEP required full environmental restoration? A pipeline leak of this magnitude demands more than minimal compliance—it requires a complete and thorough cleanup.

PADEP must act decisively to protect residents and hold Energy Transfer fully accountable. Our community deserves transparency and real solutions, not delays or half-measures. I will keep pushing until we get the accountability this situation demands.

🚨 This Week’s Focus: High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS)

Europe has banned or restricted HFCS due to its links to childhood obesity, Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and cognitive impairment. Yet, it is still flooding our food here in the U.S.—posing serious health risks, particularly for children.
 
HFCS disrupts insulin regulation, increasing the risk of early-onset Type 2 diabetes in children at alarming rates while also overloading the liver, contributing to the surge in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)—now affecting approximately 1 in 10 children.
 
Even more alarming? HFCS doesn’t just affect the body—it interferes with brain function. As HFCS consumption has increased, so have ADHD diagnoses, with studies linking it to hyperactivity, attention deficits, and cognitive impairment, making it harder for children to focus, learn, and regulate their behavior. Some sources have even tested positive for mercury contamination—a neurotoxin known to damage developing brains.

This week, we shine a light on an incredible man shaping the minds of the next generation, fostering curiosity, and inspiring a lifelong love of discovery—meet this week's Hometown Hero, Dave Curry.
 
For 33 years, Dave Curry has done more than teach Earth and space science—he has transformed how students experience it. As an educator at Newtown Middle School in the Council Rock School District, he has made geoscience not just a subject, but an adventure—one that empowers young minds to see the world differently, think critically, and explore with purpose. His extraordinary commitment to innovation and excellence in science education has earned him the prestigious 2025 American Geosciences Institute’s National Edward C. Roy Jr. Award for Excellence in K-8 Earth Science Teaching, a national recognition that reflects his profound impact on the field.
 
Dave's innovative approach to education is best exemplified by the multi-month, computer-based lab exercise he developed, which builds on NASA’s Sally Ride EarthKAM program. Through this immersive, hands-on experience, his students don't just learn about the Earth—they become scientists, working with real satellite imagery and data to study weather systems, geologic processes, coastal erosion, and plate tectonics. They analyze how natural forces shape the planet, engage in the same methodologies used by geoscientists, and discover firsthand how science can solve real-world problems.
 
This is the power of a truly exceptional educator—one who doesn’t just teach facts but opens doors to possibility and excitement. Dave's students see themselves in the work of scientists, engineers, and innovators. They aren’t just absorbing knowledge; they’re developing the skills, confidence, and curiosity that will lead them to shape the future.
 
Beyond the classroom, Curry’s passion for science education knows no bounds. His leadership as a mentor for the American Meteorological Society’s DataStreme graduate courses, his role as a science fair sponsor, and his deep engagement in professional organizations reflect his unwavering dedication to ensuring students have access to the very best in Earth and space science education.
 
Our teachers are heroes; they are the architects of the future and the catalysts of discovery. At a time when our nation faces a growing teacher shortage, the need for passionate, innovative, and skilled educators has never been more critical. The success of our next generation hinges on the excellence, dedication, and mentorship of educators like Dave Curry—those who go beyond the curriculum to ignite imaginations, fuel ambition, and shape the scientists, problem-solvers, and visionaries of tomorrow.
 
Please join me in congratulating Dave on the well-deserved recognition of his work, and thanking him, along with all our dedicated PA-1 teachers, for their selfless efforts in guiding our next generation of leaders.

'1899802075241824592',"At yesterday’s @WaysandMeansGOP Health Subcommittee Hearing on After the Hospital: Ensuring Access to Quality Post-Acute Care, I highlighted a critical issue facing our PA-1 community: a severe shortage of healthcare staff. This crisis is leaving our patients without care or care that falls short of their needs. Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) are being hit hardest, with Pennsylvania projected to face the most severe staffing shortage by 2026, and half our state’s healthcare providers planning to close or sell at least 1 of their SNF locations this year.

I turned to Dr. Dana Madison, DNP, MBA, BSN, RN of Compassion Home Health Care, to share how staffing shortages have impacted patient care. She emphasized the critical role telehealth can play in bridging this gap. Telehealth has already begun to transform healthcare, making it more accessible for patients while easing the burden on providers. We must expand, not limit, access to this vital tool.

That’s why I introduced the Telehealth Expansion Act of 2025. This bipartisan legislation will allow over 32 million Americans with High-Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to access telehealth services before meeting their deductible—giving families the care they need when they need it most.

The proposed Wastewater Treatment Plant that was slated to be managed by the Newtown Bucks County Joint Municipal Authority has officially been PAUSED and WILL NOT proceed forward at this moment. Much work remains, but this is a positive development.  

In response to overwhelming public concern, the board has committed to exploring alternative uses for the land, ensuring that any future development reflects the best interests of our community. In February, I called on Acting DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley to conduct a thorough review of this project’s environmental, zoning, and quality-of-life impacts.

Today, I once again called on PHMSA Acting Administrator Ben Kochman to address these concerns with urgency and provide full documentation. The integrity of this pipeline, the safety of our families, and the protection of our natural resources are non-negotiable.

Among the critical questions raised:

✔️ What led triggered Sunoco to install Type A sleeves in the 1990s on the Twin Oaks pipeline?

✔️ Can PHMSA provide evidence that Sunoco has comprehensive and effective emergency response plans to adequately protect densely populated residential areas and critical natural resources in the event of a major pipeline failure?

✔️ What enhanced preventative measures have been implemented in high-risk residential areas?

✔️ What threshold must be met for PHMSA to mandate a pipeline shutdown, and how close is Sunoco’s pipeline to that threshold?

Upper Makefield residents deserve clear answers, real oversight, and stronger enforcement to protect their homes and environment. PHMSA must act now. I will always fight to protect our home, and continue pushing until we get the transparency and accountability our community deserves.

But every so often, a story emerges that speaks to something even greater—the quiet power of instinct, the courage found in the unexpected, and the steadfast presence of those who rise to meet the moment when it matters most.

As we approach International Women’s Day, we celebrate the women who keep our communities, our families, and our world moving forward—not with fanfare but with unwavering resolve. And this week, we recognize one such woman—a nurse whose quick thinking and steady hands turned what could have been a crisis into a moment of grace. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero—Stephanie Frisco, a school nurse in the @Neshaminy_SD.
 
Last Thursday began like any other at Walter S. Miller Elementary School in Levittown—hallways filled with eager students, teachers shaping young minds, and the steady rhythm of a school day unfolding. But for Genevieve Peto, a devoted educator and expectant mother, the day would take a turn for which no lesson plan could have prepared her.
 
In moments like these, there is no time for hesitation—no second chances, no margin for error. With the steady confidence that defines true heroes, Stephanie assessed the situation, understood the urgency, and took command. There was no hospital. No team of doctors. Just the four walls of a school nurse’s office and a woman who refused to let uncertainty stand in her way. And in just ten minutes, despite never having delivered a child before, Stephanie helped Genevieve bring baby Cora safely into the world. A moment that could have ended in crisis became a story of courage, instinct, and grace under pressure.
 
Genevieve understands how easily that day could have taken a different turn. But when she looks back, it’s not with fear—it’s with profound gratitude. ""She really was an angel, truly. We're beyond thankful.""
 
What happened that day was more than a remarkable moment—it was a testament to the women who, day after day, step up, lean in, and do what needs to be done. We see it in the halls of our schools, where teachers like Genevieve shape the next generation with patience and wisdom.We see it in the hands of nurses like Stephanie, whose instincts and composure turn the unexpected into the extraordinary. We see it in mothers, daughters, sisters, and leaders—in the women who make the world work, often without fanfare, always with resilience.
 
Tomorrow, we celebrate International Women’s Day—but every day, we honor the Stephanie Friscos and Genevieve Petos of the world—the women whose strength, skill, and resolve keep our families, our communities, and our country moving forward. So today, let's applaud Stephanie for her quick thinking and steady hands, congratulate Genevieve, welcome baby Cora into a world made stronger by women like them, and celebrate the countless women in PA-1 and beyond who show us, time and again, what true resilience looks like.",en,Tweet,1,10,1,4,1666,2025-03-07 17:12:37,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GldCzSQXUAAKa2W.jpg

Prevention starts with knowledge, which is why I l launched The Wellness Watch—a new series designed to help families make safer choices, safeguard their health, and demand better from the products we rely on every day.

⚠️ How to Avoid This Hidden Danger:

🔎 Check labels—avoid products that contain Potassium Bromate or Bromated Flour.

🥖 Choose safer options—purchase organic, fresh, or locally baked bread without additives. Support small, local bakeries!

Among 3,000 elite athletes and 75,000 cheering fans, he will step onto the national stage, the product of years of grit, sacrifice, and determination.

As Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Congressional Pre-K & Child Care Caucus, I’ve worked closely with Valerie on addressing these critical issues in our PA-1 community, and her insights have been invaluable. Families in our community and across the nation are struggling, spending nearly  24% of their income on child care. 

That is why, last week, I introduced the Affordable Child Care Act—bipartisan legislation that doubles three key tax credits, puts money back in parents’ pockets, supports our early childhood educators and child care providers , and ensures every family has access to quality, affordable care.

No parent should be forced to choose between paying the bills and securing their child’s future. And no early learning or child care provider should struggle to keep their doors open.

A huge thank you to Valerie and all early childhood educators in PA-1 and across the nation for your selfless and important work shaping the next generation.

Since then, I have been working closely with the @PennsylvaniaDEP, @PHMSA_DOT, @SecDuffy, and local officials to demand answers, accountability, and immediate action.

While PHMSA and the Department of Transportation have been engaged, our community still lacks full transparency and certainty. Families should not have to wonder whether their water is safe, and no pipeline should continue operating when fundamental safety concerns remain unresolved.

That is why today, alongside @SenFettermanPA, I am calling on PHMSA Acting Administrator Ben Kochman to keep the pipeline fully offline until a comprehensive investigation is complete, every corrective measure is implemented, and it is definitively proven no further risks remain.

'1893999110648217682',"Today, we unequivocally and unapologetically reaffirm, to the United States of America and to the World, the following undeniable and indisputable facts. We ask all Americans, including all elected officials from all Parties and all levels of Government, to join us by sharing and reposting this message for the World to see:

🇺🇸 Three years ago today, Vladimir Putin illegally invaded Ukraine without justification and without provocation.  

🇺🇸 The United States of America stands for the Rule of Law, and respects and defends the borders and territorial sovereignty of all Freedom-Loving Nations.  

🇺🇸 Ukraine is an independent, sovereign, and freedom-loving nation, and is an ally of the United States of America and the Free World.  

🇺🇸 Vladimir Putin, through his illegal invasions, genocide, kidnapping, rape, torture and murder of innocent civilians, including women and children, is an enemy of the United States of America and the Free World.  

🇺🇸 The United States of America stands with Democracies and opposes Dictatorships.

🇺🇸 Volodymyr Zelenskyy is the Legitimately Elected President of Ukraine through a free and fair election.  

🇺🇸 Vladimir Putin is an Unelected Dictator who imprisons his political opponents and who has never held a free and fair election.  

🇺🇸 The Ukrainian election has been delayed because Ukraine is under daily relentlessly bombings, over 200 per day, by Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine is in a State of 24/7 Martial Law.  

🇺🇸 Ukraine will hold their elections as soon as Vladimir Putin stops his unprovoked, unjustified daily bombings inside Ukraine. 

🇺🇸 If Putin is rewarded for his illegal invasion and genocide, this will serve as a green-light incentive to other Dictators, such as CCP Chairman Xi Jinping, to pursue their own conquests (i.e. Taiwan), which will lead to more instability across the Globe. 

🇺🇸 Dictators like Vladimir Putin are the Adult Versions of the School Yard Bullies that we all confronted in Grade School. And they must be dealt with in the same exact way. There is Peace through Strength, and there is War through Weakness. There is no magical third option.

'1892985999372014053',"Each week, we share remarkable stories from across our district—stories of people who rise above the ordinary and remind us of the power of kindness, connection, and community. This week, we honor a man who has spent a lifetime doing just that. A man who needs no introduction but certainly deserves our recognition. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: Doug Turner.
 
At 87 years old, Doug Turner has spent his life in service—to his country as a U.S. Army veteran, to our land as a 30-year U.S. Forest Service worker, and to our community as an artist, a storyteller, and a neighbor in the truest sense of the word. Along with his late wife Susan—who served as Newtown Borough Council President—Doug dedicated himself to the town they called home, whether teaching students at Goodnoe Elementary about the importance of trees or helping organize Newtown’s annual Arbor Day celebration. 
 
In 2022, when Doug lost Susan, he found a way to keep their shared spirit of giving alive—by bringing people together. He started hosting an annual winter party, a simple gathering meant to combat the isolation of winter and rekindle the warmth of true neighborly connection. No guest list, no expectations. Just an open door and one request: “Bring only a smile.”
 
This year, however, something remarkable happened. A simple act—an old-fashioned, handwritten, hand-delivered invitation—didn’t just bring together a neighborhood; it brought together the world. Doug's invitation scribbled on a paper snowflake with his signature humor, ""From 4 p.m. to whenever the cops come,” captured hearts from Alaska to Australia. Inspired by Doug, people everywhere started throwing their own neighborhood parties, making a conscious effort to reach out to those around them. What Doug started in his corner of Newtown rippled throughout the world, proving that one person can ignite a movement of kindness—one, in this case, that went viral.
 
So today, we celebrate Doug—not for a viral party, but for showing us that in a world often divided, there is still more that unites us than separates us. For reminding us that we are not just individuals living side by side but neighbors—meant to share in life’s joys, lift each other in hardship, and find strength in one another.
 
Thank you, Doug, for showing us that community is built through kindness, strengthened by connection, and made whole when we come together.",en,Tweet,2,19,1,5,5426,2025-02-21 17:13:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GkU8tE4W8AA3AFs.jpg

Kfir was just nine months old on October 7th. His life—along with so many others—was stolen in an act of unthinkable evil. Their loss is a tragic reminder of the true cost of Hamas’s barbarism. We owe it to the victims and their families to stand unwavering in the pursuit of justice.
 
This is not just Israel’s fight—it is the fight of every nation that upholds freedom, justice, and human dignity. The United States stands unequivocally with Israel—today, tomorrow, and always. Every hostage must be brought home. Every innocent life must be honored. And every terrorist must face the full weight of justice.

'1892553825212404066',"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy need not, and must not, have any deal forced upon him by any outside nation that does not guarantee the security and the sovereignty of the Ukrainian people, the people who elected him with over 73% of the popular vote, in an election that was recognized as free and fair by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), where I served as a Commissioner and Congressional Appointee.  Russia has never held such elections.  

President Zelenskyy, and all negotiators, need to know this:  There is an outcome-determinative number of Members of the United States Congress, from both parties and in both Chambers, who are ready, willing, and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Communist Dictator Vladimir Putin from being rewarded for his illegal invasion, raping, kidnapping, torturing and murdering of the Ukrainian people, including so many women and children.  We will use every lever and every vote at our disposal, regardless of the personal or political consequences.  This matter is that time-sensitive and it is that existential.  It is legacy-defining.  

We all want an immediate end to this brutal Russian invasion and killing.  For a peace agreement to be fair and lasting, it must be done in a way that holds the Russian invaders accountable, protects the dignity of the Ukrainian victims, and provides for fair and equitable cost-sharing amongst all European nations.  To do otherwise would be to encourage future invasions and to perpetuate future heartache and bloodshed.

'1892340331695272273',"Since coming to Congress, I’ve made it my mission to champion the health and well-being of our PA-1 community and the nation as a whole. Beyond pushing for greater transparency and safety in the food and products we rely on, I’m working to advance proactive solutions that empower Americans to take control of their health and prevent disease before it starts.

As part of that effort, I’ve launched The Wellness Watch—a new series dedicated to providing families with the knowledge they need to make safer, healthier choices.

🚨 This Week’s Focus: Walking

Just 30 minutes of walking a day can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of chronic disease, improve mental well-being, and even add years to your life. Movement isn’t just beneficial—it’s one of the most effective and affordable tools we have to fight disease and cut long-term healthcare costs.

That’s why I introduced the bipartisan PHIT Act, which allows Americans to use pre-tax HSA and FSA funds for fitness expenses. By making physical activity more accessible, we can reduce healthcare costs, improve health outcomes, and put more money back in taxpayers’ pockets.

Parents with young children are now spending nearly 24% of their income on child care—an unsustainable burden that demands action.
 
That’s why I introduced the bipartisan Affordable Child Care Act—a bold, commonsense plan to deliver real relief to working families by doubling three key tax benefits:
 
✅ Child & Dependent Care Credit: Up to $6,000 for one child, $12,000 for two or more children.

✅ Employer-Provided Child Care Credit: Expands to $300,000 per year to help businesses support working parents.

✅ Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts: Allows families to save up to $10,000 tax-free for child care expenses.

This legislation will:

✅ Invest in local conservation efforts
✅ Improve water quality for millions
✅ Restore vital ecosystems and habitats
✅ Expand outdoor recreation opportunities

Every federal dollar invested generates lasting returns—creating jobs, fortifying communities, and ensuring the Delaware River Basin remains a thriving natural and economic powerhouse for generations to come.

'1890447977749033468',"Each week, we share the remarkable stories of those who have shaped our community through their courage, service, and sacrifice. Today, we recognize a man whose life is not just part of history but has helped define it. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: World War II Veteran Chuck Kunes of Middletown, the last surviving member of the legendary Black Sheep Squadron, who turns 100 years young on February 27th.
 
In 1942, at only 18 years old and the world at war, Chuck bravely stepped forward and proudly answered the call to serve. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and became part of VMF-214, the Black Sheep Squadron—one of the most revered aviation units in military history. Under the fearless leadership of Major Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington, Chuck and his squadron took part in some of the fiercest air battles of the Pacific. As a flight mechanic, his role was vital—ensuring that warplanes were combat-ready, that pilots could return to the skies, and that the fight for freedom would endure. The Black Sheep Squadron became legends, and Chuck stood among them—a young man whose quiet courage and unshakable resolve helped turn the tide of history.
 
When the war ended, Chuck returned home and became one of the original residents of the Stony Brook section of Levittown. Here, he helped shape one of the most special communities in our district—a community where veterans and families built their futures, bound together by the resilience and camaraderie of a generation that had sacrificed so much. For over 40 years, Chuck served as an executive at 3M in Bristol, leading with the same integrity, discipline, and steadfast commitment that had defined his service. His greatest achievement, however, is in the life he built. Alongside his beloved wife, Alma, they raised three wonderful children, instilling the same values of service, sacrifice, and love of community and country.
 
I had the profound honor of celebrating Chuck on his 96th birthday and paying tribute to his extraordinary service in Washington last April. Now, as he nears his 100th birthday, please join me in honoring a life that epitomizes duty, valor, and selfless service. Happy 100th Birthday, Chuck!

On Jan 1, 2025, a 2.83% Medicare reimbursement cut took effect, compounding rising practice costs to an unsustainable 6.43% cut. Medicare physician reimbursement has dropped 33% since 2001, forcing layoffs, reduced services, and closures—especially in rural and underserved areas.

That’s why I proudly joined a bipartisan coalition to pass the HALT Fentanyl Act, a critical measure to:

✅ Permanently classify fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs, closing a loophole that traffickers have exploited for too long.
✅ Strengthen penalties and enforcement to dismantle trafficking networks and disrupt the flow of this lethal poison.
✅ Expand research to better equip law enforcement and medical professionals in combating this epidemic.

This legislation is precise in its approach—it targets traffickers, not users. Allowing temporary scheduling to lapse would mean weaker enforcement, weaker laws, and more lives lost.

This morning, I stood on the floor of the House to honor the life and legacy of a remarkable leader, advocate, and fighter—a true hometown hero—the remarkable Anna Payne, Middletown Supervisor, whom we sadly lost this week.
 
A Levittown native and Neshaminy High School graduate, Anna was more than a public servant—she was a champion for her neighbors, a tireless advocate for the most vulnerable, and a fearless leader who turned her battles into a mission to uplift others. She didn’t just believe in community—she built it, strengthened it, and fought for it every day.
 
Diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at a young age, Anna understood struggle but refused to be defined by it. Instead, it inspired her to work tirelessly to make life better for others. Through her leadership as Vice Chair of the @PARareDisease and as the founder of the Bucks County Cystic Fibrosis Alliance, Anna gave hope to countless families and individuals in our community. As Middletown Township Supervisor, she was a fierce and effective leader, working to make our community stronger, safer, and more connected, championing initiatives that enhanced local infrastructure, protected public safety, and bettered our community.
 
Even after her stage-four colon cancer diagnosis in 2021, Anna never wavered in her commitment to our community. Through unimaginable adversity, she continued showing up—proving time and time again that her dedication, resilience, and heart knew no bounds. Her impact stretched far beyond the halls of government; she was a mentor, a friend, and a guiding light to all who knew her. Through her tireless healthcare advocacy, unwavering commitment to local initiatives, and extraordinary ability to unite people, Anna exemplified the best of Bucks County.
 
Today, we mourn the loss of a true hometown hero, but more importantly,  we celebrate a legacy that will never fade and honor a life of service and unyielding determination.

First, to implement bipartisan “courage metrics” based on actual floor votes, to ensure that bipartisanship and independent voting is a 50-50 two-way street. 

And second, to enshrine mandatory term limits for Caucus leadership, to afford everyone in the Caucus the opportunity to lead and to prevent Caucus “dictatorships.” These two legacy-defining issues have been my #1 priority, to ensure that our 100% focus is on the good of the Caucus, the good of Bipartisanship, and the good of our Country, not the good of the individual.

Meet this week's Hometown Hero—Leah Lovelace-Square, the 2025 Student Leader winner of the @Bucks_edu MLK Leadership Award.
 
A Guided Studies major at BCCC, Leah is pursuing concentrations in Management, Leadership, Entrepreneurship & Business, and Culture & Society—fields that perfectly reflect her commitment to developing future leaders and fostering opportunities for young people in our community.
 
Leah was raised in a military family and their journey took her across four states and three countries. At Baumholder American High School in Germany, she experienced firsthand the life-changing impact of mentorship and leadership programs. What began as an opportunity became a calling—to ensure every young person has access to guidance, empowerment, and the chance to build a future without limits.
 
Since 2010, Leah has dedicated herself to mentoring young people, helping them see beyond obstacles and dream beyond limitations. And, in 2022, she founded P.U.U.S.H. (Pushing Underprivileged, Underestimated Students Higher), offering faith-inspired awareness and development programs to enhance academic excitement, life-skill training, and leadership opportunities for students who might otherwise be left behind.
 
Through P.U.U.S.H., Leah is giving young people in our community a seat at the table and the skills and confidence to take the lead. By supporting and empowering young people, Leah is continuing the legacy of Dr. King and making a real difference in the lives of countless students and, in turn, strengthening our entire community.

'1882846852816539655',"Each week, we shine a spotlight on individuals and organizations whose extraordinary contributions make a profound difference in the lives of others. This week, we celebrate a remarkable woman who has devoted her life to embracing differences, championing individuality, and harnessing the transformative healing power of horses to change lives. Meet this week's Hometown Hero—Janice Witt, Executive Director of the Warrington-based non-profit @SpecialEquest.
 
Janice’s journey is one of purpose and perseverance—a testament to turning passion into progress and vision into reality. Her work is not just remarkable; it is life-changing. Since stepping into her role as Executive Director in 2022, Janice has not only steered Special Equestrians through challenging times but has redefined what is possible. With over a decade of experience in nonprofit therapeutic horseback riding and a lifelong connection to horses, Janice has taken the reins with courage and conviction, transforming lives one stride at a time.
 
With a bachelor’s in psychology from Ursinus College and master’s in occupational therapy from Temple University, Janice began her career in early intervention and school-based therapy. Yet her heart always led her back to horses, drawn to their unique ability to heal, teach, and empower. This passion, combined with her expertise, has elevated Special Equestrians into a beacon of hope and transformation for our community.

Under her leadership, Special Equestrians has become a sanctuary for people of all ages and abilities—a place where differences are not just accepted but celebrated, where challenges are met with compassion, and where potential is nurtured with every step.
 
When the pandemic forced the organization to close its doors, Special Equestrians faced an uncertain future. But Janice’s resilience turned adversity into opportunity. Through her steadfast leadership and unwavering commitment, the program not only reopened but emerged stronger than ever. Today, it serves over 100 riders weekly and touches hundreds more through innovative outreach programs that bring the healing power of horses to schools, nursing homes, and community centers.
 
Janice is also working to create innovative mental health programming. Her visionary Therapeutic Horsemanship program, tailored for individuals confronting mental health challenges such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression, goes far beyond traditional therapy. It fosters resilience, equips participants with critical coping skills, and strengthens emotional well-being through the quiet yet profound connection between humans and horses.

The true impact of Janice’s work is measured in the lives she has touched: the child with autism who discovers newfound confidence in the saddle, the veteran with PTSD who finds solace in the steady rhythm of a horse’s steps, and the senior who rediscovers joy through the gentle nuzzle of a horse. These are the moments that define Janice’s legacy.
 
For hundreds of individuals who walk through its doors, Special Equestrian's therapy offers life-changing transformation. Her influence extends beyond the riders, touching families, caregivers, and entire communities.

Moving forward, Janice is working to expand resources, eliminate waitlists, and break down barriers to ensure Special Equestrian's life-changing programs are available to everyone in need. In her words: “I want to say yes to everyone who wants to experience the healing power of horses.”
 
Please join me in applauding Janice and her entire team of staff, volunteers, and incredible horses for their unwavering dedication to improving the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of others.

This important bipartisan legislation, which I’ve proudly co-sponsored over the past three Congresses, will provide Medicare beneficiaries with greater access to a wider range of pain management options. It’s long past time to eliminate the outdated restrictions that prevent chiropractors from providing the full scope of care our seniors need to live healthier, more comfortable lives.

Today, we celebrate a man whose unwavering dedication, courageous leadership, and boundless compassion have shaped the very fabric of our community. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: Lower Makefield Police Chief Ken Coluzzi.
 
From the moment he fulfilled his dream of becoming a police officer in 1978, Ken Coluzzi dedicated himself to protecting and serving others. Over the next 48 years, his career became a masterclass in law enforcement, marked by integrity, determination, and an unrelenting pursuit of justice. Rising through the ranks of the Philadelphia Police Department, he commanded elite investigative units and tackled some of the city’s most challenging and high-profile cases. His work—on cases such as the “Boy in the Box” cold case, the Center City Rapist, and the Pier 34 collapse—not only brought closure to families but also demonstrated his steadfast commitment to truth and fairness.

Then, in 2000, we welcomed Ken to our Lower Makefield Community to serve as police chief. Throughout his 24 years of service in our community, Chief Coluzzi worked tirelessly to transform the department, expanding its ranks, professionalizing its operations, and fostering a culture rooted in fairness and trust. Under his leadership, the department achieved Pennsylvania State Accreditation and set a gold standard for excellence. His advocacy to equip our local first responders with Narcan has helped to save 42 lives in Lower Makefield alone and has become a model for departments across Bucks County.

Chief Coluzzi’s impact has extended far beyond his badge; he has served as a source of strength and compassion during times of tragedy and triumph alike. From supporting families affected by 9/11 to advocating for vulnerable members of our community and fostering strong police-community relations, his leadership was defined not just by his ability to protect but his commitment to building trust, unity, and a sense of belonging.
 
As Chief Coluzzi steps into a well-deserved retirement, he leaves behind a legacy that is both profound and enduring. His dedication has touched every corner of Lower Makefield, and made our community not only safer, but truly better.

'1877774264192925772',"Each week, we celebrate the stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district—remarkable individuals whose actions ripple outward and go beyond the ordinary. Today, we shine a light on a man who has dedicated his life to our safety, our justice, and our community. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: Pat McGinty of Middletown Township.

For nearly four decades, Pat McGinty stood as a protector and cornerstone of our community. From the moment he first pinned on the badge in 1974, Pat embraced a calling that was not just a job, but a profound commitment to serve. As a patrolman, K-9 detective, lieutenant, sergeant, and acting public safety director, he didn’t just uphold the law—he wove himself into the very fabric of Middletown Township, becoming a beacon of safety, justice, and compassion.

Pat’s dedication went far beyond the routine duties of a police officer. He carried the weight of some of our community’s darkest moments, always rising to meet the call with integrity and resolve. Whether it was reopening cold cases to bring long-overdue justice to grieving families, ensuring that no rookie officer bore the emotional burden of a death notification alone, or leading the investigation of the tragic loss of Newtown Police Officer Brian Gregg in 2005, Pat approached every challenge with a steady hand and a compassionate heart. He understood that behind every case, every tragedy, there were human lives—families yearning for closure, communities yearning for healing.

A graduate of the FBI's National Academy, a prestigious training course in Quantico, Va., for law enforcement leaders across the globe, he earned the respect of law enforcement leaders across the country, while never losing sight of the community he served at home. He was a mentor to fellow officers, a guide to those starting their careers, and a symbol of excellence in law enforcement. Pat elevated those around him, creating a legacy of leadership that continues to shape the next generation of our officers.

But perhaps what speaks most to Pat’s character is his humility. He never sought recognition or accolades. For Pat, service was its own reward. Even after his retirement in 2011, he continued to give back, working in juvenile fingerprinting and DNA analysis at the Doylestown Courthouse.

This past Saturday, as a parade of officers and firefighters from across our region came together to honor Pat, it was clear just how deeply he is woven into the heart of this community. Recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of terminal cancer, Pat reminded us of the profound truth of his life’s work: “The impact of this work reaches far beyond the badge.”

Pat McGinty hasn’t just serve our community—he has shaped it. He has stood with us in times of joy and sorrow, in moments of triumph and tragedy. He has been more than a law enforcement officer; he has been a guardian of our safety, a champion of justice, and a steadfast presence in our lives. His legacy is not written in medals or titles, but in the countless lives he has touched, the peace he has preserved, and the community he has helped protect.

To Pat’s beloved wife Nancy, his children, and his grandchildren: your sacrifices and unwavering support have been a cornerstone of Pat’s service. You have shared him with all of us, and for that, we are forever grateful.

Pat, you are more than a hero—you are a symbol of what it means to give everything for the good of others. On behalf of an immensely grateful community, thank you for your service, your sacrifice, and your steadfast dedication to making our world a better, safer place. May God bless you and your family, and know that your lifetime of service will continue to inspire our community forever.",en,Tweet,0,4,0,1,841,2025-01-10 17:47:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg8xvPIXsAAiPGS.jpg

'1875226110306267188',"Each week, we celebrate the stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district, individuals whose actions transform lives and leave a lasting mark on our community. Today, we honor an extraordinary woman whose unwavering compassion and commitment are a testament to the power of one person’s determination to change the world—meet this week’s Hometown Hero, Fran Held, of Lansdale.

From an early age, Fran was drawn to helping others—working tirelessly to address homelessness, poverty, and food insecurity wherever she could. For years, she served without fanfare or recognition, simply answering the call of those in need. But one day, Fran received a phone call that changed everything.

The voice on the other end said, “I heard you’re the lady who will help me when no one else will.” In that moment, Fran realized her calling was not just a passion but a mission. She understood then that although she didn’t have vast financial resources, she had something even more powerful—a heart willing to act.

In 2009, Fran turned compassion into action by founding Mitzvah Circle, a nonprofit dedicated to restoring dignity and hope for families facing extraordinary hardships.

Today, Mitzvah Circle serves over 73,000 families annually, distributing 4.5 million essential items—including 3 million diapers—to address urgent needs. With 1 in 3 American families unable to afford diapers, the organization provides critical supplies like wipes and baby essentials to protect children’s health and help parents return to work.

But Mitzvah Circle goes further, offering over 100 necessities—clothing, school supplies, toiletries—providing essential support and empowering families to regain stability and build brighter futures.

In addition, their Teen Ambassador Program provides an invaluable opportunity for high school students to make a meaningful impact while cultivating essential leadership skills that will serve them, our community, and country for a lifetime.

Mitzvah Circle’s impact is a community effort, with partnerships spanning nearly 300 organizations and the dedication of more than 4,200 volunteers each year. From churches and synagogues to mosques and civic groups, Fran has worked to build bridges that unite people across faiths and backgrounds in the common mission of kindness and care. In Fran’s words, “You don’t have to change your entire life to make an impact. One act of kindness can change everything for someone.”

Fran’s unwavering dedication has built a brighter future for thousands. She has shown us that compassion is the cornerstone of a strong community, and her leadership continues to inspire us to build a better world—one act of kindness at a time.

Today, we honor an extraordinary collaboration that showcases the boundless strength of compassion and the transformative power of community. This week’s Hometown Heroes are the Northampton, Neshaminy, Middletown, and Bristol Senior Centers, along with the Bucks County Sheriff's Community Outreach Unit.
 
Together, this remarkable group of Seniors and law enforcement officers united to confront an urgent and often overlooked crisis: providing critical support to our homeless community during the coldest months of the year. For those without shelter, these unforgiving temperatures are not merely uncomfortable; they are life-threatening. A warm coat, sturdy shoes, or even a simple blanket can mean the difference between life and death.
 
Recognizing this dire need, they joined forces through the Sheriff's Help for the Holidays initiative, collecting and donating hundreds of winter necessities—coats, gloves, scarves, blankets, shoes, and more. Last Friday, CPL Todd Kessler and Deputy Dion Thomas joined Venus Johnson of the Reach Out Foundation, Rodney Wyatt of Salute 2 Service, members of the Bucks County Park Rangers, and Matt Allen, Director of Veterans Affairs, to deliver these vital resources directly to those in need.

Today, we shine a spotlight on a remarkable young lady whose vision and compassion demonstrate what it means to lead with purpose—meet this week’s Hometown Hero, Grace Arner of Holland.
 
Grace, a talented cellist, has undertaken an extraordinary mission to ensure every child, regardless of financial circumstances, can experience the transformative power of music. She understands music is more than notes; it’s a sanctuary, a form of self-expression, and a source of healing. For children facing stress, anxiety, or hardship, music can be a lifeline—a way to process emotions, find joy, and build confidence. Yet, she also knows the cost of instruments can make this dream unattainable for many families.
 
Driven by her determination to make a difference, as part of her Eagle Scout project, Grace has set out to collect and restore instruments to their former glory, opening the door for children in our community to unleash their creativity, experience the transformative joy of music, and build a foundation for a brighter future. In addition, she has partnered with the @CouncilRockSD Music Foundation, a remarkable organization dedicated to providing scholarships for aspiring musicians and ensuring instruments reach those in need. Through this partnership, Grace has committed any unused funds from her efforts to be donated to the foundation, amplifying her impact by creating even more opportunities for students to pursue their musical dreams and carry forward the rich tradition of music education within our community.
 
Her project will culminate with a benefit recital and final donation drive at Holland Middle School on January 31st, where she has invited the community to come together to be a part of her special initiative. Along with her fellow Scouts, Grace will share her talents in a recital that embodies the very spirit of her mission: turning passion into purpose and dreams into reality.

Today, we shine a spotlight on a truly extraordinary couple who have demonstrated resilience, strength, and unwavering hope in the face of unimaginable adversity—meet this week's Hometown Heroes, Tony and Katie Ferrandino of Newtown.
 
For the Ferrandinos, life once seemed picture-perfect. Their son, Drew, was a vibrant child who filled their days with laughter and love. But on Drew’s third birthday, their world was forever changed when Drew experienced his first seizure. Over the next two years, they traveled across the country, sought out specialists, and refused to rest until they understood what was happening. At the age of five, Drew was diagnosed with Batten Disease (CLN2), a rare and devastating degenerative neurological condition—a disease for which there is no cure and is always fatal. For children like Drew, life expectancy is heartbreakingly short, with the disease robbing them of their ability to walk, talk, and even feed themselves. Yet, through it all, Drew’s spirit remained a beacon of light for his family.
 
Tragically, Drew passed away at just 12 years old on September 30, 2014. In the wake of such an indescribable loss, many would understandably be consumed by grief, but Drew and Katie Ferrandino chose a different path. Instead, they founded Drew’s Hope Research Foundation, dedicating their lives to funding research, advocating for new treatments, supporting other families, and spreading awareness about Batten Disease. What began as an act of love for their son has become a lifeline for countless families facing similar battles. Through Drew’s Hope, the Ferrandinos have supported over a dozen groundbreaking projects, including advancements in newborn screening, enzyme replacement therapies, and pioneering gene therapy. Each effort represents a step closer to a cure and a chance for children to have the futures they deserve.
 
The Ferrandinos exemplify what it means to rise above unimaginable hardship and channel grief into a force for good. Their work has not only propelled critical research but offered hope and support to countless families, ensuring no one faces this journey alone.
 
Tony and Katie, your courage, determination, and compassion embody the very essence of what it means to be a Hometown Hero.

'1865118369680134575',"Each week, we celebrate the remarkable stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district, individuals who go above and beyond the ordinary. Today, we shine a spotlight on a man whose life has been defined by an unwavering commitment to service—meet this week's Hometown Hero, Merle Winslow of Bristol Borough. 
 
A lifelong Bristol Borough resident, Merle’s legacy of service began in 1964 when he joined the Bristol Consolidated Fire Company upon graduating from Bristol High School. He then answered the call to serve his country, enlisting in the United States Army in 1965. Stationed in Germany as a Morse Code Radio Operator, his leadership and discipline quickly set him apart, earning him a promotion to Sergeant E5 in under two years—a testament to his character and resolve.
 
Upon returning home, Merle continued to answer the call to serve, this time as the Bristol Borough Fire Inspector. By 1969, he was appointed Fire Marshal, working tirelessly for nearly a decade to protect Bristol families and businesses. In 1995, Merle took on the role of Deputy Emergency Management Coordinator, and then, in 2003, stepped into the position of Emergency Management Coordinator—where he has served with unwavering commitment for the past 21 years. Throughout countless emergencies, Merle has been a steady, reliable leader, consistently guiding the community through crises with courage and expertise. His leadership has saved countless lives, prevented disasters, and ensured the safety of historic Bristol Borough.
 
Perhaps most inspiring is Merle’s enduring role as a volunteer firefighter. For an incredible 60 years, he has answered the call, running toward danger to protect others—a selfless commitment made even more remarkable when you consider he accomplished this alongside his demanding role as Emergency Management Coordinator.
 
Merle's lifetime of service and leadership have shaped a safer, stronger community, setting a standard for public service, and his kindness and spirit of generosity have earned him a place in the hearts of all who know him and the Bristol Borough history books. 
 
Please join me in thanking Merle for his decades of extraordinary service and wishing him a well-deserved retirement filled with happiness, joy, and the knowledge that his contributions have made an indelible impact on our community.",en,Tweet,0,5,0,1,802,2024-12-06 19:37:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeI7REDWsAAAlNP.jpg

Today, we shine a spotlight on a Bucks County native working to change lives—meet Taylor Kreiling, founder of Dream Drive.
 
While Taylor has a successful career in Healthcare IT, her true calling lies in advocating for the well-being of children and families in need. Recognizing the pressing need to support underprivileged families year-round, especially children in foster care, Taylor founded Dream Drive in 2012. What began as a small effort with 25 volunteers has grown into a robust, community-wide network that has touched the lives of hundreds of children and families across Bucks County.
 
For the past nine years, Dream Drive has ensured that over 300 children experience the joy of Christmas—providing gifts, festive celebrations, and the invaluable opportunity to create lasting memories filled with love and care. Furthermore, Taylor's mission extends beyond the holiday season; it is a year-round commitment of support. Dream Drive provides vital hygiene kits, backpacks filled with school supplies, pantry essentials, birthday celebrations, and seasonal care packages. But perhaps the most important part of her work is the unwavering support she provides to teens aging out of the foster care system—a vulnerable group often left to navigate adulthood without guidance or resources. Dream Drive provides tools and support to transition into independence and a brighter future. Taylor is also a fierce advocate for mental health awareness within the foster care system, partnering with organizations to bring about meaningful change.
 
Please join me in applauding Taylor Kreiling for her extraordinary dedication and selfless service to our community. She has sparked a transformative movement of inspiring hope, lifting spirits, changing lives, and creating a ripple of generosity throughout our community.

'1860022805737206088',"Each week, we share the remarkable stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district, individuals who rise above and inspire us all. Today, we pause to honor the life of an extraordinary man—Frank Mongiello of Yardley, an ALS Warrior whom we sadly lost this week, and whose courage, advocacy, and unwavering determination changed lives and inspired a movement of hope.
 
In 2015, Frank's life was forever changed by his ALS diagnosis—a moment that could have silenced hope for many. Though this devastating disease slowly claimed his ability to walk, talk, swallow, and even breathe, it never touched his indomitable spirit. Instead, he turned his battle into a powerful mission. Refusing to let ALS define him, Frank became a tireless voice for the voiceless and a symbol of resilience and hope for millions of families nationwide.
 
Frank was a driving force behind my Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, & Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act. Our historic law created a new pathway for terminally ill patients caught between the traditional drug approval delays, clinical trials for which they do not qualify, and limited time to access experimental treatments, providing families the opportunity to pursue potentially life-saving treatments for their loved ones. It was one of the greatest honors of my life to work alongside Frank as we fought to turn this vision into a reality. His relentless determination and advocacy were instrumental in shaping this law—from its conception to its passage.
 
Frank was more than an advocate; he was a devoted husband, a proud father of six, and a steadfast friend. Alongside his wife, Marilyn, he used his platform to amplify the voices of others, showing the world the power of courage, compassion, and action. 
 
Frank's story is one of extraordinary strength and selflessness. His unwavering resolve reminds us of the importance of standing up for those who cannot stand for themselves. He showed us that even in the face of unimaginable adversity, hope can ignite change, and determination can move mountains.
 
Please join me in offering condolences to Marilyn, their children, and all who knew and loved Frank—a true Hometown Hero. While he will be deeply missed, his indomitable spirit will live on and continue to guide us as we fight for a cure in his honor.",en,Tweet,1,5,0,3,1095,2024-11-22 18:09:29,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdAg4Z1WQAAZmbO.jpg

'1857469796557689078',"Each week, we celebrate the remarkable stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district, individuals who rise above the ordinary and inspire us all. Today, we shine a spotlight on a man whose extraordinary service to our nation and tireless advocacy for veterans continue to inspire and uplift our community—meet this week's Hometown Hero, David A. Christian. 
 
A Levittown native and Woodrow Wilson graduate, David is known throughout the country as the youngest, most decorated Vietnam War officer. David rose to the rank of Captain by 20, serving as an Airborne Ranger and Green Beret, whose bravery was legendary—leading missions deep into enemy territory, dismantling machine-gun nests armed with only hand grenades and a bayonet, and discovering enemy bases. His heroism earned him nominations for every valor award, including the Medal of Honor and seven Purple Hearts. 
 
David’s sacrifices were not without cost. Wounded in action seven times and severely burned by napalm, he returned to Bucks County with a new mission: to fight for his fellow veterans. Drawing from his pain and experience, he authored the nation’s first laws addressing Agent Orange exposure and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), setting a standard for veteran care that remains the “law of the land.”

His leadership and expertise earned him appointments under four U.S. Presidents and a role as Senior Advisor to the U.S. Senate on Foreign Relations. David also played a pivotal role in creating the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., raising $9 million to honor his fallen brothers.
 
To this day, David continues to serve our community and veterans, even establishing Victor Six, a non-profit focused on improving our local veterans' mental and physical well-being. The program provides free health and fitness training, fostering resilience, camaraderie, and hope while addressing the critical issue of suicide prevention within the veteran community. For his remarkable service, last May, David was inducted into the National Military Officers Hall of Fame. 
 
As we continue to reflect on Veterans Day, David’s story reminds us of the extraordinary courage, sacrifice, and service of our nation’s veterans. Honoring these heroes is not reserved for a single day, it is a responsibility we must uphold every day.
 
Dave, my friend, your sacrifices, leadership, and unyielding devotion to your fellow veterans inspire us all. You are not just a Hometown Hero—you are a national treasure.

'1854932793844973750',"Each week, we share the remarkable stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district—individuals who rise above the ordinary and inspire us all. Today, we honor the life and legacy of an extraordinary woman who touched countless lives in our community, a true Hometown Hero—Tina Marie Grady of Morrisville, whom we sadly lost a few weeks ago.

Tina’s life was a powerful testament to resilience, boundless compassion, and the extraordinary impact one person can have on the lives of others. Her 33 years of sobriety fueled her mission to become a beacon of hope and help for those struggling in our community. She was often the first to speak up and advocate for those facing addiction and mental health challenges, offering them unwavering support and reminding them that brighter days were possible. Tina provided invaluable hope and inspiration to so many, showing them they were never alone on their journey.

Her compassion for others shone most brightly through her passion for Christmas, a holiday she infused with purpose. She founded Evan’s Army Children Without  Parents, an organization named in honor of her late son, Evan, with the vision to bring the magic of Christmas to children who had lost a parent to addiction or suicide, ensuring they had the opportunity to experience the joy of Christmas morning—and she did just that. Just last year alone, Tina’s efforts brought Christmas joy to nearly 500 children, making sure that each of them felt loved and remembered.

Tina’s commitment did not stop with the holiday season. She worked year-round to ensure these children felt supported and valued, raising funds, gathering resources, and rallying the community to help them thrive. Under her leadership, Children Without Parents ~ Evan’s Army grew to become one of the largest toy drives and nonprofits in our area—a powerful testament to her tireless dedication and unbreakable spirit.

As co-chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Task Force, I had the profound honor of working alongside Tina and witnessing firsthand the incredible impact of her life’s work. Her passion for helping families and children affected by mental health and substance use crises went beyond dedication—it was a calling. Her warmth, compassion, and drive to make a difference inspired everyone who crossed her path, including me. 

Today, let us honor Tina’s memory by carrying her mission forward, remembering the love she brought to our community and the lives she changed for the better. Please join me in extending our condolences to Tina’s parents, Sam and Alison; her husband, William; her five children; her seven grandchildren; and all who loved her—she will never be forgotten, and her impact will be felt forever.",en,Tweet,0,7,1,2,932,2024-11-08 17:03:35,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gb4Lit4XMAEYAue.jpg

'1849845418013729017',"Each week, we share the remarkable stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district. Today, we shine a spotlight on an extraordinary young girl whose strength and compassion exemplify what it truly means to be a hero. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero—ten-year-old Francesca ""Frankie"" Wilson of Chalfont.
 
At just five years old, after her father Dan was diagnosed with lung cancer, Frankie went to school, grabbed the microphone at lunch, and rallied her peers to join her in prayer. But that was only the beginning of her journey as an advocate. Frankie became a driving force behind Links for Lungs, the nonprofit her family launched to raise funds for lung cancer research. Year after year, Frankie has been front and center, hosting lemonade stands and working at the family’s golf outings to ensure no family facing lung cancer feels alone. With every action she has taken, she shows that even the youngest among us can be powerful agents of change.
 
Then, in a heartbreaking twist, this February, Frankie faced a battle of her own—her own cancer diagnosis. But where others might falter, Frankie drew from her strength and faith, meeting the challenge with the same resolve she has shown for years. 
 
Even as she endures months of chemotherapy, radiation, and the possibility of surgery, Frankie’s advocacy hasn’t slowed. She speaks openly about her diagnosis with friends, offering them a space to ask questions. In the hospital, she encourages other children—comforting them with kind words about feeding tubes, hair loss, and nutrition. Her mother, Brittany, put it best: “She embraces everything with her spunky spirit.”
 
Frankie Wilson teaches us a profound lesson: no matter the size of the struggle, we always have the choice to meet it with courage, love, and grace. Her resilience shows us that even in life's most difficult moments, we can still choose hope, find purpose, and make an impact on the world around us.
 
Please join me in celebrating and praying for this extraordinary young lady and the entire Wilson family. Frankie, your courage and spirit inspire us all.

By the 1950s, the Bracken Cadets were more than just a drum corps—they were ambassadors of Bucks County, proudly representing us in parades and festivals across the Philadelphia region.

For 100 years, the Corps gave us more than performances—they gave us tradition, unity, and pride. A very special thanks to Art Younglove for his efforts in organizing this wonderful tribute. 

Please join me in applauding the generations of Bracken Cadets who gave their time, talents, and hearts to our community—their legacy will march on forever.",en,Tweet,1,7,0,7,1007,2024-10-20 21:27:25,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaXD_R_W8AEzmnY.jpg

'1847315469717606477',"Each week, we celebrate the remarkable stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district—individuals who rise above the ordinary and inspire us all. Today, we shine a spotlight on an extraordinary man who has spent his life demonstrating the values of character, service, and generosity. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero—93-year-old U.S. Army veteran Robert Heath of New Hope.
 
Bob answered the call to serve during the Korean War, but his commitment to service only deepened once he returned home. For nearly 40 years, “Pop-Pop Heath,"" as the community knows him, has been a steadfast presence at New Hope-Solebury School District sporting events. With his camera in hand, he captures priceless moments on the field, transforming them into keepsake DVDs that young athletes can cherish long after the last whistle blows. As Bob says, “It’s old school,” but there is something invaluable about giving someone a tangible piece of their journey to carry with them forever.
 
But Bob’s influence goes far beyond the camera lens. He has been a mentor, a role model, and an unwavering cheerleader—not just for his children, grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren, but for every student who takes the field. Bob has become “Pop-Pop” to generations of athletes, offering more than just encouragement—he provides a steady presence that builds confidence, instills values, and fosters a sense of family and belonging. 
 
In yet another remarkable act of service, Bob established a scholarship fund to reward New Hope-Solebury athletes who demonstrate character, sportsmanship, and integrity and inspire future generations to live by these same principles. In a particularly fitting tribute, the New Hope-Solubury Athletic Hall of Fame was dedicated and renamed the New Hope-Solebury Robert. D Heath ""Pop-Pop Heath"" Athletic Hall of Fame in his honor, ensuring his legacy of kindness, dedication, and community spirit will continue to inspire our community for years to come. 
 
Bob is the embodiment of living a life with purpose, kindness, and compassion. His ""old-school"" gesture is an act of profound generosity and offers something deeper: a meaningful gift of memories and the invaluable connection of family. Through decades of dedication, he has quietly built a legacy of community spirit, reminding us that small gestures, given with heart, create lasting bonds.

This is not just a tale of athletic triumph, although their accomplishments on the water are nothing short of extraordinary. Led by the incredible Chris and Jaquelyn Wetzel, the Bucks County Dragon Boat Association (BCDBA) recently competed on the world stage in Ravenna, Italy, against the top dragon boat teams from around the globe. They brought home two silver medals and a gold—an achievement that speaks volumes about their talent, determination, and dedication. But as impressive as these victories are, their most profound accomplishment wasn’t measured in medals but in saving a life.
 
On September 3rd, following a grueling 2000-meter race that earned them the silver medal, Christy Murphy and her Women's Senior A teammates were paddling back to the docks when they saw a man in the water, struggling to stay afloat. It was a moment that could have paralyzed many with fear, but instead, it became a moment of pure heroism. Without a second thought, Christy sprang into action, drawing on the same strength, precision, and teamwork that had carried them through the race. She knew every second was crucial.
 
With her teammates rallying behind her, Christy plunged into the water and swam to the struggling man. With the help of her teammates, they pulled him onto their boat and safely transferred him to the motor rescue they had flagged down. On that day, this remarkable group of Bucks County women did not just prove themselves as world-class athletes—they showed us all what it means to be true heroes. This extraordinary and selfless act transcends any medal or title, reminding us of the power of human connection, teamwork, and what we are capable of when we come together.

'1843280593834094628',"One year ago today, the world witnessed a day of unimaginable horror. On October 7th, Hamas launched a brutal and unprovoked assault on innocent civilians in Israel, including Americans, marking the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. This grim anniversary serves as a solemn reminder of the families torn apart, communities devastated, and the deep wounds that still linger. Yet even in the face of such unspeakable tragedy, one truth remains steadfast: Israel will endure, and those who seek its destruction will never prevail.
 
In the two months following this heinous attack, antisemitic incidents in the U.S. surged by 358% compared to the previous year. A year later, this pattern of hatred and violence continues to rise across the world. We cannot—and will not—allow antisemitism to become normalized. We cannot let terror take root.
 
As Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism, it is my mission to ensure our friends in Israel and our Jewish communities here in America and around the world are not just supported but protected—unequivocally and without hesitation. I have, and will always, push forward and champion initiatives to confront the scourge of antisemitism at every level—from our campuses to the global stage—because this hatred, in all its forms, must be met with unwavering rejection and decisive action.
 
Today, as we remember the victims of October 7th, we renew our vow to be relentless in the fight against terrorism and antisemitism and to stand unwaveringly with our friends in Israel, always. Though hatred seeks to divide us, the resilience of the human spirit and the strength of our shared values will prevail.

'1842234557732454510',"Each week, we celebrate the remarkable stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district. Today, it is with immense pride that we shine a spotlight on an extraordinary group of women whose legacy has not only shaped our past but continues to inspire our future. Meet this week’s Hometown Heroes—the incredible women of PA-1 who answered our nation’s call as Rosie the Riveters during World War II.
 
When our country needed them most, these women—our mothers, grandmothers, sisters, and neighbors—rose to the occasion with unshakable courage and conviction. They rolled up their sleeves and got to work on factory floors, shipyards, and munitions plants, pouring their energy and spirit into the war effort. With every bolt tightened and every rivet placed, they laid the foundation for the America we know today, breaking down barriers, shattering stereotypes, and opening doors for future generations. The Rosies of PA-1 embodied the spirit of resilience, determination, and patriotism, showing the world that strength knows no bounds.
 
For far too long, their immense contributions went unrecognized, which is why I introduced the Rosie the Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act—signed into law in 2020—to ensure these trailblazers, who taught us all what We Can Do It truly means, received the long overdue honor they so richly deserve. 
 
This past weekend, I hosted a ceremony in our community to honor our remarkable Rosies. Surrounded by their families, we presented them with Congressional Gold Medals, citations, and American flags flown over the U.S. Capitol. It was a day filled with joy, reverence, and heartfelt remembrance. It was the honor of a lifetime to celebrate with our living Rosies, Rita Colella, Dorothy Trate, Michaeline Kryven, and Mae Krier, as well as with the families of the Rosies no longer with us: Pauline Biedka, Angela Calabrese, Virginia DiMaggio, Sarah Eglinger, Marion G. Gelb, Eunice Pearl Heath, Beverly Jean O’Bradovic, Angelina Romello, Barbara Roth, Alice K. Schafer, Mary Schaefer Simmons, Ann Meredith Smith, Eleanor Sladko Stern, Rose Sutor, and Doris Wiley McNichol. 
 
These PA-1 women didn’t just contribute to a war effort—they forged a path for generations of women to follow. Their efforts ensured the torch of liberty would continue to burn bright, and their example inspires us to meet the challenges of our own time with the same resolve, determination, and love of country. The indomitable Rosies of Bucks and Montgomery Counties continue to remind us that when we come together with a shared purpose, there is no challenge we cannot overcome.
 
Please join me in celebrating these extraordinary women, thanking them for their sacrifice, their trailblazing spirit, and their enduring impact. The Rosies of PA-1 define what it means to be true Hometown Heroes, and their legacies will be forever etched into the history of our community and great nation.",en,Tweet,0,1,0,4,676,2024-10-04 17:05:20,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZDukHtWQAAD3XL.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZDukHrXQAAjHwZ.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZDukHpWEAI8Kj_.jpg"

'1839700765658460237',"This week, our Hometown Hero spotlight shines on a man whose remarkable career embodies dedication, leadership, and an unyielding commitment to the safety and well-being of our community. As we celebrate his retirement, we honor his legacy of nearly four decades of service and leadership. Meet Chief Dean Logan, this week's Hometown Hero.

For 37 years, Chief Dean Logan has been a cornerstone of strength, compassion, and leadership, shaping the @DoylestownTwp Police Department and the very spirit of our community. From his first day on the job in 1987, Chief Logan embodied what it means to serve—always ready to roll up his sleeves, face challenges head-on, and rise to the occasion whenever Doylestown needed him. His rise from patrol officer to detective and ultimately to Chief reflects his remarkable talents, unparalleled character and integrity, and commitment to excellence.

Over the past twelve years as Chief, his visionary leadership has transformed the Doylestown Police Department. He not only grew the department in size; he elevated its stature. By embracing cutting-edge technology, strengthening community relations, and leading the charge to secure accreditation with the Pennsylvania Law Enforcement Accreditation Program—an honor held by fewer than 10% of departments statewide—Chief Logan set a new standard of excellence. His tireless efforts have made Doylestown a safer, brighter, more resilient community. 

What makes Chief Logan exceptional is not just his professional accomplishments—but his heart and ability to lead with kindness, strength, and respect, both within his department and throughout the community he proudly calls home. A Doylestown native and Central Bucks East graduate, Chief Logan returned home after attending Shippensburg University, driven by a deep desire to give back to the community that shaped him.

Barbara Lyons, the longtime Township Supervisor, said it best: ""Chief Logan did not just lead by example but built a department that reflects his values. The officers who serve under him do not just show up to hand out speeding tickets—they are a part of the fabric of this community. That is Chief's legacy.""

Please join me in honoring Chief Logan for a lifetime of extraordinary leadership and service—a true Hometown Hero who gave his all to make our community safer, stronger, and more united. While he will be missed, we celebrate this well-earned milestone and extend our heartfelt congratulations as he embarks on a well-deserved retirement. Chief Logan’s impact on Doylestown is immeasurable, and his legacy will inspire future generations of leaders.

'1839022146674172164',"Today, we celebrate the anniversary of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), a landmark law signed by President Johnson in 1966 that transformed the treatment of animals in research laboratories.
