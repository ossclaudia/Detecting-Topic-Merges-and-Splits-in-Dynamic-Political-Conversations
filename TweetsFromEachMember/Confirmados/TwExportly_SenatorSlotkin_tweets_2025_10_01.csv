When the dust and smoke cleared, I knew I wanted to pursue national security as a career. I ended up at the CIA, the Department of Defense, and now a Senator.

Today, we remember those we’ve lost and the courage of our first responders. This is my first 9/11 anniversary in the Senate. An alarm sounded at the moments the two planes hit, and someone came over the all-campus system to remind us of those harrowing moments.

But given how angry and tense Americans feel right now, the anniversary serves as a stark reminder of what those days and weeks were like just after the attacks. 

There were painful and trying moments, including for Muslim-Americans. But overall, all Americans were united. We were on the same team. We didn’t yet know what the post-9/11 world would be like, but we did in those first days feel a sense of common purpose — something that feels very far away right now.

So on this anniversary, in addition to remembering the victims and the first responders, please take a moment to think about those days afterwards and remember the care we felt for our fellow Americans that feels miles away right now.",en,Tweet,2,146,26,38,12515,2025-09-11 16:20:04,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1958914967861608641',"One of my favorite parts of being a Senator is working with interns in both my Washington D.C., and Michigan offices. From answering Michiganders’ calls and mail, to taking notes in meetings and hearings, to serving hot dogs on National Hot Dog Day, this inaugural class of Senate interns has done it all. 

One of the highlights was our version of Shark Tank, where interns research and pitch me on a bill they want me to cosponsor — a high-stakes tradition we first introduced back when I was in the House. They prep a memo, practice their briefings, and then pitch me in front of the team. I pepper them with questions, just as I do with my full-time staff — and I’ve co-sponsored a number of good bills coming out of it.

These future leaders — all of whom are Michiganders or attend school in Michigan — have bright futures ahead of them. Thanks for all your hard work this summer!

'1951056532193611924',"Last night I unfortunately missed a vote series on two Joint Resolutions of Disapproval regarding the sale of weapons to Israel.

I have struggled with this Joint Resolution of Disapproval more than any previous votes in the nearly two years since Hamas initiated the attacks of October 7. I represent a state with a large Arab and Muslim population and a large Jewish population. And over these last two years, few issues have been as raw as this one. I have therefore worked very hard to call balls and strikes based on my experience and the facts on the ground, even as most people fall firmly into one side or another, and are often reluctant to consider new information.

I owe it to my state to make clear where I stand: Had I made it back for the vote yesterday, I would have voted yes to block offensive weapons to Israel based on my concerns over lack of food and medicine getting to civilians in Gaza.

I have been a strong supporter of the Jewish State of Israel my whole life. And I still am. But despite the fact that Hamas began this bloody round of conflict—and refuses to release the hostages—the images of emaciated children are hard to turn away from. As are the calls from Michiganders who have friends and family trying to survive in Gaza.

This issue is now widely acknowledged across the political spectrum. Even President Trump this week has expressed concern over the humanitarian situation and urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to ensure the safe delivery of assistance to those in need.

In general, I think these Disapproval votes are a bad way to do foreign policy. The Executive Branch, whether run by Democrats or now Republicans, has the responsibility to set U.S. foreign policy, and to lead negotiations with both allies and adversaries.

But it appears today that the Netanyahu government thinks that there are no limits to what they can do while still receiving U.S. support. And so, I believe a message has to be sent. Should similar votes on offensive weapons come up in the future, I will take them on a case-by-case basis, with the hope of important humanitarian course corrections. I continue to support the U.S.-Israel security relationship and sale of defensive weapons such as the Iron Dome.

My views on this come from my experience of serving three tours in Iraq alongside the U.S. military. It was a very bloody war zone, including terrible violence on U.S. forces and Iraqi civilians, carried out by terrorist groups and militias. But even in the most violent years of the war, the U.S. still had the responsibility to facilitate humanitarian supplies into places like Fallujah. And militaries that can pull off dangerous and complex operations overseas can also ensure aid is safely distributed in occupied areas.

While the leaders of Hamas deserve what they’re getting in response to October 7, and Israel — like any other country in the world — has the right to defend itself, that doesn’t include letting children go hungry. That is despite Hamas’ sick refusal to relent, prevent further destruction, negotiate in good faith and release the hostages.

Lastly, I make this statement today because of my deep concern and conviction for Israel’s long-term security. I believe the Israeli people have the right to live a safe and secure life, free from threat, and chart their own destiny. The Israelis are right to demand the release of all the hostages, living and deceased, immediately and not in stages.

And it has to be said that Israel has dealt with threats to its existence every day since its founding, which is hard for the average American to comprehend. But the actions being taken now by the Netanyahu government threaten the longstanding bipartisan consensus that have helped keep Israel safe since its inception.

No one leader should so significantly threaten the long-term security of the state of Israel. I urge the Trump Administration and the Israeli Prime Minister to get aid in as soon as possible and save lives.",en,Tweet,265,1921,287,2162,1185905,2025-08-01 00:05:00,"<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web Client</a>",,,,

Israel has the responsibility to allow humanitarian aid in — just as the US had the responsibility to allow aid into places like Fallujah. And if President Trump’s hand-picked aid organization can’t get food and medicine to people in Gaza a safe way, Israel has the responsibility to find one that can.  

In the West Bank, Israeli settlers beat a Palestinian-American U.S. citizen to death. This totals 5 Americans killed in the West Bank since October 7, 2023 and more than a dozen Palestinians killed by lawless settler violence. It’s hard to understand this lack of accountability by the Netanyahu government as anything other than tacit approval by the state — something that should be treated as abhorrent by all decent people.   

This violence has to end. As I saw from my own experience in places like Iraq, democratic governments have responsibilities even when under threat.
