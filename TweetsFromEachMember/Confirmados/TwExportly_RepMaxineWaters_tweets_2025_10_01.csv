'1849615907854651577',"I suppose I should be shocked at the recent revelations that Gen. John Kelly has revealed about fascist Donald Trump. Donald Trump has been brazenly telling us about his love for Putin and Kim Jong Un. He has said that he wanted to be a dictator from day one. Kelly has further revealed that Trump said he wishes he had Hitler's generals, and that he overall admired Hitler. Trump has led his Republican Party into the undeniable loss of patriotism. All those who know and have witnessed Trump’s fascist remarks and actions should continue to come forward to help save our country from the real enemy from within… Trump!

Israel has a right to defend itself, however, unfortunately and sadly, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed. Israel and Hamas are at war and the entire Middle East is in danger of a regional war. There must be negotiations and every effort put forth for a ceasefire!",en,Tweet,4,212,45,155,33252,2024-10-08 02:22:10,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
