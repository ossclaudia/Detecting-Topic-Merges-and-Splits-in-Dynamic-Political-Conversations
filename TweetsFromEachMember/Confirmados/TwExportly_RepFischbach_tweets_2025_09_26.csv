@WaysandMeansGOP  has spent years listening to the American people about what is important to them, and the One Big Beautiful Bill delivers on those key issues. 

It secures our border, unleashes energy dominance, and cuts wasteful spending. Most importantly, it makes tax cuts permanent and avoids the biggest tax hike in this country's history, keeping money in the pockets of the American people. 

This Independence Day, @POTUS will sign into law a bill that reflects the core principles of liberty, personal freedoms, and progress that are central to America's foundation.
