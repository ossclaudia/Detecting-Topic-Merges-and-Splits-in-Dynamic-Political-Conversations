'1940842115959046195',"Congress has passed the long-discussed Big, Beautiful, Bill Act, and delivered the American people a huge victory. This legislation addresses many of the legislative priorities that President Trump promised to Americans during his campaign for President. Although the bill is not perfect, as none are, nor does it include several provisions of the original House version, I voted in favor of the largest tax cut in history, ending the Biden-era invasion of our southern border, and reducing wasteful and abusive spending of taxpayer dollars. 
 
Americans are tired of having a government that they are afraid of, and want a government they can be proud of. This Reconciliation package scales back the size and scope of federal agencies, cuts red-tape, brings more accountability, and cuts fraud, waste, and abuse. This bill is a good start, but Congress still has a lot of work to do; as we must continue to move back to a government that is small in size, limited in scope, and dedicated to preserving the rights and liberties of the American people.
 
Last November, voters gave the President and Congress an unprecedented mandate to govern, and to tackle the very challenges that this bill addresses. With this historic legislation, Americans will be keeping more of their hard-earned money and paying less for food and fuel, while enjoying a level of safety not seen in years, as our southern border becomes more secure. With President Trump’s signature, the Big, Beautiful, Bill will usher in the Golden Age of America and put our great country back on the path to prosperity.",en,Tweet,1,27,5,19,1205,2025-07-03 19:36:34,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
