'1937892472056844412',"This weekend’s stealth operation to strike three Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities was a testament to the professionalism and technological superiority of our armed forces. It also charts a pathway for a more secure Middle East long term.

The Trump administration’s decision to act now was time sensitive and for one fundamental purpose: preventing the Iranian regime from acquiring a nuclear weapon. I really want to emphasize the importance of timing here. Iran’s main nuclear facility at Natanz was enriching uranium past 60%, just a few short steps away from weapons-grade quality and far beyond the levels necessary to build a civilian nuclear energy program. For decades, the international community had tried to place limits on Iranian enrichment levels but failed repeatedly. Even the Trump administration made repeated efforts in weeks prior to bring Iran to the table, which were rebuffed.

The decision to destroy Natanz as well as the centrifuge cascades at Fordow and technology labs at Isfahan was the necessary one.

I’m also broadly supportive of the Commander in Chief having some discretion for making targeted strikes within the bounds of Congressional war powers. The 2001 Authorized Use of Military Force (AUMF) enables U.S. military operations against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks and those who harbored them. Iran fits this category well given that Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have frequently been given safe haven inside Iran.

Remember, these laws are what enabled President Obama to take out Osama bin Laden in 2011, President Trump to strike IRGC Commander Qassam Soleimani in 2020, President Biden to take out Ayman al-Zawahiri (Bin Laden’s successor) in 2022, and now President Trump again for this strike. Democrats and liberal commentators suggesting that President Trump didn’t have the authority to make this call are not being accurate or credible, especially if they were unwilling to say the same thing about previous Democrat administrations. There are also a small number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who don’t think any President should have any war powers and have consistently voted against AUMFs. I disagree with their assessment, but I respect their opinion only if they are consistent regardless of party affiliation.

If the President came to Congress with these strike plans in advance, I am certain they would be leaked before the meeting was over. I would love to see Congress debate and vote on a new AUMF that accounts for modern threats and cleans up old language, but given current law, the Commander in Chief can legally take action. There is a clear majority of lawmakers from both sides that agree the President has limited authority in these situations.

I’m glad that these highly targeted strikes were conducted with zero American casualties or excess collateral damage. It opens up a pathway for a Middle East that is free from an Iranian nuclear threat, one that is more securely in the hands of our allies and partners. Our resources are not unlimited, so my hope is that this enables the United States to focus more attention on the Indo-Pacific moving forward.",en,Tweet,0,14,0,10,1413,2025-06-25 16:15:44,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1935490460522263009',"The security environment in the Middle East is rapidly changing as we speak. I’m hesitant to offer definitive analysis in a time of such uncertainty, but here are a few core observations of mine from the past few days:
1) Israel’s clear-eyed decision to strike and dismantle a rogue Iranian nuclear program, one that was censured by UN authorities last week for breaching the Non-Proliferation Treaty, is firmly within the U.S. national interest. It’s a good thing that Iran’s ability to threaten the U.S., Israel, and our other allies with the nuclear weapon has now been degraded.

2) I’m glad that the White House has made clear that they are prioritizing the safety of our servicemembers in the region and the 500,000+ Americans living in Israel. They do not want to spark a wider regional war, and neither do I.

3) Conventional air superiority still reigns supreme. Drones/unmanned tech will continue to play a major role in the future of warfare but, as we saw, they cannot replace fifth generation aircraft. Utahns know this well with Hill Air Force Base being home to the nation’s first active duty F-35 wing. 

4) There is a quietly-growing consensus from our European and Arab partners that the best possible outcome is one where Iran can no longer possess a nuclear weapon. This consensus is long overdue.

5) Lastly, I realize this would be very difficult to achieve with the Ayotollah’s firm grip on power and the IRGC’s omnipresence, but I desperately hope this conflict leads to an opportunity for the amazing Iranian people to recapture a voice within their government and create more of their own destiny.",en,Tweet,1,18,2,32,21304,2025-06-19 01:11:00,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1846999828124815360',"The IDF’s elimination of Yahya Sinwar is a watershed moment in Israel’s campaign to defeat & dismantle Hamas. As the mastermind of the 10/7 attacks, Sinwar was responsible for the worst massacre against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. He also directly prolonged the suffering of innocent Palestinians by embedding Hamas into civilian areas, taking hostages, & stealing humanitarian aid. Those who claim to seek peace in the region will be glad he is gone. My hope is that this creates an opportunity for Israel to permanently remove Hamas from the Gaza Strip & work with regional partners on a governing arrangement that ensures Israel’s security. #utpol",en,Tweet,0,21,3,4,4008,2024-10-17 20:40:49,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
