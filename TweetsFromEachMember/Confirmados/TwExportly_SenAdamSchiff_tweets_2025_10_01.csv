This bill will result in the closure of hospitals and clinics, kick millions of Americans off their health care and slash food assistance, all in order to give a massive tax cut to wealthy people and corporations, while borrowing even more money from our kids to do it.  
  
No matter what Republicans say, let’s talk about what’s really in this bill:  
  
It will gut food assistance — a lifeline for seniors, working families, pregnant women, and children, who will go hungry.
  
It will slash Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, and lead to hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicare funding, kicking millions of Californians off of their health care when they can least afford it. 
 
It will shutter labor and delivery units and put hospitals at risk of closure around the country, especially in rural and underserved communities, leaving families with nowhere to seek care.   
  
It will decimate clean energy projects, cause hundreds of thousands of job losses, lead to higher energy bills every year, and put us behind China.  
  
It will skyrocket the national debt and deficit, leaving it for our children and grandchildren to pay — hypocrisy of the rankest order.  
  
Americans and Californians are hurting. Prices continue to go up. Housing continues to be unaffordable. And this bill will make things worse — much worse.   
  
What Californians need right now is a government that is working for them – not fighting against them.   
  
We should be focused on bringing down costs, expanding health care for millions, creating economic opportunities, and safeguarding Americans’ hard-earned ability to retire with dignity.

'1933374010403803451',"I am closely watching the situation in the Middle East after Israel launched an attack on Iran’s nuclear and missile programs, and against top officials, including military leaders. 

The Trump administration has said it did not participate in the attack and has moved to protect American forces in the region. Iran would be making a serious mistake to retaliate against U.S. forces or interests. 

Iran is a malicious actor and a state sponsor of terrorism that must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon. 

Since the first Trump administration withdrew from the previous nuclear agreement with Iran, it has continued to enrich uranium to higher and higher levels, reducing its breakout time substantially. 

Recently, the Trump administration has attempted to negotiate a new agreement to curtail Iran’s nuclear program that looks a lot like the old agreement.

That possibility is now less probable in the wake of this attack. 

The most immediate risk at the present is that of retaliation, miscalculation, and escalation, which could spiral into a regional conflict or all out war.

After the terrible trauma of the Hamas attacks of October 7th and the war in Gaza that has followed, the last thing the world needs is a wider war. 

My heart goes out to the people of Israel, now facing dangers from every direction. I support Israel’s right to defend itself against any imminent threat, including that emanating from Iran.

'1915415434934825118',"On today’s solemn anniversary, I join Armenians in California, all around the United States and around the world in remembering the 1.5 million men, women, and children who were systematically targeted in a campaign of mass murder, rape, and brutalization by the Ottoman Empire.

We must never forget the concerted efforts that saw Armenians from all walks of life rounded up, tortured, burned alive, and marched until death from exhaustion and starvation. Entire families wiped out as a result of what the U.S. Ambassador at the time called a 'campaign of race extermination.’ The first genocide of the 20th century.

Today’s anniversary also reminds us that the United States for too long stood in dishonorable silence on these events. While the Congress and the White House have finally taken that step to recognize the Armenian Genocide, there is more work to do in order to fully support our Armenian neighbors and friends. We must never retreat from that important progress.

I have sat down with survivors and have watched them relive the pain of this history over and over. We cannot pledge ‘never again’ if we do not also acknowledge that, even a century later, the wounds of this tragedy are still open. And in tragic ways, they begin anew.

Turkey continues to engage in a long and dangerous campaign to deny the genocide and silence anyone who speaks the truth. Azerbaijan has also echoed the genocidal language and actions of a century ago, and with the support of Turkey, attacked Artsakh in 2020 and blockaded it for nearly ten months starting in December 2022. In 2023, the Aliyev regime took full advantage of a people they had systematically starved and ethnically cleansed Artsakh’s indigenous Armenian population.

We must hold Azerbaijan and those who continue to threaten Armenia and its people accountable. Only after the genocide is universally acknowledged and the continued threats to the Armenian community are ended can we truly say they we have honored the memory of those who were lost one hundred and ten years ago and stood with those who still carry those memories today.

The United States must call for Azerbaijan’s release of Armenian hostages, advocate for the protected return of Armenians to Artsakh, and call attention to the destruction and desecration of Armenian religious and cultural sites by Azerbaijan in its effort to erase Armenian culture and history. The United States must also urge the immediate withdrawal of Azerbaijani forces from Armenian territory, release of prisoners of war, support Armenia’s sovereignty, maintain international monitoring on Armenia’s borders, and provide security assistance to Armenia.

Despite the trials the Armenian people have faced and continue to face, it has not broken their faith, determination, or their will to survive. Time and time again, the Armenian people have overcome enormous hardship and loss, and yet, still remain strong and unbowed.

From shoulder to shoulder in our community to the U.S. Senate, I will always stand with the Armenian community.",en,Tweet,13,727,133,175,33691,2025-04-24 15:40:01,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

The president’s proposed budget cuts would gut the Mars Sample Return program, one of our top planetary science priorities with strong bipartisan support, which will not only see hundreds of jobs lost at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but also kneecap years of critical scientific progress that is already happening.

This would dismantle our greatest advantage in space and destroy our top centers of innovation, not just at JPL but at NASA facilities across California and the country.

It’s a gift to China, and a slap in the face to those that have dedicated years to making the American space program the best in the world.

The administration must reverse course for the sake of American jobs, ingenuity and our future.

'1904901445285015725',"As a former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, a few things leap out at me in reading the full Signalgate text chain: 

First, the specificity with which they identify one of their targets.

They refer to him as “the top missile guy,” and also reveal that they know where he is located: “his girlfriend’s building.”

Hegseth outlines exactly what military platforms will be used to carry out the strikes and also makes clear this is “the first target,” which suggests there could be more targets.

This means anyone with access to this non-secure thread could tip off the Houthis to immediately change their activity to evade being targeted next. 

Details like this should have been classified, because the public revelation of them could reveal sources and methods.

Houthis will now try to determine how we would know the identity of the target and their whereabouts, and other adversaries will examine this closely to understand our methods.

If these details had leaked in real time — and thanks to Jeffrey Goldberg for delaying their revelation — we also would have lost the opportunity to strike the targets.

Second, the wide disparagement of our European allies is another reason this chat should not have been undertaken on a commercial app.  The response from Europe was immediate yesterday.

The disclosure has naturally inflamed our allies and further embittered them against the United States. Again, these are our allies.

Third, in the chain, Vance suggested postponing the operation, and Hegseth responds: “2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive.” 

This again highlights how irresponsible it was to use a commercial app to discuss a potentially imminent attack. Had Goldberg decided to publish the text chain when he first received it — or the operation been postponed and the chat revealed — the targets would have fled. 

Hegseth later assured the others on the chat: “But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC. | welcome other thoughts.”

Operational security (or OPSEC) refers to the process of ensuring that sensitive information like this text chat doesn’t fall into the wrong hands and compromise the mission.

Of course, this was not 100% OPSEC.

The chat was on a commercial platform that DoD knew at the time to be vulnerable.  Two participants were overseas — one of them apparently in Russia — using unknown devices to communicate.  And a journalist was receiving every word.

In the text chain, Hegseth invited additional thoughts. Here’s one:

'1843273108498616513',"One year ago, Hamas launched a horrific mass terrorist attack on Israel.

Nearly 1,200 were killed – most of them civilians. Families were torn apart as Hamas indiscriminately launched rockets at kibbutzim and dragged hostages into Gaza.

Hamas terrorists committed unspeakable crimes against women and children in what was the darkest, most deadly day in Israel’s history. Raping, torturing and murdering its victims. 
 
A year later, there are still hostages held in tunnels under Gaza, including seven Americans – Keith Siegel, Edan Alexander, Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Gadi Haggai, and Judith Weinstein Haggai.

The families of these hostages still don’t know whether their loved ones will ever come home, and every day without their release brings a fresh trauma.

Hamas’ use of Palestinians as human shields continues to put the lives of innocent civilians at risk and exacts a terrible toll. 
 
A year later – as we continue to grieve and grapple with the terror of that day – we must recommit ourselves to bringing every hostage home; to securing a close to this conflict that ensures the end of Hamas as a governing entity or military threat; that allows Israelis to return to their homes without being shelled by Hezbollah; and that provides for the long-term safety and security of Palestinians as well.
