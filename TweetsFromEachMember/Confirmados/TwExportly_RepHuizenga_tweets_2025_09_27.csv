'1940850782183792841',"Today, Congress delivered on the promises President Trump and House Republicans made to the American people to stop the largest tax increase in our nation’s history. 

The One Big Beautiful Bill will help Americans across all walks of life by making tax cuts permanent and increasing take home pay as much as $7,500 through provisions such as no tax on tips and no tax on overtime. 

Additionally, by increasing tax breaks for seniors, strengthening the child tax credit for families, making made-in-America car loan interest tax deductible, and addressing inflation with the largest mandatory spending reduction ever, the Big Beautiful Bill will make everyday life more affordable.

Importantly, this bill makes significant progress to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse from both SNAP and Medicaid by implementing work requirements for able-bodied individuals without dependents. These common sense reforms will preserve these important safety net programs for those who need it most — namely, low-income mothers, children, the elderly, and disabled Americans. 

The One Big Beautiful Bill will supercharge Michigan’s economy by boosting manufacturing, helping farmers, modernizing our military, and unleashing American energy. 

Lastly, the One Big Beautiful Bill provides critical resources to ensure our border remains secure by finishing the wall and ensuring we have the law enforcement manpower we need to keep our nation safe.

By passing a comprehensive market structure framework, responsible actors will now have greater certainty and consumers, greater protection from bad actors.

'1925559821517955530',"Today the House passed transformative legislation to deliver permanent tax relief for middle class families and small business job creators. 

H.R. 1 prevents the largest tax increase in history while reducing taxes for Americans making $30,000 - $80,000 by 15%. 

Additionally, this measure provides relief for seniors while delivering on President Trump’s promise of no tax on tips as well as no tax on overtime which will help Michiganders keep more of their hard earned money. This bill also makes auto loan interest on a new vehicle tax deductible, a provision that I championed to increase Michigan manufacturing and make buying a new car more affordable. 

H.R. 1  embraces pro-family and pro-parent policies by increasing the Child Tax Credit, enhancing the Adoption Tax Credit, expanding 529 savings accounts, and establishing savings accounts for newborns. 

Importantly, H.R. 1 moves to protect and preserve Medicaid for those who need it the most by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse of this vital program. 

This legislation reestablishes work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents. It stops illegal immigrants from accessing taxpayer funded assistance, cracks down on those enrolled in multiple state programs, and strives to reduce the more than $500 billion in improper payments.

Lastly, H.R. 1 makes critical investments in areas such as border security to ensure the progress made to restore border integrity is not only maintained but enhanced. 

Overall, this legislation includes more than $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, supercharges economic opportunity, and substantially increases take home pay for millions of Americans while setting up Michigan and our nation for a manufacturing renaissance!",en,Tweet,3,129,25,82,10110,2025-05-22 15:30:11,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

This legislation, which was supported by President Trump, would have kept the government funded and addressed the debt ceiling, while providing disaster relief to impacted communities and assistance to our farmers.
