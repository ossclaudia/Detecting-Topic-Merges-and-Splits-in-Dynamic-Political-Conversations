We do not need to agree with the beliefs of everyone around us, but we do need to have the courage to see clearly how our hard heartedness, callousness, or indifference towards the humanity of others around us is tearing the country apart. We cannot simply call for unity or demand that others fix themselves without first addressing the ways that we have not lived up to our own standards. There cannot be unity and grace in this country until we as individuals confront our own shortcomings. 

I voted for the resolution to honor Charlie’s life — but no legislation is going to bring him back or bring our country back together without each of us as individuals taking accountability for the ways that we have conformed to the brokenness of this world, for our fixation on the flaws rather than beauty of our brothers and sisters.

'1940844510977593543',"I just voted NO on a partisan reconciliation bill ⬇️

Most of us want honest debate, compromise, and bipartisanship – not party favors for special interests and political parties. But D.C. is way out of balance when only one party has control, and we all suffer for it.

Congress had a chance to level the playing field for everyday people and small businesses – by cutting red tape, building national health, and unleashing low-cost energy. Instead, the Majority made the terrain more uneven.

I repeatedly joined fellow @HouseBlueDogs to offer our help crafting a fiscally-responsible proposal that provides tax relief for middle class families in #WA03 – but unfortunately the Speaker showed no appetite for bipartisanship.

Under this bill, everyday families will come out in the negative, while Wall Street reaps the real benefits. The top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would receive an average handout of $118,630 a year – while the bottom 20 percent lose $560 a year.

Plus, it’s one of the largest explosions of our debt ever from a single bill. A $4 trillion debt increase might just seem like another number on paper to politicians in D.C. – but that amounts to $31,000 in spending for every U.S. household.

It’s unsustainable to pass that burden of debt on to our kids.

Not to mention, our soaring national debt will worsen inflation and interest rates – while the bill drives up costs on energy, food, and healthcare premiums.

This legislation also will strip healthcare away from 17 million Americans – which is more than twice the total population of our state.

That’s 31,000 people in #WA03 who stand to lose healthcare – and rural hospitals across Southwest Washington are expected to lose tens of millions of dollars, which could put these lifelines at risk of collapse.

This doesn’t only affect those on Medicaid – when rural hospitals suffer, the health of rural communities like mine suffers.

Our community health centers and our corrections officers also pay the price when we gut Medicaid. I’ve heard from them how cuts like these will make their work even more difficult fighting our fentanyl and mental health crises on the front lines.

I refuse to defend bureaucratic inefficiency – and we need to aggressively root out waste, fraud, and abuse in our federal programs.

It’s why I recently voted against a bill that would defund our federal auditing watchdog by 50 percent. But suffocating hardworking citizens, seniors, and people with disabilities with more convoluted forms to fill out isn’t how we do it.

This bill has become so big and bloated that my colleagues have lost the plot. It’s grown detached from the President’s original promises to balance the budget, not touch Medicaid, and close the carried interest loophole, a measure I’ve led.

It was pushed through with budget gimmicks that disrespect the intelligence of my community, despite bipartisan opposition – and it was designed to shirk responsibility, with many of these harmful provisions only going into effect after the midterm elections.

'1925523849812045940',"I just cast my vote against a costly and irresponsible budget reconciliation bill.

Washington, D.C. is way out of balance right now, with one party controlling all the levers of government. This massive bill reveals the consequences of single-party control: it doesn’t balance the federal budget, it doesn’t balance the competing priorities I hear from my community, and it avoids making tough decisions in favor of making reckless ones.

It’s a package of party favors for special interests and extremists calling the shots in the majority party right now.
 
Politicians love to champion fiscal responsibility and use our national debt as a talking point, but at the end of the day, this wasteful legislation will explode our deficit by $3.8 trillion to advance profound tax cuts for the top 0.1% of earners. 
 
It drives up costs for everyday Americans on energy, healthcare premiums, and out-of-pocket costs – all while gutting the consumer finance watchdog that helps them fight back when they’re ripped off.
 
It breaks the President’s promise not to touch Medicaid – imposing new, difficult-to-navigate red tape and threatening the healthcare of roughly 21,000 people across Southwest Washington.
 
It raids food programs that advance our national health, keep food on families’ tables, and support our farmers.
 
That’s the real cost of handing out tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans.
 
As some of my House Republican colleagues sounded the alarms about how this bill will balloon our deficit, I stood ready to work with the Majority on a fiscally responsible bill that would level the playing field and make government deliver more effectively. 

Instead, they moved forward on an expensive, partisan plan that failed to include provisions like my bill to close the carried interest loophole – a fiscally smart policy advocated for by President Trump.
 
Working families understand the bitter consequences of carrying debt, and our federal government needs to meet them in that reality. 

This bill doesn’t align with the values held by my neighbors and constituents – and it disrespects their hard work to make ends meet. 

I’ll keep seeking out bipartisan solutions, fighting to advance opportunity in the middle class, and taking an independent stand for what truly matters to my community.",en,Tweet,6,179,33,51,12738,2025-05-22 13:07:14,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1899585631933673685',"Today, I voted against a flawed Continuing Resolution, because we should work on a bipartisan basis to pass a bill that works for communities like mine.

My highest priority in Congress is to defend the interests of #WA03 – and the path of chaos and uncertainty today’s partisan CR presents is at best counterproductive and at worst empowers the most partisan members of Congress to have the most say in how our public dollars are spent.

This CR fails to fund much-needed community-led investments across SW WA to support public safety, veterans, students, farmers, and utility infrastructure.

It lowers funding levels for the U.S. Geological Survey and NOAA, as our communities face concerns about seismic monitoring in the region and layoffs of employees that provide vital weather data for maritime safety.

It would also cut U.S. Army Corps of Engineers construction funding by 44% – which could impact efforts to keep goods moving safely on our waterways and manage flood risk – while halting new projects.

This legislation cuts nearly $800M from VA facility construction, doesn't protect funding levels for veterans homelessness, mental health, and addiction programs, and provides no advance appropriations for the Toxic Exposures Fund to avoid lapses in support for heroes suffering from service-connected illnesses.

It also decreases funding for state, private, and Tribal forestry programs that support forest management and prevent wildfire, small business development projects, clean drinking water grants, state and local law enforcement programs, and the Community Connect Program, which has supported rural broadband expansion in Lewis County.

A $20.2 billion cut to IRS operations and tax enforcement would also make it more difficult to investigate complex forms of tax evasion by the wealthiest Americans – which delivers a significant return on investment.

The DoD has also never operated for an entire fiscal year under a CR, which raises concerns about impacts on our military readiness.

Congress too frequently relies on stopgap measures, rather than completing full-year bipartisan funding solutions. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I know how important it is to protect Congress’s power of the purse – and provide guidance to agencies on how to effectively spend taxpayer dollars.

Congress needs to do the hard work of passing regular appropriations bills, rather than ceding our Constitutional obligations by relying on a hastily constructed CR.

I came to Congress to vote on the merits of bills. As an independent voice for SW WA, I’ll continue to put hardworking families first out of fierce loyalty to our communities.

'1897084633139044755',"Across #WA03, folks are facing challenges. Fentanyl continues to hollow out communities, it's still too difficult to start a small business, run a family farm, or buy a home, and prices for everyday needs like groceries, childcare, and more remain too high.

During tonight’s Presidential address, I hope we will hear a unifying message focused on how we can work together to address these challenges.

I would like the President to share plans to prevent a looming catastrophic government shutdown, support Ukraine against Putin’s unprovoked invasion, and find common ground to keep our woods working, expand opportunities in the skilled trades, and reform permitting to bring down costs of energy and housing.

Neither executive actions nor resulting litigation are a substitute for durable, bipartisan legislative work by Congress.

The President should also provide clarity about how we can steward taxpayer dollars and cut burdensome red tape in a way that respects the institutional knowledge and hard work of federal employees working timber sales, preventing wildfire, dredging our rivers, stringing power lines, delivering rural mail, and keeping fishermen safe with vital weather information.

Partisan tensions are flaring in the media – but it doesn’t eliminate the need to solve the problems that matter to Southwest Washington and that most of us agree on.
