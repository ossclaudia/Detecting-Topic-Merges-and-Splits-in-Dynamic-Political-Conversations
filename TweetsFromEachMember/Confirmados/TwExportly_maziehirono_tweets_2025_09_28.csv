'1893411307153436848',"President Trump’s decision to fire General CQ Brown, Admiral Lisa Franchetti, General James Slife, and the senior uniformed attorneys of the Army, Navy, and Air Force is an incredibly reckless decision that dangerously politicizes our military and undermines our national security, military readiness, and the rule of law, ultimately making Americans less safe. 

These senior leaders have faithfully and apolitically served our country for decades, providing exactly what the Constitution expects of them - their best military advice to civilian leadership. There is no reasonable justification for these terminations. Instead, the dismissals reveal the President’s true intention - installing a group of “yes men” with fealty to him and not the Constitution or the American people. It’s also revealing that General Brown and Admiral Franchetti, both fired, are the only person of color and woman, respectively, serving on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

The firings of each of the Services’ senior uniformed legal advisors is particularly troubling and completely unprecedented. These nonpartisan attorneys serve continuously in both Republican and Democratic administrations, without fear or favor. Our military leaders rely on them to provide their best legal advice, regardless of party.  It’s clear these individuals were singled out to ensure their successors understood that only the President’s expansive and legally dubious interpretations of military law would be tolerated. Ultimately, these dismissals will have a chilling effect on the willingness of uniformed attorneys to speak truth to power, undermining the rule of law.

At a time of global uncertainty, we need steady, experienced leadership at the highest levels of our military.  While President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have claimed repeatedly they want the military to focus solely on “lethality,” firing senior leaders willing to push back and installing “yes men” in their place will have the opposite effect. My Republican colleagues say they care about the military and are willing to spend billions more to increase lethality, but shamefully put their heads in the sand as the President threatens the foundation of our military and our democracy with these unprecedented firings. Now is the time for all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to prove they really care about the military by pushing back against this brazenly political attack.

Preserving the integrity of our armed forces is not a partisan issue. Every Member of Congress took an oath to support the Constitution and that oath compels each of us to push back against the President’s dangerous attempt to politicize our military.",en,Tweet,6,322,114,86,9837,2025-02-22 21:23:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

- Expand remote and subsistence harbors eligibility.
- Create an avenue for remote, coastal areas to include comprehensive cultural, social, and ecosystem benefits in cost-benefit analyses for small hurricane and storm damage reduction projects.

The extension of the Individuals and Households Program (IHP), including Financial Assistance and Direct Temporary Housing Assistance was originally set to end on February 10, 2025, but will now be extended to February 10, 2026.

There are currently 1,194 households occupying FEMA-provided units, and with this extension, survivors housed in temporary FEMA units will be able to continue working on their permanent housing plan and start paying rent, depending on their financial ability.

Occupants who provide documentation of their post-disaster income that meets or is below HUD’s very low-income limit will qualify for fully reduced rent of $50 per month without having to appeal and submit documentation of pre- or post-disaster housing costs.

Occupants with household incomes above the HUD very low-income limit will only have to provide documentation of post-disaster housing costs for FEMA to evaluate the amount of rent to be charged based on their financial ability.

FEMA will conduct outreach to assist occupants of temporary housing units with the documentation necessary to evaluate their ability to pay.

For more information on temporary housing, call the Individual Assistance Housing Hotline at 808-784-1600, contact 2-1-1 to reach the disaster case management program, or call FEMA Helpline at 800-621-3362 for assistance in other languages.
