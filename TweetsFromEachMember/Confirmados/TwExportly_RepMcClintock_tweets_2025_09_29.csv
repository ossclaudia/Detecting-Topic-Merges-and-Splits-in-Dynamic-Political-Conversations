Censure is formal punishment by the House and we have already gone too far down this road.  Omar’s comments were not made in the House and even if they were, they broke no House rules. A free society depends on tolerating ALL speech — even hateful speech — confident that the best way to sort good from evil is to put the two side by side and trust the people to know the difference. Congress exists for this purpose.

Judging by the narrow votes, we have pushed this bill about as far toward perfection as the process allows.
