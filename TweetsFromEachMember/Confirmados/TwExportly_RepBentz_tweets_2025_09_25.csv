'1938259102536253805',"Since PILT payments began in 1977, the U.S. Government, through the Department of Interior, has distributed more than $12.6 billion dollars. PILT makes sense, since the Government collects more than $20.7 billion in revenue ANNUALLY from commercial activities on public lands. Millions of acres of federal land are located in Oregon counties, but this land cannot be taxed. Nonetheless, these counties and the people in them shoulder the multitude of costs that benefit this land such as maintaining roads, schools, first responders, law enforcement, and fire protection. This PILT program helps defray some of the cost associated with maintaining these crucial services.

It is based on a bill introduced last year by Senator Ron Wyden.  It is a provisional bill, but it contains those elements needed to protect the land, plants, animals and communities that rely upon that land.  I want to thank the Senator for his personal involvement and for his staff’s work, and I look forward to successfully passing this bill out of the House within the next few weeks,” said Congressman Cliff Bentz.

“Congressman Bentz and I have been working together to pass Owyhee legislation before the end of the year. His announcement today of the upcoming hearing in the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands on his ""Oregon Owyhee Wilderness and Community Protection Act"" takes a significant step forward toward achieving that goal,” Senator Ron Wyden said. “I applaud Congressman Bentz’s thoughtful and constructive approach and am looking forward, as we continue to work together on this bill, to success on legislation that leaves the farmers, ranchers, preservationists, Tribes and all the residents of Eastern Oregon the true winners of the economic and preservation gains this legislative approach can achieve.”",en,Reply,0,1,0,1,352,2024-10-31 22:52:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
