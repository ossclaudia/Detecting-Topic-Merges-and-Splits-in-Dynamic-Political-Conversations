This bill would defund Planned Parenthood health centers, bar private health insurers on the ACA marketplace from offering abortion coverage, and slash Medicaid health care coverage — leaving over 300,000 Massachusetts residents unable to access basic health care services.

'1930005199244144657',"Yesterday, while ICE officials smugly touted the arrest of nearly 1,500 people in Massachusetts over the past month, I convened immigrant families from my district who have been unjustly harmed by Trump’s cruel and unlawful mass deportation agenda.

All across the Massachusetts 7th, ICE raids have robbed us of family members and our collective sense of security and belonging.

And the stories we heard were harrowing.

We heard from Kenia from Chelsea, who was driving to a Mother's Day church service with her husband Daniel when ICE agents in unmarked vehicles ambushed them, broke the passenger side window, forcefully extracted Daniel from the car, and slammed his face on the sidewalk while their three children watched in horror.

""We are devastated. No one should live through this,"" Kenia said. ""He needs to come home.""

We also heard from Mercedes, an East Boston resident, whose family is struggling after her husband Jose was arrested at work and detained for two days at an ICE facility in Burlington. Jose was living here legally with Temporary Protected Status but was told by the ICE agents who detained him that ""only people born here have rights.""

""We are deeply traumatized,"" she told us. ""My husband and I can't sleep. I'm afraid to go out. I'm afraid to take my daughter to school. Our 12-year-old daughter who was born in this country has anxiety attacks.""

And we heard from Yolanda, a Randolph resident, whose husband Santo was taken through the back exit of a police precinct and handed off to ICE officers, but not before he was mocked by the officers on duty and told to ""go meet his new family."" Santo was shipped off to a detention center in Louisiana, where he has struggled to control his diabetes and hypertension, and has reported that the medical staff and officers make fun of him because of his English and have failed to properly treat his conditions.

These horrific raids have never been about ""safety"" or ""law and order,"" as the Trump Administration claims — they have always been about terrorizing immigrant families, abusing power, and sowing fear in our communities.

They are absolutely shameful and in many cases, unlawful and in violation of folks' constitutional rights.

Donald Trump is a dictator who wants a citizenry that is inactive and indifferent to the suffering of their neighbors, including our immigrant families in the Massachusetts 7th. But we will not stand by while he and ICE carry out their unlawful mass deportation agenda and rip our families apart.

We stand with our immigrant neighbors. Children should not live in fear of their parents disappearing. And elders should not live in fear of going to the grocery store or their faith house.

She recently wrote to my office about the devastating impacts Republican Medicaid cuts would have for our postpartum patients and babies in the #MA7 and nationwide.

For Dr. Evans, these cuts would harm the patients she cares for, their families, and create large disruptions in finances for hospitals like hers that care for critically ill newborns.

“My patients deserve a well-funded Medicaid program,” she said.

In Massachusetts, Medicaid covers 39% of all children and pays for 32% of all births. The drastic cuts to Medicaid under Trump and Republicans’ bill would undermine Dr. Evans and her colleagues' ability to care for these infants and leave them ill-served.

In her words, “Medicaid is fundamental to children’s health and incredibly important for the babies in our state and district.”

'1905986896934949011',"This week, my Somerville constituent Rümeysa Öztürk was abducted in broad daylight by DHS officials and sent to Louisiana to be locked in a detention center. She has not been charged with any crime.

The video of her kidnapping is harrowing. Plainclothes officers wearing masks surrounded her, grabbed her by the wrists, took her phone away, and handcuffed her before taking her away in a vehicle.

She was on her way to break her Ramadan fast, so I can only imagine how hungry and afraid she was. She also does not have her asthma medications with her—a human rights violation.

This is unacceptable and she must be released immediately and have her visa restored NOW. 

Rümeysa is a peaceful protestor, a graduate student at Tufts University passionate about education, and my constituent who has a constitutional right to free speech and due process. She was here legally on a student visa, before it was unjustly revoked, and making numerous positive contributions to the Tufts and #MA7 community.

This administration is terrorizing students to silence dissent because that’s what a dictator does. And the only reason she was kidnapped is because she has a dissenting political view, different from Donald Trump’s. That’s it. 

This should be a five-alarm fire for anyone who cares about free speech and our democracy — regardless of your political party, ideology, or opinion on Israel, Palestine, or any other issue.
