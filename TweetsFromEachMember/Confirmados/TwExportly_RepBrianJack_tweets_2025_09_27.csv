Charlie was a Christian, a father, a son, and a leader with whom many of us enjoyed working.

Charlie led a movement that was organized through the simple principle of respectful political discourse.

The structure of each of his events was built around direct, civil dialogue across college campuses with America’s future leaders.

Until yesterday.

There is a growing ideology infecting our country that teaches its depraved adherents that people of different perspectives are not worthy of life.

We must defeat this evil, and serve swift justice to those who perpetrate it.

May Charlie Kirk forever Rest in Peace, and may his voice and approach to free speech be remembered for generations to come.",en,Tweet,1,46,4,17,1612,2025-09-11 21:17:31,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
