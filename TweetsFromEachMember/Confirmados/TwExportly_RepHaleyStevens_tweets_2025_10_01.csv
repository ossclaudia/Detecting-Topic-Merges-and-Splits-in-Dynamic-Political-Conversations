Sinwar as the leader of Hamas, jeopardized the safety and security of an entire region. His crimes led to the deaths of thousands in Israel and Gaza, sexual violation of women, and the suffering of millions. Today is a day of justice for his countless victims.

I pray that this moment, with elimination of Hamas’ leadership, may be a turning point in this war that leads to Hamas’ surrender, the release of hostages, and long-term peace, security, and self-determination for Palestinians and Israelis alike.",en,Tweet,0,35,6,27,2653,2024-10-18 03:24:05,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1846207748704555355',"Lilly Ledbetter was a giant in the fight for ensuring women are paid equally for equal work. After being paid less than men in the same position for decades, she worked to make sure it wouldn’t happen to others and was at President Obama’s side when he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law, making it easier for women to fight back against discriminatory pay. In honor of her legacy, I’m going to keep working in Congress so that women, especially women of color, are paid equally for their hard work.
