The DOJ’s Second Amendment Task Force should begin their first wave of litigation against Governor Polis and the state of Colorado for signing into law the unconstitutional SB25-003.

The Second Amendment is clear: SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED!

SB25-003 converts our constitutional rights into a privilege - one that becomes only accessible to those who can afford it. 

For many Coloradans, especially low-income citizens who have been terrorized by Tren de Aragua, SB25-003 creates a barrier that puts firearm ownership out of reach and renders them defenseless.
