'1956164675848003600',"Tomorrow, President Trump will meet with Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Here are some of my thoughts about that meeting:

1. It doesn’t appear that the President got anything in exchange from Putin to secure this meeting. Giving anyone a meeting with the President of the U.S., let alone a war criminal, should come with something in return or some assurances. Just trusting Putin to come with good intentions is the wrong idea.   

2. Russia thinks that we stole Alaska from them (we didn’t) so don’t give any of it back (I’m only sort of kidding about this).

3. Every negotiation isn’t about the financial bottom line. There are larger issues here that aren’t just about making a buck, issues that matter to keeping Americans safe. I’m not sure if the President sees that, but I hope the people around him do. 

4. If he can secure a ceasefire from the Russians in Ukraine that would be a very positive step.  I’m not optimistic, but I wish him well in this negotiation.

Maria was in Yuma because her son was leaving for training, her daughter-in-law had a hip surgery, and so they needed help watching her grandson. When she came back to the base after a grocery run, she was detained and reported to CBP. Now, she’s being held in an ICE facility. 

I remember how proud my parents were watching my brother and I get sworn into the Navy, so I asked her if she had been there when her son graduated from boot camp. She broke down in tears. All she could say was how proud of her son she was.
