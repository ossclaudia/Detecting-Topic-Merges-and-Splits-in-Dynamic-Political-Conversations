It is dishonest to weaponize fear—telling seniors that reform means abandonment. It doesn’t. It never has.

I want to reiterate my unwavering support for the State of Israel, its defense of its people, and the return of the hostages who have endured a year in darkness, facing unimaginable torture, starvation, and abuse. We must find a solution that brings them home and dismantles Iran’s terror network and its proxies.
 
What often gets lost in this conflict is the ongoing fragility Israel has faced throughout its existence. While Americans have come to know Israel as relatively secure over the past two decades, especially with the normalization of ties with Arab nations, it wasn’t always this way. I lived in Israel in 1978, before the peace brought by President Carter, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. That peace was real and impactful.
 
In recent weeks, Israel has brought to justice those who have harmed not only their nation but our citizens, too. That alone should solidify the United States’ deep and unwavering support.

'1839438109739544927',"I strongly condemn recent vandalism of Hindu temples in the U.S. Such acts of hate and intolerance have no place in our society, whether they are directed at people of any faith or race. 

We must stand united against all forms of hate and violence, including antisemitism, which is a far larger problem than we often acknowledge. Everyone deserves to worship freely and without fear. https://t.co/GeJkodGjVx",en,Tweet,0,16,2,5,1012,2024-09-26 23:53:15,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1839094691804889480',"I could not in good conscience vote in favor of the federal funding bill and continue the broken budget process. We are way outside of regular order. Congress has not followed our appropriations process since 1996, forcing us into a cycle of government shutdowns and last-minute omnibus bills. We need real solutions, not just more delays. It’s time to get our fiscal house in order and hold ourselves accountable, just like Utahns do every day in their own lives. https://t.co/EeJ08U6O8C",en,Tweet,0,18,5,7,1175,2024-09-26 01:08:37,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1838953545761980566',"Great Salt Lake Stewardship Act

Utahns have worked tirelessly to protect the Great Salt Lake, but persistent drought conditions now threaten its long-term viability. Recognizing the urgency of this issue, the Great Salt Lake Stewardship Act would expand the Colorado River water conservation program to include the lake. Over time, this flexibility will help safeguard its ecological and economic significance, protecting Utah and the West from the economic and public health risks of an ecological disaster.",en,Reply,0,6,1,1,369,2024-09-25 15:47:46,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Geothermal energy is an affordable, reliable, and clean energy source. Despite significant investments from companies to secure project permits, the Department of the Interior often delays authorizations—such as notices to proceed and drilling permits—due to litigation threats. Utah is a prime example of geothermal energy's potential, and we must unlock this resource to meet our energy needs.",en,Reply,0,9,2,1,412,2024-09-25 15:47:45,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
