Mr. Waltz emphasized the importance of moving towards a win-win relationship based on mutual security interests and enhanced trade.  Mr. Waltz noted that the decision to not renew the waiver of sanctions on Iranian electricity exports was consistent with President Trump’s “maximum pressure” strategy on Iran, and that pressure on Iran would increase if Iran continued to develop a nuclear weapons capability and support terrorism across the region, including in Iraq.  

Mr. Waltz welcomed the Iraqi Prime Minister’s efforts to achieve energy independence for Iraq, and encouraged the Iraqi government to welcome more western and U.S. energy companies into Iraq’s oil and gas sectors.  The National Security Advisor urged the Iraqi government to work with the Kurdistan Regional Government to address remaining contract disputes and pay arrears owed to U.S. energy companies, and also requested that the Iraqi government retain an investment coordinator to work with U.S. companies seeking to invest and operate in Iraq.
