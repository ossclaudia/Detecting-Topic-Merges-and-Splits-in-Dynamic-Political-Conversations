'1964455551007674468',"If #Churchill were faced with the threat posed to #Chicago by @POTUS he may have said:

More than half of a year has passed since this struggle entered its fiercest phase. What a cataract of calamity has descended upon us since then. The trust of the people in Washington and Los Angeles suppressed; their voices silenced beneath bluster; their free institutions mocked. Our allies in truth and democracy harried and betrayed. Entire communities of our nation, gutted and abandoned, their hopes of fraternity as brutally torn as any rampart in war.
Yet here in Chicago, we stand—undaunted, unbroken, resolute. 

If in January, one had told us that, after such disaster and shock, we should stand upright in September, masters of our own resolve, firm in the conviction of ultimate triumph, few would have credited it. Yet so it is. Where others faltered, Chicago has not wavered. We are stronger today—stronger in spirit, stronger in unity, stronger in the faith that justice shall prevail—than ever we have been before.

The Trump faction believed that the air of confusion, the tempest of words, could cow us—that by unbridled assault upon truth, they could drive us to submission. Yet the good men and women of Chicago have risen nobly, as never before. They have labored unceasingly, they have restored their strength, they have bristled their city against tyranny from within or from without. Chicago today is a fortress for Democrat, a beacon of hope, a sentinel of justice.

It is quite plain that Mr. Trump could not admit defeat in his assault upon the institutions of American democracy without sustaining the most serious injury. If, after all his vainglorious boastings, his dire threats, and the lurid accounts so loudly trumpeted across the nation of the triumphs he claims to have inflicted—of the vast numbers of crimes he alleges were committed, of the multitudes he insists have risen to his cause, and of the pitiful weakness of our civic order—if, after all these extravagant tales of Washington and Los Angeles laid low, their citizens panic-stricken and despairing of their government, if, after such a torrent of words, his whole offensive should, in the end, be forced to dwindle and fade into nothingness, the gentleman’s reputation for veracity, slender though it already is, would suffer the most grievous discredit. 

We may be sure, therefore, that he will persist as long as strength and circumstance allow, and as long as the manifold preoccupations of his legal entanglements with Epstein are in need of diversion from public purview and discourse.

On the other hand, the Patriotic spirit of free men and women has increased in vigour. Our capacity for endurance is already shown to exceed theirs. Each falsehood, once unmasked, becomes a weapon against him. Each scheme revealed serves not his cause, but ours.

And so I say this: The gratitude of every home in Chicago, of every family that lifts its head in freedom, of every heart across this nation that esteems liberty above servitude, goes forth to those few champions of truth and courage, who against overwhelming odds, in the heat of this mighty trial, turn the tide by their devotion.

But that progress is under threat. Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are pushing an extreme agenda that would rip health care away from over 15 million Americans, slash protections, and drive up costs—just to give more tax breaks to the wealthy.

The repeated targeting of Black women in the media is a particularly egregious tactic meant to intimidate, silence, and undermine their crucial contributions to our national discourse. We saw this with the baseless attacks on journalists like @Yamiche @AprilDRyan and @abbydphillip during the previous administration, and it is deeply concerning to see this pattern continue.

I commend Jasmine Wright for her professionalism and refusal to be intimidated. As a Member of Congress, I will continue to speak out against these attacks and advocate for a media environment where all journalists, regardless of their race or gender, can report the facts without fear of harassment or denigration.

'1915130335618359766',"As I reflect on the monumental career of Senator Dick Durbin, I am filled with admiration for a leader who has devoted over 40 years to public service and the betterment of our great state of Illinois. Today, as he announces his retirement, I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations and profound gratitude for his tremendous contributions to our nation.

Senator Durbin’s legacy is one that transcends partisanship; it is a testament to unwavering dedication, tenacity, and a fierce commitment to justice. Throughout his tenure, he has been a tireless advocate for working families, championing issues such as the expansion of access to affordable healthcare through the Affordable Care Act, which has provided millions of Americans with essential coverage. His efforts to reform our immigration system, including the introduction of the DREAM Act, demonstrate his compassionate approach to complex societal challenges, offering hope to countless young immigrants seeking opportunity and a pathway to citizenship.

One of his most significant achievements has been his relentless fight to secure funding for education, ensuring that every child has access to quality schooling. His commitment to investing in education from preschool to higher education has empowered generations, fostering a more educated and skilled workforce.

Senator Durbin has also played a pivotal role in advocating for social justice and civil rights. His work on criminal justice reform, particularly in addressing racial disparities and promoting rehabilitation over incarceration, has sparked critical conversations and paved the way for necessary changes in our justice system. 

Additionally, his leadership in the Senate has been instrumental in advancing legislation to combat climate change and protect the environment, championing policies that prioritize sustainability and conservation for future generations.

I have had the honor of working alongside him, witnessing firsthand the tireless efforts he has put into uplifting the voices of the marginalized and fighting for the rights of all Americans.

'1900251790634795239',"BREAKING: Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson Applauds Federal Judge’s Order to Reinstate Federal Workers Unlawfully Fired by Elon Musk

Washington, D.C. (March 13, 2025) — Today, Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson (IL-01) released the following statement in response to a federal judge’s ruling ordering the immediate reinstatement of federal employees unjustly terminated by Elon Musk and DOGE, including workers in the Department of Defense, the Department of Treasury, and the Department of Veterans Affairs:

“This ruling is a victory for working families, the rule of law, and the fundamental rights of our nation’s public servants. Across Illinois’ First Congressional District, thousands of federal employees, including VA nurses, postal workers, and transit safety inspectors, serve our communities with dedication. The unlawful terminations orchestrated by Elon Musk and rubber-stamped by the Trump-Musk Administration were a direct attack on these workers and their families.

“The court’s decision is clear: these public servants must be reinstated immediately. That includes the many essential employees in Illinois who help provide critical services—from maintaining our national parks to ensuring that our veterans receive the care they deserve. These are real people with real families, and their livelihoods should never have been jeopardized for political gain.

“I stand with my colleagues on the Oversight Committee in holding the Trump-Musk Administration accountable for their blatant disregard of labor laws. We will not allow their reckless and unlawful actions to undermine the stability of our federal workforce. In Illinois alone, over 8,000 federal employees contribute daily to essential services, and I will continue fighting to protect their jobs, their rights, and their dignity.”",en,Tweet,0,5,3,0,355,2025-03-13 18:25:06,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

She wasn’t just a conductor of the Underground Railroad—she was a fighter, a healer, a leader, and a woman of deep faith. She risked everything to lead dozens of enslaved people to freedom, without ever getting caught. But did you know she was also a Civil War spy, a nurse, a suffragist, and a mother?

Born Araminta “Minty” Ross in Maryland, she later took the name Harriet after her mother. When she realized she was about to be sold, she made the impossible choice to leave everything behind—including her husband—to find freedom. And she didn’t stop there. Time and time again, she went back to bring others to safety, guided only by her instincts and an unshakable belief that she was doing God’s work. #HarrietTubmanDay #Courage #Legacy",en,Tweet,0,2,1,0,185,2025-03-10 14:33:35,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Glr6xH_XwAAM0C1.jpg

'1890068183173767604',"Yesterday, I proudly stood alongside @RepPressley  as she reintroduced H.R. 40, the bill to establish a federal commission to study and develop reparations proposals for Black Americans. This fight for justice has been generations in the making, and I am honored to carry forward the legacy of Congressman John Conyers and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who championed this legislation for decades.

For over 400 years, Black Americans have faced systemic racial oppression—from slavery to Jim Crow to present-day disparities in wealth, housing, healthcare, and education. H.R. 40 isn’t just about studying history—it’s about ensuring our nation finally reckons with its past and takes steps toward restorative justice.

Reparations are not a radical idea—they are a moral and economic necessity. The racial wealth gap remains staggering: White households hold nearly 10 times the wealth of Black households, and systemic discrimination in housing, lending, and education continues to this day.

I fully support H.R. 40 because America must acknowledge and address the harm it has inflicted. Justice demands action.

'1873545377288523836',"Statement from Congressman Jonathan Jackson on the Passing of Former President Jimmy Carter

Today, we grieve the passing of Former President Jimmy Carter, a leader of unparalleled integrity and compassion who devoted his life to the pursuit of justice, equality, and peace. At 100 years old, he leaves behind a legacy that profoundly shaped our nation and the world.

President Carter’s dedication to civil rights was evident in his actions both before and during his presidency. As Governor of Georgia, he called for an end to segregation and publicly declared that the time for racial discrimination had passed. His bold leadership in the South during a time of immense tension sent a powerful message of inclusion and progress.

As president, Jimmy Carter demonstrated a deep commitment to addressing systemic inequalities affecting Black communities. His administration significantly increased federal appointments of African Americans to high-ranking positions, creating opportunities for representation in spaces of power. He also expanded funding for historically Black colleges and universities, understanding that education is a cornerstone of opportunity.

President Carter worked closely with my father, Reverend Jesse Jackson, to empower marginalized communities and advance the cause of economic justice. Their collaboration helped secure greater access to federal resources for minority-owned businesses, particularly through the Minority Business Development Agency, which Carter strengthened during his presidency. Together, they emphasized the importance of uplifting underserved communities through economic inclusion, employment opportunities, and community investment.

Beyond his presidency, President Carter continued to work alongside civil rights leaders like my father. He joined efforts to mediate racial and economic disparities, offering his wisdom and influence to bring people together in pursuit of equality. His efforts through the Carter Center tackled issues like voter suppression, housing insecurity, and global poverty, which disproportionately affect communities of color. His hands-on involvement with Habitat for Humanity built not just homes, but hope, for families striving for a better future.

President Carter’s moral leadership and tangible actions remind us that true progress requires not just words but deeds. He transformed the presidency into a platform for service and ensured that the fight for civil rights remained central to the American story.

On behalf of the constituents of Illinois’ 1st District, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Carter family and to all those mourning this extraordinary man. May we honor his legacy by continuing his work to build a world where justice, dignity, and opportunity are within reach for all.

Rest in peace, President Carter. Your life’s work will forever inspire us.",en,Tweet,0,5,3,1,1465,2024-12-30 01:43:21,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgArdz0WYAAyhGH.jpg

Washington, D.C. — Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson issued a powerful statement today in response to the acquittal of Daniel Penny, who faced charges related to the death of Jordan Neely, a young Black man experiencing a mental health crisis on a New York City subway.

“The outcome of this trial forces us to confront troubling questions about the society we are becoming. Is this who we are? Are we willing to accept a new normal where vigilantes feel entitled to take justice into their own hands, especially when it comes to Black lives?

Jordan Neely’s story is a heartbreaking reminder of the challenges faced by individuals living with mental health struggles. He deserved compassion, care, and assistance—not a violent end. The decision to acquit Daniel Penny sends a dangerous signal: that some lives, particularly Black lives, can be devalued without consequence.

This verdict mirrors systemic disparities we’ve seen time and again. Consider how frequently Black men are subjected to harsh penalties for less severe actions. Cases like Albert Wilson and Kalief Browder underscore the glaring inequities in our justice system. Meanwhile, individuals like Penny, who take lethal action, are absolved. We must ask ourselves how we reconcile these outcomes with our claims of justice and equality.”
“America has always been a nation that wrestles with its conscience. Today, I urge us all to rise above fear and indifference, to embrace our better angels, and to reaffirm the value of every human life.

The killing of Jordan Neely should never have happened. It speaks to a failure on many levels: a failure of compassion, a failure of public systems to provide adequate mental health support, and a failure of the justice system to ensure accountability.

No one struggling with a mental health crisis should face violence instead of help. No Black life should be so easily disregarded. As a nation, we must reckon with this and commit to charting a different course.”

“This tragic case highlights urgent areas for action. As members of Congress, it is our responsibility to address the underlying issues that allow these injustices to persist.
1. Increase Oversight on the Use of Force:
Pass legislation that establishes      stricter standards for holding individuals accountable when they use      lethal force outside the boundaries of the law.
2. Improve Mental Health Support Systems:
Expand funding for crisis      intervention programs and mental health resources, particularly for      underserved communities.

Prioritize the passage of the Mental      Health Equity Act, which aims to address mental health disparities in      communities of color.

3. Curtail Vigilantism:
Strengthen federal penalties for      individuals who engage in extrajudicial violence, ensuring that no one      takes the law into their own hands without consequences.

4. Reform the Justice System:
Support legislation like the George      Floyd Justice in Policing Act to address racial bias and inequity in      the legal process.

5. Promote Community-Based Solutions:
Increase investments in programs      that provide non-violent responses to mental health crises, including      mobile crisis response units and peer support networks.”

6. Address Veterans’ Mental Health Needs:
Adding complexity to this tragedy is Daniel Penny’s status as a military veteran. Veterans are among our nation’s most respected citizens, yet too often they face severe challenges, including mental health crises that go unaddressed. Congress must take proactive steps to ensure that veterans receive comprehensive mental health support. It is imperative to provide the necessary resources to prevent any veteran from contributing to or being caught in such devastating situations. The tragic loss of Jordan Neely is a reminder of Congress's responsibility to protect its citizens, invest in mental health services, and reform judicial inequities.

To this end, legislators like Congressmen David Trone and Ro Khanna have sponsored critical measures to address mental health needs, including:

The Occupational Therapy Mental      Health Parity Act, which enhances access to occupational therapy for mental health      under Medicare, ensuring veterans and others can access holistic,      life-improving services.
H.R. 2067, the Medication Access and      Training Expansion (MATE) Act, designed to improve training for      treating substance use disorders, which are closely tied to mental health      issues.

These legislative efforts emphasize the need for targeted support systems for veterans, addressing underlying issues such as PTSD, anxiety, and societal reintegration challenges.

Advocate for national standards      in crisis response, ensuring trained professionals—not civilians—intervene      in mental health emergencies.

Expand funding for community      mental health programs and veterans' mental health services to prevent      tragedies like this.

Congress must increase funding      for veterans’ mental health services through the Department of Veterans      Affairs (VA), including therapy, counseling, and crisis intervention.

Support legislation that expands      training for veterans transitioning to civilian life, focusing on      de-escalation and understanding mental health crises in the community.

By addressing veterans’ mental health needs comprehensively, we can ensure that our heroes receive the care they deserve while also helping to prevent situations where unresolved trauma may lead to tragedy.

“The acquittal of Daniel Penny is not just a failure of the courts—it is a failure of our collective humanity. This moment calls on all of us to reflect and act. Allowing tragedies like this to become the norm is unacceptable.
The time has come to renew our commitment to protecting the vulnerable, ensuring justice for the marginalized, and reaffirming the inherent dignity of every person.
Jordan Neely’s life mattered. Black lives matter. And as a nation, we must do better to honor that truth.”",en,Tweet,0,3,3,2,486,2024-12-09 22:01:51,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeY5FZZXoAAekBw.jpg

Jackson (IL-01) today expressed his strong support for Congressman Sean Casten’s (IL-06) letter to the leadership of the House Ethics Committee, calling for the immediate release of the committee’s report on allegations against former Rep. Matt Gaetz. Nearly 100 House Democrats have signed the letter, which urges transparency and accountability in response to serious allegations against Gaetz, particularly as he is under consideration by former President Donald Trump for the role of U.S. Attorney General.

“Matt Gaetz’s actions have raised grave concerns about his fitness for public office, and it is critical that the House Ethics Committee release its findings so that the American people can have full visibility into the investigation,” said Congressman Jackson. “As former Rep. Gaetz’s name is being floated for such a significant and powerful position in a future administration, it is vital that we address these allegations with the seriousness and transparency they deserve. We cannot allow a person with these unanswered questions to ascend to such a high office. I stand with my colleagues in calling for the Ethics Committee to release its report and hold former Rep. Gaetz accountable for his actions.”

The letter, signed by nearly 100 House Democrats, comes as the confirmation of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General would mark a significant and troubling shift in the nation’s leadership. The lawmakers are urging the House Ethics Committee to release its report without delay to ensure transparency and to inform the public about the ongoing investigation into Gaetz’s conduct.

Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson Joins Ranking Member @repdavidscott  in Urging Swift Action on #DisasterAid for #Farmers and Families

Washington, D.C. – [11/19/2024]  Today, Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson (IL-01) joined Ranking Member David Scott (GA-13) in calling for immediate action from Congress to provide critical disaster aid to farmers and families affected by recent natural disasters. Congressman Jackson issued a statement urging lawmakers to prioritize relief efforts and pass a comprehensive disaster aid package to assist agricultural communities that are struggling to recover from severe weather events, including floods, hurricanes, and droughts.

“The devastation caused by recent natural disasters has left farmers and rural families across the country in urgent need of support,” said Congressman Jonathan Jackson. “These hardworking men and women are the backbone of our nation's agricultural industry, and it's our responsibility to ensure they have the resources to rebuild and continue their vital work. I stand with Ranking Member David Scott and my colleagues in calling for swift, comprehensive disaster relief that will provide farmers with the financial assistance and tools they need to recover, rebuild, and ensure food security for future generations.”

“From #Georgia to #Illinois, from cornfields to cotton fields, communities are reeling from the effects of storms and droughts. This is not just an agricultural issue, it’s an economic and humanitarian issue. We must pass disaster relief to help these families regain their feet and rebuild stronger than before.”

Congressman Jackson and Ranking Member Scott have also committed to working with their colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that disaster aid reaches those who need it most and that the relief measures are as effective and timely as possible.

“Now is the time for Congress to come together and put people over politics,” Jackson continued. “We cannot afford to let these critical relief efforts be delayed. Our farmers' and rural families' lives and livelihoods depend on it.”

The call for swift action comes as lawmakers prepare for upcoming votes on disaster relief legislation, and Jackson and Scott are committed to pushing for a comprehensive solution that meets the needs of affected communities nationwide.

Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson Demands Immediate
Stay of Execution for #RobertRoberson

Washington, D.C. – Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson today called for an immediate stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who is scheduled to be executed in Texas. Congressman Jackson emphasized the urgent need for a thorough review of Roberson's case, citing significant concerns about the fairness of his trial and the evidence used to convict him.

""Robert Roberson's case raises serious questions about the integrity of our justice system,"" said Congressman Jackson. ""We cannot allow an execution to proceed when there are substantial doubts about the validity of the conviction. It is imperative that we ensure every individual receives a fair trial and that justice is truly served.""

Congressman Jackson highlighted several key issues in Roberson's case, including the use of outdated and discredited forensic science, as well as the lack of adequate legal representation. He urged the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Governor Greg Abbott to grant a stay of execution and allow for a comprehensive review of the case.

""Our justice system must be based on fairness and accuracy,"" Congressman Jackson continued. ""Executing Robert Roberson without addressing these critical concerns would be a grave miscarriage of justice. I implore the authorities to halt this execution and ensure that justice is upheld.""

Congressman Jackson remains committed to advocating for justice and fairness in the criminal justice system and will continue to fight for the rights of those who have been wrongfully convicted.

MI Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II, MN Attorney General Keith Ellison, NY Attorney General Tish James, And Congressman Jonathon L. Jackson Join Other Elected Officials, Workers, Employers, and Economic Justice Organizers from Around the Country to Celebrate Michigan’s Bold Step in Raising Wages and Ending Subminimum Wages
 
Media Planning to Attend In Person or Virtually is Kindly Asked to RSVP here
 
#Detroit, MI —As the 2024 elections approach, one issue remains central to both the economy and the path to victory: wages. The rising cost of living has left millions of workers struggling to make ends meet, making jobs with living wages a top priority for working class voters across the country. Just two months ago, the Supreme Court in the battleground state of Michigan made history by ruling to raise wages for 1.2 million workers to $15 by 2028, while also ending the subminimum wage for workers with disabilities, youth and  tipped employees—an outdated and unjust practice that was created after Emancipation to allow restaurants to hire newly-freed Black workers for free. The ruling makes Michigan the first state East of the MIssissippi to end this legacy of slavery.
On October 15, 2024, from 10:00 - 11:00 AM EDT, @onefairwage in collaboration with People’s Action and @MichiganUnitedAction will bring together Lieutenant Governors, Attorney Generals, national civil rights leaders and representation from various labor and advocacy organizations for a celebration of #Michigan’s historic victory for workers, uplifting the significance of Michigan’s leadership on wage reform and the importance of wage equity in this year’s Presidential election. The event will highlight Michigan’s leadership role in economic justice, the growing momentum across the country, and how this victory will be a key issue in upcoming elections. The audience will have an opportunity to engage our leaders and engage in meaningful dialog.
WHO:
•Michigan Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II
•Minnesota Attorney General @keithellison Ellison
•Congressman Jonathon Jackson (IL-01)
•@PortiaRobeson , Chief Executive Officer, Focus of Hope 
•New York Attorney General @TishJames James (virtual)
•Additional labor leaders and workers who will speak about the direct impact of the wage increase and the end of subminimum wages.
 
**NOTE: Workers will be available to speak to the media on the importance of wages in their voting decisions in this year’s Presidential election. **
 
WHEN: October 15, 2024, 10:00 - 11:00 AM EDT 
WHERE: Please RSVP here. Location details will be provided upon RSVP. 
This event marks a pivotal moment in the fight for living wages, as Michigan’s Supreme Court ruling sets the stage for national wage reform efforts. With the elimination of the subminimum wage for tipped workers—a practice with roots in systemic inequality—Michigan is leading the charge in ensuring fair compensation for all workers. This victory is expected to have broad implications for the labor movement and wage policies across the U.S., particularly as the issue of economic justice takes center stage in the upcoming election cycle. Journalists will have the opportunity to hear directly from elected officials and labor advocates about the next steps in the movement and how other states may follow Michigan’s lead.
In addition to remarks from the featured speakers, the event will include first hand stories from workers impacted by the wage increase, offering powerful perspectives on how these changes are improving lives and communities.

Born on June 25, 1966, in Kinshasa, #Zaire, Mutombo was one of ten children. His father, an educator, ensured that his children had access to good schools. Dikembe’s early dreams were of becoming a doctor, and he eventually mastered nine languages, including French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and five Central African dialects.

His journey from #Kinshasa to the NBA is a testament to his determination and resilience.  Mutombo was a four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and an eight-time All-Star. His iconic finger wag and relentless defense made him a household name, but it was his humanitarian efforts that truly defined his legacy.

He dedicated his life to improving health and education in his native Democratic Republic of #Congo. Through the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation, he built the Biamba Marie Mutombo Hospital, providing critical healthcare services to thousands. His initiatives included free cervical and breast cancer screenings, knee and cataract surgeries.

As a UNICEF global ambassador and a tireless advocate, Dikembe’s impact was felt worldwide. His work with the NBA Cares program and various international relief agencies showcased his unwavering commitment to making the world a better place.

Rest in peace, @officialmutombo  Your impact will be felt for generations to come.  #RIPDikembe #Legend #Humanitarian #NBA #NotInMyHouse #MountMutombo  #DRC #DemocraticRepublicOfCongo",en,Tweet,0,1,0,1,235,2024-09-30 17:44:45,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>","#DikembeMutombo,#Zaire",,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYvKBppWYAAqB9j.jpg
'1840763120085549205',"Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson calls for the Censure of Rep. Clay Higgins after Racist remarks against Haitians

Louisiana and Haiti have a shared history. Today, we should be celebrating and reflecting upon the rich and intertwined heritage of these connected cultures. These two regions, though separated by the Gulf of Mexico, share a bond that has profoundly shaped their cultures, economies, and identities.

In 1791, enslaved Africans in Haiti rose against their oppressors, leading to the first successful slave rebellion in history. This revolution culminated in Haiti becoming the first independent Black republic in 1804.
The impact of this Revolution extended far beyond the island’s shores. France, weakened by the loss of its most profitable colony sold the vast Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803. This acquisition doubled the size of America and opened up the continent for westward expansion. There would be no America as we know it, without Haiti.

The connections between Haiti and Louisiana are deeply cultural. Following the Revolution, many refugees, including free people of color, planters, and enslaved individuals, fled to Louisiana, particularly New Orleans. They brought with them their customs, cuisine, music, and religious practices, which have since become integral to the cultural fabric of Louisiana. The word “Gumbo” itself comes from the West African word “ki ngombo,” which translates to okra.

The influence of Haitian culture is evident in the vibrant Creole cuisine, the rhythms of jazz, and the spiritual practices of Voodoo. The architecture of the French Quarter bears the mark of this shared heritage and Creole languages reflect their common roots in French colonialism and African heritage.

This shared history is what makes the words of Louisiana Congressman Clay Higgins all the more disgusting, abhorrent, and despicable. Congressman Higgins posted on his official account:

""LOL, These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters... but damned if they don’t feel all sophisticated now, filing charges against our President and VP, All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th”

These comments represent a new low even for Extreme MAGA Republicans. Higgins, a former policeman and sheriff's deputy in St. Landry Parish was disciplined by his commanding officer in Opelousas after he struck a handcuffed Black man and then lied about it amid an internal probe. He has bragged about voting for and supporting Klansman David Duke. In 2020, when protesters marched to bring justice for Breonna Taylor he used his official House account to post:

“If this shows up, we’ll consider the armed presence a real threat,” ""I'd drop any 10 of you where you stand,"" ""Nothing personal. We just eliminate the threat. We don't care what color you are. We don't care if you're left or right. if you show up like this, if We recognize a threat...you won't walk away.""

What’s worse, is not the sentiments of Mr. Higgins but the response from his fellow Republicans. As Martin Luther King, Jr. once said “History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.” Mr. Higgins holds deep-seated fears and hatred of people who do not look like him. But the silence of Republican leadership has been so much more deafening and hurtful.

I call on Speaker of the House Johnson and the leaders of the Republican Party to join us in condemning Congressman Higgins; additionally, I join my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus in calling for the censure of the Member. His statements violate the House Rules regarding the conduct of a member and put the lives of millions of Haitians, other immigrants, and people of color in danger.

Speaker Johnson has said that Mr. Higgins has prayed on the issues and has atoned for his statement saying “I’m sure he probably regrets some of the language he used. But you know, we move forward. We believe in redemption around here.” However, Mr. Higgins has shown no such remorse saying:

· “It’s all true!”
· “I can put up another controversial post tomorrow if you want me to. I mean, we do have freedom of speech. I’ll say what I want.”
· “It’s not a big deal to me. It’s like something stuck to the bottom of my boot. Just scrape it off and move on with my life.”

Mr. Higgins and his Project 2025, Extreme MAGA Republican allies are intent on doubling down and tripling down of hateful rhetoric and division. For this reason, the House of Representatives must act with one voice and vote to censure Representative Higgins.

'1838992344013488575',"CONGRESSMAN JONATHAN L. JACKSON CALLS FOR REFORM AFTER #BIPARTISAN #SENATE REPORT ON #SECRETSERVICE FAILURES

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE0

Date: September 25, 2024
Senate Releases Bipartisan Report on Secret Service Failures During Assassination Attempt on Former President @realDonaldTrump 

Washington, D.C. – Today, the U.S. @SenateHomeland  Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, along with the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released a bipartisan interim report detailing significant security failures by the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) during the July 13, 2024, assassination attempt on former President Donald J. Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.

In response to this report, Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson stated:

There is no place for violence in American politics. That is why I joined with my colleagues in the House to approve additional funding for the U.S. Secret Service unanimously. But funding alone is not enough, the Secret Service needs significant reforms. In addition to the multiple attempts and plots against the former President, we have seen a rise in threats against Supreme Court Justices and other elected officials and candidates for office.

Additionally, we must lower the temperature of American political discourse. We said this after the attempted assassination of Congresswoman @GabbyGiffords , we said the same thing after the attempted assassination of Congressman @SteveScalise, and we said the same thing after the FIRST attempted assassination of former President Trump. The stakes are too high for us to continue business as usual. Not only are our lives on the line, but our republic is also on the line. If we fall into government based on violence, threats, fear, and intimidation; we lose the last bastion of freedom, liberty, and justice in the world.

America is the last best hope for a better world, we cannot allow political division and violence to destroy the dreams of our founder.”

The report also includes recommendations to improve the Secret Service’s protective mission, emphasizing the need for better communication, enhanced coordination with other law enforcement agencies, and upgraded technology and resources.
