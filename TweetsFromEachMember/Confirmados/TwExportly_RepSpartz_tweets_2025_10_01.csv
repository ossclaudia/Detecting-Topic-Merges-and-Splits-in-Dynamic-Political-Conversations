Cleveland Clinic received $1B to cut drug prices—instead, it paid “22 of its executives more than $1 million and another 30 over $500,000,” and still had $1 billion in net income.

Erlanger Hospital spent millions on stadium-naming rights in spite of “severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns.”

'1924525027828941271',"Here is an example of how the provider tax scams work:

In a state, hospitals could agree to pay $10 million in provider taxes, and the state would increase Medicaid payments to hospitals by $20 million 

(not necessarily improving any benefits for the recipients - recently in IN $2.6B of Medicaid dollars were diverted by hospitals from the seniors in nursing homes).

Assuming the state had a 75% FMAP, the state would then receive $15 million in federal Medicaid matching funds (75% of $20 million).

As a result:

- hospitals would gain $10 million ($20 million in increased Medicaid payments minus $10 million in tax payments), 

- the state would gain $5 million ($25 million from the hospitals and the federal government minus the $20 million paid to the hospitals), 

and the federal government would pay  $15 million.",en,Tweet,4,103,31,26,5606,2025-05-19 18:58:17,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1893809859591631201',"Why I am a NO on the current version of the house budget instructions - I have a TRILLION DOLLAR QUESTION - where is the money - $1T? 

Interesting FACT: roughly 85% of spending is not ever even looked at by Congress - convenient if you would like to hide waste, fraud and abuse.

I appreciate @chiproytx and @RepArrington for their efforts to move savings from 150B to maybe 200B per year, but even if we take out the 460B increase in social security spending since 2019, even if we adjust the budget for high inflation caused by this outrageous spending (roughly 23% in 5 years), and additional Medicare enrollment of 5M seniors since 2019 adjusted for inflation, we are still about 1.2T per year short = 7T (2024) - ADJ 5.8T (4.5T (2019 spending) + 0.46T (increase in social security) + 0.78T (inflation adjustment for non-social security spending) + 0.08T increase in the number of Medicare recipients adjusted for inflation). If we only search for up to 0.2T, we still have $1 TRILLION per year unexplained. I have a responsibility to the people I represent to find $1T of their hard earned money! 

Some interesting observations: 

1) Federal spending per each Medicare recipient almost doubled in 5 years (about 80% increase per person or additional 500B PER YEAR)! I do not hear from the seniors in my district that quality of it doubled - on the contrary - many complaints about Medicare Advantage, reduction in physician’s fees and dishonest billing by large hospitals; and 

2) Federal spending per each Medicaid recipient increased more than 60% since the ACA expansion in 2014 (or over 100B per year adjusted for inflation). I also do not hear in my district that the quality of Medicaid significantly increased. On the contrary, people with disabilities,  Medicaid was originally intended for, get less and less services. 

Congress must have answers, since we never even look at this automatic spending.",en,Tweet,28,916,232,150,89918,2025-02-23 23:47:10,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
