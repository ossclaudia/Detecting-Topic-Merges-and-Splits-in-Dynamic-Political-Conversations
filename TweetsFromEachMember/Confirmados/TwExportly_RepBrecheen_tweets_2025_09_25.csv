While CRs are never optimal, given that we need seven Democrat votes to pass any funding bills in the Senate, I believe that passing this CR was our best play for minimizing spending. The other option was a government shutdown. The seven Democrats will want increased spending in certain areas if we go down a path of modifications, and that will lead to greater deficit spending. If we maintain current levels for this next year, it results in a savings of $500 billion over the next ten years, as it allows inflation to work against typical growth of government year over year.",en,Tweet,0,15,2,15,825,2025-09-19 17:49:01,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing,' shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.

James 3:8-18
But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison. With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God; from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way. Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water? Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh. Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy. And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

Quote by Charles Spurgeon 
“For us to hate those who are in error, or talk of them with contempt or wish them ill, or do them wrong, is not according to the Spirit of Christ. You cannot cast out Satan by Satan, nor correct error by violence, nor overcome hate by hate. The conquering weapon of the Christian is love.”",en,Reply,0,6,0,0,313,2025-09-14 14:42:32,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1967222415689183286',"Galatians 5:7-9; 13-26
You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth? This persuasion did not come from Him who calls you. A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough. For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, ""You shall love your neighbor as yourself."" But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one. 

Ephesians 4:14-15; 18-20; 30-32
As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn Christ in this way? Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.

Ephesians 6:11-19
Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel.",en,Reply,0,4,0,0,110,2025-09-14 14:42:27,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1967222333145600118',"2 Corinthians 10:3-5
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, on the righteous and the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

Romans 13:1-5
Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.

1 Corinthians 13:1-8
If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing. Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away.",en,Reply,0,3,0,0,100,2025-09-14 14:42:08,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1967222145643085842',"Reposting this important message:

It has been a difficult week for our country. Despite hatred, murder, and violence making headlines, we’re all resolved that good will triumph over evil!

As you know, on Wednesday, September 10th, 2025, a gunman assassinated Charlie Kirk during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. Charlie was only 31 years old and left behind a precious family that includes his wife and two young children. 

As we process Charlie's death, as well as the death of Iryna Zarutska and the homicide of an elderly couple from Oklahoma, we must consider what these acts of evil mean for us as a country. We have to look up. There is a quote by Charles Spurgeon that hangs on my office wall that I have stared at a few times this week: ""You cannot cast out Satan by Satan, nor correct error by violence, nor overcome hate by hate. The conquering weapon of the Christian is love."" 

Our country is in the middle of a physical struggle as well as a spiritual battle that is occurring in our hearts. On the physical front, our government must ensure that public safety, the rule of law, and freedom of speech continue to be advanced without retreat or fear. As the Proverb reminds us, “The wicked man flees though no man pursues, yet the righteous are as bold as a lion.”

As Charlie Kirk often reminded us, self-governance is key to our U.S. form of government. Charlie often quoted President John Adams, who, in 1798, wrote to the Massachusetts Militia saying: “We have no Government armed with Power capable of contending with human Passions unbridled by morality and Religion. Avarice, Ambition, Revenge or Gallantry, would break the strongest Cords of our Constitution as a Whale goes through a Net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

Charlie rightly knew that the limited government that our Founders handed us only works if it is in tandem with the self-governance of our personal actions. This week has shown us how self-governance is under attack from the lack of virtue in personal conduct. This is why spiritual inventory must be renewed in our country.

While fighting on the spiritual front as individuals, we must continue to speak the truth in love. Real love cannot be without truth, and real truth cannot be absent from love. (See below…1 Corinthians 13:1-8) 

I pray that Charlie's death acts as a turning point for our nation, that our culture will take personal inventory, and that starts in each individual heart (including my own). Below are some scriptures I have been mulling over that I hope are valuable to you in your personal reflections: 

1 John 4:20

We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, on the righteous and the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

Romans 13:1-5
Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.

1 Corinthians 13:1-8
If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing. Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away.",en,Reply,0,5,0,2,122,2025-09-14 01:22:29,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1967020750763614535',"It has been a difficult week for our country. Despite hatred, murder, and violence making headlines, we’re all resolved that good will triumph over evil!

As you know, on Wednesday, September 10th, 2025, a gunman assassinated Charlie Kirk during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. Charlie was only 31 years old and left behind a precious family that includes his wife and two young children.

As we process Charlie's death, as well as the death of Iryna Zarutska and the homicide of an elderly couple from Oklahoma, we must consider what these acts of evil mean for us as a country. We have to look up. There is a quote by Charles Spurgeon that hangs on my office wall that I have stared at a few times this week: ""You cannot cast out Satan by Satan, nor correct error by violence, nor overcome hate by hate. The conquering weapon of the Christian is love."" 

Our country is in the middle of a physical struggle as well as a spiritual battle that is occurring in our hearts. On the physical front, our government must ensure that public safety, the rule of law, and freedom of speech continue to be advanced without retreat or fear. As the Proverb reminds us, “The wicked man flees though no man pursues, yet the righteous are as bold as a lion.”

As Charlie Kirk often reminded us, self-governance is key to our U.S. form of government. Charlie often quoted President John Adams, who, in 1798, wrote to the Massachusetts Militia saying: “We have no Government armed with Power capable of contending with human Passions unbridled by morality and Religion. Avarice, Ambition, Revenge or Gallantry, would break the strongest Cords of our Constitution as a Whale goes through a Net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

Charlie rightly knew that the limited government that our Founders handed us only works if it is in tandem with the self-governance of our personal actions. This week has shown us how self-governance is under attack from the lack of virtue in personal conduct. This is why spiritual inventory must be renewed in our country.

While fighting on the spiritual front as individuals, we must continue to speak the truth in love. Real love cannot be without truth, and real truth cannot be absent from love. (See below…1 Corinthians 13:1-8) 

I pray that Charlie's death acts as a turning point for our nation, that our culture will take personal inventory, and that starts in each individual heart (including my own). Below are some scriptures I have been mulling over that I hope are valuable to you in your personal reflections:",en,Tweet,3,42,9,13,3276,2025-09-14 01:21:07,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0xC8fWWkAAcTBv.jpg

May the peace and comfort of the Lord be with them! I had the honor of first encountering Dr. Dobson over 20 years ago in his support of Tom Coburn. I grew up listening to Dr. Dobson on the radio and spent some time with his son, Ryan, at Kanakuk Kamps. For all who read his books or tuned into his programs, Dr. Dobson not only taught generations of us greater knowledge regarding family dynamics but he also shaped our political landscape using biblical wisdom. He was a watchmen on the wall for America!!! Please join me in praying for Dr. Dobson’s family and friends as we mourn the passing of a very good man.

A major part of the hesitation on the OBBB when it came back to the House 48 hours later was due to Murkowski’s inserted change.  A few days later, President Trump thankfully issued an executive order to address abuse specific to wind and solar projects. 

This administration is moving the ball forward in alignment with most Americans who are tired of watching their tax dollars subsidize projects that should stand on their own.

'1940854197106217267',"Official Statement from Congressman Josh Brecheen 

After a long night working with the White House and leadership, I voted yes to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill after I was convinced our efforts would result in the best possible outcome.

We had major concerns going into this week after the Senate reversed several conservative provisions we fought for in the House version of the bill, including major deficit and spending cuts and priorities like ending the Green New Scam. 

Some of these changes were created by the parliamentarian, others were not. These changes were of grave concern to me. 

While today’s bill is not perfect, after days of prayerful consideration and examination of the facts, I ultimately came to the conclusion it was the best bill we could politically achieve after meeting with the President, the Vice President, and their team. The explanation of the problem of going back to the Senate for further changes—and how that would have only made the bill worse because the liberals of the conference would extract more liberal concessions, not conservative concessions—resonated with me.  

The @freedomcaucus fought to make this bill better at every stage—and we succeeded. We secured transformational wins for fiscal responsibility, border security, energy independence, welfare reform, and tax relief. We secured significant commitments on continuing to move the ball forward on the American First agenda, and thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the work to dismantle the swamp’s agenda isn’t finished—it’s just getting started.",en,Tweet,5,168,24,88,7866,2025-07-03 20:24:34,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gu9Mmd9WUAA-F58.jpg

Although the Lord has given you bread of privation and water of oppression, He, your Teacher will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will behold your Teacher.

Then he came there to a cave and lodged there; and behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and He said to him, ""What are you doing here, Elijah?""

He said, ""I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.""

So He said, ""Go forth and stand on the mountain before the Lord."" And behold, the Lord was passing by! And a great and strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.
After the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of a gentle blowing.

'1933626588333289647',"Yesterday, we voted to pass the first White House rescissions package: a necessary (first step) action to defend American taxpayers from decades of unconstitutional and irresponsible government spending allowed by both parties in Washington. 

While this package does not address every area of government spending, it cuts $9.4 billion in wasteful, woke, and weaponized programs that have long burdened Americans. 

For example, the package claws back $8.3 billion from USAID for line items like $9.3 million to teach Russian doctors to perform abortions, $1 million to Haiti for voter ID, and $833,000 to support “transgender sex workers” in Nepal. It also targets funding for programs that have served as vehicles for leftist agendas at the taxpayer’s expense, including NPR and PBS.

These shameful priorities do not serve the American people. Taxpayer money should never subsidize ideology, whether at home or abroad. We must continue to redirect all government funding to core national interests, not insidious globalist projects. 

When I ran for office, it was on the platform to get us back to Constitutional adherence, including the fiscal realm. The cuts in today’s rescissions package stem from priorities that were never laid out within the eighteen enumerated powers of the Constitution. Such expenditures are an abusive overreach of government power and force a bloated bureaucracy into American lives. This is not the role the Founders intended the government to play and passing these cuts begins to restore that truth.

'1925739025450614902',"(3/4) The final bill obtains a true repeal of Green New Scam wind and solar subsidies for new projects starting 60 days after the bill is signed into law. It moves Medicaid work requirements up to 2026, restoring the dignity of work in America. And it prohibits taxpayer funds via Medicaid paying for transgender surgeries for adults. 

And again, the math works now—in keeping with our Budget Committee’s blueprint regarding CBO scores on savings in tandem with growth expectations as tied to President Trump’s first term. These important revisions clarified my decision to finally support the bill and were in line with what I know is truthful, of both my convictions and yours. I was able to have upright intentions after close examination. 

In addition to all these other things we’ve worked on, some additional victories in the bill include:

• Preventing a 24% tax hike on the average eastern Oklahoman; 
• Investing a historic $81 billion in Border Security to build the wall, increase the number of border patrol agents, and acquire technologies to prevent the flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl into our country; 
• Including the REINS Act, which prevents bureaucrats from issuing costly rules that will increase inflation and harm our economy (which I had the honor of adding to the bill in the Budget Committee); 
• Removing suppressors from the National Firearm Registry, restoring the right of law-abiding Americans to bear arms; 
• Providing tax relief for our great seniors; 
• Implementing a tax on remittances to ensure money earned in the United States goes to supporting American businesses and communities; 
• Expediting permitting to promote American energy dominance; 
• Requiring an accelerated audit of the Department of Defense 

In my discussions with the Budget Committee, their score—based upon the work of @chiproytx, @RepRalphNorman, @Rep_Clyde, and myself to negotiate these changes—would save between $100-130 billion dollars in savings over the next 10 years. Additionally, we also legitimized the previous savings that the CBO had scored relative to ending the Green New Scam, whereas before it was calculated on what was never going to happen, based on history. 

The final product is not complete as this bill now heads to the Senate. My hope is that all the good we did will hold solid moving forward. I stayed prayerful throughout this entire process, analyzing motives and truth. 

I want to thank President @realDonaldTrump and his team and @SpeakerJohnson for giving us the runway to strengthen conservative commitments in the One Big Beautiful Bill. And I am even more grateful for your trust as I continue to represent your values and, to the best of my ability, uphold the convictions we as Oklahomans hold dear.",en,Reply,1,28,5,3,1485,2025-05-23 03:22:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1925739022636179853',"(2/4) These provisions were a result of liberal ideologies, retained by some in the Republican House of Representatives, who allowed these to remain in the One Big Beautiful Bill prior to it coming to our committee. These ideologies are NOT in line with the mandate President Trump was given by the American people, and he was NOT the one who put them in the bill. 

My colleagues and I worked through the weekend, negotiating with House leadership and the White House to fix these flaws. When the revised framework came up on the evening of Sunday, May 18th, I voted “present”—not to dodge responsibility, but to honor the progress made while signaling that more work was needed. This was the first time I’ve ever voted present, and I did not do so lightly. I wanted to recognize the headway we had made in negotiations with the White House and the Speaker, relative to wind and solar tax credit reform and work requirements.

I believe in the Scripture in Matthew 5:37 which says, “Let your yes be yes, and your no be no.” In this situation, I couldn’t be a “yes,” because there were still things that had to be negotiated relative to the math working out, like SALT from the New Yorkers’ request and a hanging CBO score on the unintended consequences of Medicaid expansion.

I didn’t want to vote “no,” either, because it would kill the bill. So the four of us voted “present,” knowing it would allow the bill to move forward, with Leadership fully knowing we would continue negotiations so that I could get to a “yes” vote on the floor. This was fully explained to Leadership and the White House and we all agreed to do this before the present vote was cast.

After days of working with President Trump and the White House team, Speaker Mike Johnson, and other members of House Leadership, we made significant steps to move this legislation more in line with President Trump’s agenda so that we have the tools we need to keep his promises to the American people. 

On Monday afternoon, May 19th, I learned that transgender surgeries for adults as paid for by Medicaid was another problem that needed to be addressed in the bill. I brought this up to the Speaker Monday evening, and based on his response, it was the first he had heard of it remaining a part of the bill. I then began working with him to remove this, letting him know it was an issue for me when it went to the floor. 

Over the next couple of days, between discussions with the White House and the Speaker, we got all of this ironed out. The numbers worked out—in keeping with our budget blueprint to ensure deficit neutrality, so that we could operate in truth—and I got to a “YES.” (cont.)",en,Reply,0,5,1,1,219,2025-05-23 03:22:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1925739019343695877',"✍🏼🧵(1/4) Why I Voted Yes on the One Big Beautiful Bill 

Writing to Henry Knox in 1795 as he faced the intense national debate over the Jay Treaty, George Washington described his lack of perfect wisdom: “I have found no better guide hitherto than upright intentions, and close investigation.” Not claiming to be an infallible man, Washington relied upon his honest convictions and a close examination of the facts to guide him through difficult decisions. 

The cornerstone of upright intentions is truth.

Oklahomans rightly expect their representatives to embody upright intentions, be guided by the truth, and diligently represent them. That’s why, after a week of tough negotiations, I changed my vote on the One Big Beautiful Bill—in good conscience first voting “no” in committee, then “present” in committee to allow it to pass, and finally a “yes” on the floor after the bill was improved. I want you to know why.

When the bill first came before the House Budget Committee on May 16th, I closely examined the text as drafted by other House members, and found it didn’t deliver on several key conservative promises in keeping with President Trump’s commitments on ending the Green New Scam and meeting our Budget Committee blueprint for fiscal discipline.

After consulting @AlexEpstein—author of the book Fossil Future—and other energy experts, it was apparent that the bill failed to do a true repeal of the Green New Scam’s wind and solar tax credits. Instead of terminating these subsidies this Congress, the bill relied on future Congresses to adhere to “phaseouts” starting in 2029. The promise to start phasing out wind and solar subsidies after President Trump’s term ended was a recipe for lobbyists to circumnavigate him.   

Energy security is national security, and my conservative colleagues and I were deeply concerned that the bill did not provide a pathway to end solar and wind subsidies that prop up Chinese industries at the expense of Oklahoma’s oil and gas jobs. Oklahoma is America’s 5th largest natural gas producer, and our nation’s economy depends on energy independence—not reliance on China. Currently, China dominates the global solar supply chain and is subsidized by American dollars, as solar accounts for 61% of all new electricity generated in the United States in the last few years.

Even worse, if these subsidies are allowed to continue, we risk our electric grid becoming entirely dependent on subsidized, unreliable energy that is linked to communist China—making our grid vulnerable to CCP attacks. As reported nationally this week, Chinese tech is being found embedded in solar components connected to our grid. 

Since 1999, there have been at least ten times that Congress has promised to end the type of tax subsidies that wind and solar now enjoy, yet each time, they’ve kicked the can down the road (see below chart). In order to ensure these tax credits end, it was vital that the timeline be kept within President Trump’s term—where he would ensure the Green New Scam would end and not let lobbyists overpower Republican promises to do so. 

As Patrick Henry said, ""I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience.” Experience would tell us—as history often repeats itself—that Congress will delay on this promise yet again without President Trump to hold them accountable. I could not advance a bill that enabled this in good conscience. 

I was also gravely concerned by the lack of meaningful Medicaid reform in the bill. The old bill delayed work requirements for able-bodied citizens until 2029—a timeline that did a disservice to millions of hardworking Americans. Our no vote in committee was to address the things we knew did not align with conservative principles.

'1925723173229588613',"(2/4) These provisions were a result of liberal ideologies, retained by some in the Republican House of Representatives, who allowed these to remain in the One Big Beautiful Bill prior to it coming to our committee. These ideologies are NOT in line with the mandate President Trump was given by the American people, and he was NOT the one who put them in the bill. 

My colleagues and I worked through the weekend, negotiating with House leadership and the White House to fix these flaws. When the revised framework came up on the evening of Sunday, May 18th, I voted “present”—not to dodge responsibility, but to honor the progress made while signaling that more work was needed. This was the first time I’ve ever voted present, and I did not do so lightly. I wanted to recognize the headway we had made in negotiations with the White House and the Speaker, relative to wind and solar tax credit reform and work requirements.

I believe in the Scripture in Matthew 5:37 which says, “Let your yes be yes, and your no be no.” In this situation, I couldn’t be a “yes,” because there were still things that had to be negotiated relative to the math working out, like SALT from the New Yorkers’ request and a hanging CBO score on the unintended consequences of Medicaid expansion.

I didn’t want to vote “no,” either, because it would kill the bill. So the four of us voted “present,” knowing it would allow the bill to move forward, with Leadership fully knowing we would continue negotiations so that I could get to a “yes” vote on the floor. This was fully explained to Leadership and the White House and we all agreed to do this before the present vote was cast.

After days of working with President Trump and the White House team, Speaker Mike Johnson, and other members of House Leadership, we made significant steps to move this legislation more in line with President Trump’s agenda so that we have the tools we need to keep his promises to the American people. 

On Monday afternoon, May 19th, I learned that transgender surgeries for adults as paid for by Medicaid was another problem that needed to be addressed in the bill. I brought this up to the Speaker Monday evening, and based on his response, it was the first he had heard of it remaining a part of the bill. I then began working with him to remove this, letting him know it was an issue for me when it went to the floor. 

Over the next couple of days, between discussions with the White House and the Speaker, we got all of this ironed out. The numbers worked out—in keeping with our budget blueprint to ensure deficit neutrality, so that we could operate in truth—and I got to a “YES.” (cont.)",en,Reply,0,3,0,0,96,2025-05-23 02:19:17,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

I am grateful to @realDonaldTrump and his team, @SpeakerJohnson, @GOPMajorityWhip Tom Emmer, and other members of leadership, for ensuring that we obtained a true repeal of the Green New Scam’s wind and solar tax credits and that transgender surgeries will no longer be paid for at the taxpayer’s expense.

Not only that, but the math WORKS now in keeping with our Budget Committee’s blueprint (regarding CBO scores on savings in tandem with growth expectations as tied to President Trump’s first term). 

In addition to the victories we obtained these last few days, the One Big Beautiful Bill:

✅Prevents a 24% tax hike on the average eastern Oklahoman

✅Invests a historic $81 billion in Border Security to build the wall, increase the number of border patrol agents, and acquire technologies to prevent the flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl into our country 

✅Includes the REINS Act, which prevents bureaucrats from issuing costly rules that will increase inflation and harm our economy (shoutout to @Kat_Cammack for allowing us to assist her on this)

✅Removes suppressors from the National Firearm Registry, restoring the right of law-abiding Americans to bear arms

✅Provides tax relief for our great seniors

✅ Implements a tax on remittances to ensure money earned in the U.S. stays to help support American businesses and communities 

✅Expedites permitting to help promote American energy dominance

I’m grateful to President Trump and his team for giving us the runway to strengthen his commitment to ending the Green New Scam—especially when it comes to wind and solar subsidies.

Speaker Johnson, Leader Scalise, Chairman Arrington, Chairman Smith, and their teams worked around the clock with us this weekend to address our concerns.

'1924216512862449927',"From @WSJ: “Roy and other Republicans say the current plan misses a rare chance to alter the nation’s red-ink trajectory by reducing spending on growing social safety-net programs. They want Medicaid work requirements to start sooner than 2029, as the current bill does. The spending hawks also want faster removal of clean-energy tax credits, which the current bill phases out over several years. They warn that the bill, as written, front-loads tax cuts in the next few years and delays spending cuts. That combination, they argue, means that budget deficits could be significantly higher in the short run.”

“Brecheen is particularly focused on the clean-energy tax credits and wants them eliminated as soon as possible. He opposes the provision in the bill that keeps some partial credits in place for projects placed in service as late as 2031 and warned that lobbyists would push a future Congress to keep wind and solar tax breaks alive.”

We must address the solar and wind tax credits now. If they are allowed to linger, we risk our electric grid becoming entirely dependent on subsidized, unreliable energy. China manufactures most of the solar components we continue to use, meaning we are subsidizing Chinese industry. This threatens American jobs and displaces reliable natural gas.

'1923792964569940456',"We’re working through the weekend to get our “One Big Beautiful Bill” on track.

Congress has to stop repeating history—we know that keeping wind and solar credits in this bill will drain taxpayers, offshore American jobs, and prevent American energy dominance. President Trump has been clear: it’s time to end the Green New Scam. That means now, not later. Our “no” vote in committee yesterday was a necessary stand to force this change.

As it is currently drafted, the House’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” keeps many of the Democrats’ Green New Scam tax subsidies in place—like wind and solar credits—for nearly two more decades, until 2041. The so-called “phase out” doesn’t even begin until after President Trump’s term ends.

As this article makes clear, delaying a Green New Scam repeal until 2029—or later—risks locking these subsidies in permanently. Every year they remain, the green lobby gets richer, more established, and harder to defeat.

These subsidies are propping up Chinese industry at the expense of American workers. In 2024, solar accounted for 61% of all new U.S. electric generation—driven by federal handouts. China dominates the global solar supply chain, so we are effectively using American tax dollars to subsidize Chinese manufacturing. Meanwhile, affordable, reliable U.S. natural gas and coal—and the jobs they support—are pushed aside.

Oklahoma is a top-five natural gas exporter. We know firsthand that grid instability, job loss, and dependence on China have no place in a Republican energy bill. We must repeal these subsidies ASAP—not in 2029.

- $6 billion to bolster our military readiness and bring shipbuilding back to the United States

- No funding for earmarks, which taxpayers spent over $14 billion on last year
