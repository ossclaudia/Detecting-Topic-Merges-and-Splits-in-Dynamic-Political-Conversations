'1967623323010920755',"Housing costs are squeezing families across the country, from record mortgage payments to rents rising faster than inflation. The Census Bureau’s new data makes clear what so many working families in CA-19 already know: the cost of housing is out of control.
 
We need to take a comprehensive approach to housing affordability, from the bottom up.
 
My Workforce Housing Tax Credit Act would increase the supply of affordable housing for middle-income families who earn too much to qualify for low-income housing and not enough to afford a home near where they work. My First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit Act would provide qualifying first-time homebuyers with a $15,000 tax credit toward the purchase of a new home, providing them with the support that is needed to build wealth and put down roots in our communities. My More Homes on the Market Act would double the capital gains exemption on home sales and allow homeowners looking to downsize to do so without sacrificing their nest eggs. We need to provide real relief for renters through the Rent Relief Act, further expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, and incentivize the use of Project-Based Vouchers.
 
We can and must make affordable housing a priority, and I’ll keep pushing to ensure every family has the chance to put down roots and build a future in our communities.

'1946606677379166491',"I grew up in our Congressional District and have seen firsthand the growing issues with affordability that affect those of us who actually live here. That’s why affordable housing is my number one issue as the proud U.S. Representative for our home.  It’s why I introduced a legislative package as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee to help tackle this crisis from every angle: expanding tax credits to build more workforce housing, helping first-time homebuyers afford a down payment, freeing up existing housing stock, and co-leading the Rent Relief Act to put money back in renters' pockets when housing costs soar.

CA-19 was named the least affordable rental market in the U.S. To afford a modest two-bedroom, you’d need to earn $81.21/hour. That’s five full-time jobs at minimum wage. 

As your Federal Representative, I continue to fight the challenges that we face when it comes to affordability. I don’t just talk about it, I’m actually doing something about it to ensure that the federal government plays its part to ensure that living in CA-19 is more affordable.

'1939008650397331765',"This week’s Supreme Court ruling curtailed the judiciary’s ability to check executive overreach. Courts have used nationwide injunctions to temporarily block federal policies with widespread impact while legal challenges proceed. That tool ensured that when a federal court found a presidential action likely unconstitutional, the harm could be paused across the country, not just in a single state.
 
Now, the Court has limited that power. Instead of stopping a potentially unlawful executive order nationwide, judges can only issue relief in the states or districts that bring the challenge, unless challengers file class action suits. That means the same executive order can be blocked in California but enforced in Texas. This ruling also delays, but doesn’t prevent, the implementation of President Trump’s executive order attempting to reinterpret the 14th Amendment, an amendment that has guaranteed citizenship to those born on U.S. soil since 1868. For now, the Supreme Court has not ruled on the merits of that challenge. The fight continues.

Reports indicate that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is seeking access to an IRS database containing personal tax information on millions of Americans. This is deeply concerning. Taxpayer data should never be politicized or exploited.

We’ve already seen DOGE attempt to gain access to other federal databases, raising serious questions about privacy, security, and potential political misuse. That’s why I’m pushing to pass the Taxpayer Data Protection Act, which would prohibit political appointees from accessing or manipulating taxpayer records.

We only need three of our Republican colleagues to join us in standing up for the privacy of all Americans. Protecting taxpayer data shouldn’t be a partisan issue.
