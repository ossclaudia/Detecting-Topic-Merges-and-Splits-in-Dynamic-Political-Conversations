'1859978040643616830',"My new statement alongside @SenatorWicker & @SenJoniErnst after Hamas terrorist leaders moved to Turkey:

It is disappointing that Turkey has welcomed Hamas leaders with open arms following Qatar’s eviction of these terrorists.

On October 7th, 2023, Hamas murdered 46 Americans and kidnapped 12. Seven U.S. citizens remain hostage in Gaza, even after the brutal execution of Hersh Goldberg-Polin while in captivity.

This is in addition to countless other citizens of NATO allies who were also murdered and kidnapped. It is unbecoming of a NATO member to harbor foreign designated terrorists with allied blood and hostages on its hands, particularly ones who have already been criminally indicted.

We urge Turkey to abide by the U.S.-Turkey bilateral extradition treaty and immediately arrest and transfer over those Hamas leaders who have been indicted in U.S. courts for their heinous crimes.

This is an opportunity to improve Turkish-congressional relations and strengthen the bonds of our friendship.
