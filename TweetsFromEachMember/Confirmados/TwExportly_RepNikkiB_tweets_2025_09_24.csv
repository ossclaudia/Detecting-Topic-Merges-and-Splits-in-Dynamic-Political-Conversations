Political violence has no place in this country. If someone can be attacked for holding views you disagree with, then someone can just as easily be attacked for holding views you share. 

I know how frightening these times are – each and every day members of Congress are faced with dangerous threats to their life, including myself. That’s why we must be united in condemning political violence, no matter our political beliefs.

I want to be clear: I did not agree with Charlie Kirk’s views. Too often, his engagement was neither civil nor respectful, and he supported ideas that are harmful and out of line with the values we should be building toward – especially when it comes to women, the Black community, and the LGBTQ community.

While the details of this “deal” remain murky, any agreement struck between President Trump and Nippon is unenforceable unless steelworkers are at the table. The current collective bargaining agreement requires robust investment to keep Granite City competitive worldwide. Given that the current proposal fails to meet those standards, it simply cannot move forward.

Granite City deserves more than broken promises and publicity stunts. I’m fighting to ensure that at least $500 million of the $14 billion deal is dedicated to upgrading Granite City Works with a modern granulation system and the infrastructure needed for workers to thrive. It's unfathomable that the initial proposal includes billions for new facilities yet leaves behind the steelworkers at Granite City Works – men and women who have honorably served U.S. Steel since 1927.

'1908210408206307507',"Let's talk about tariffs...

For too long, bad trade deals have squeezed the middle class, manufacturing, and damaged our national security. I believe tariffs are an important tool to support American workers, and when used strategically to fight cheap steel from China, tariffs can be critical in protecting our domestic industry.

But what President Donald Trump has done is reckless.

Instead of using a scalpel to strengthen our workforce, the President has imposed universal tariffs on all imports including on our closest trading partners. 

For the farmers in Central and Southern Illinois, this is a direct hit to their livelihoods. Tariffs drive up the cost of imported goods, from machinery to feed, and make it harder to sell crops overseas, putting their operations in jeopardy.

Now, China has retaliated, and the stock market is crashing. While people's savings plummet and they look for reassurance, the President is golfing. It's unacceptable.

Congress has a role to play here. I am ready to work with the President to negotiate stronger trade agreements that prioritize our workers, rather than strain our economy. By heeding advice from members and their districts, we can find a path forward that will LOWER costs for folks, not make it even harder to afford everyday essentials.

It’s time for smarter, effective trade policies that benefit every American.",en,Tweet,1,8,5,4,594,2025-04-04 18:29:48,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
