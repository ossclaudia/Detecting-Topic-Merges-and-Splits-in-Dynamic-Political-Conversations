'1940842389028979156',"Today, I voted strongly against this bill, which is a betrayal of my constituents and the American people. The bill is fundamentally unfair and un-American; and I am furious that it is now law.

This ‘Big Ugly Betrayal’ is a triple–whammy: it makes devastating cuts to healthcare and food programs while driving up costs for everyone; gives massive tax breaks to big corporations and the ultra-rich instead of the middle class; and irresponsibly adds nearly $4 trillion to the national debt.

Families will lose health care. Hospitals will close. Kids will go hungry. Energy prices will go up. All so the wealthiest 0.1% can get even richer.

That’s not why I came to Congress.

I believe that sick kids should have access to affordable, high-quality health care.

I believe that seniors should never fear going hungry.

I believe that every child deserves to drink clean water and breathe clean air, and I believe that we have a duty to fight for our veterans, just like they fought for us.

I believe that these aren’t Democratic or Republican values, but values shared by every freedom-loving American. This bill is an affront to those values.

People will die without health care. Our economy will suffer.

Twenty years ago, in their rush to appear strong and tough, politicians – from both parties – failed to ask the hard questions before starting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, trillions of dollars and countless deaths later, we still haven’t gotten accountability.

America must not make those same mistakes again. 

I am under no illusions about the nature of the Iranian regime and its proxies – they are evil. We must continue to stand strongly with our Israeli allies – including active and robust support for the defense of the state of Israel and its people, as we have for decades.  

But Trump’s actions last night, taken without any case being made to the American people or the Congress, coupled with his speech doubling down on his sole authority to further escalate the conflict, risks repeating history and starting another forever war in the Middle East.
