'1970141266189979758',"I’m pleased to be the Republican member on the first House Congressional Delegation visit to China in 6 years. The US-China economic relationship is critically important and China is the state of Washington’s number one export market. However, the most important part of reestablishing Congressional dialogue with the highest levels of the Chinese government revolves around US national security interests. I appreciate US Ambassador to China David Purdue for inviting us to Beijing and Chinese Premier Li Qiang for the frank and honest conversation about the challenges and opportunities in the US-Chinese Relationship. It is vitally important that China allow increased regular direct communication between its military and the US military, that it take immediate steps to curb the flow of fentanyl into America and that it partner with the US to help bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close and keep Iran from nuclear proliferation.",en,Tweet,3,13,1,17,1536,2025-09-22 16:00:55,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1dZChCWUAAhb9D.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1dZCg4WIAAKKjF.jpg"

'1940775534201282739',"Latest update - the Big Beautiful Morning continues. Under House Rules, the Speaker, the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader are the 3 members who get special “magic minute” privileges to speak as long as they want on a Bill. D Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is currently using his “minute” to speak agains the OBBB and the expectation is that - similar to how Corey Booker got a little notoriety for setting the “filibuster” length of speaking record record in the Senate earlier this year - that Jeffries is attempting to beat the current 8hr House  record by R Kevin McCarthy. If so he’ll be speaking for about 3hrs more. It’s mainly just performative and he’s certainly telling a few fibs about the Bill, but it’s a fun part of the feisty American Congressional governance process in action. (It’s also a little therapeutic for many of the D’s who thought they’d beaten the Bill last night before the “Republican 4th Quarter Comeback”)  As the old saying goes: “The majority gets to decide what passes, the minority gets to decide how long it takes.”
As such, with some time on our hands, rather than watch Hakeem’s performance, I came back to the office to do a little work and may go hit up the House gym to shoot a few hoops while we wait. Also, some fun Washington state Congressional history in this video about the “ugly baby chicken painting” that gets handed down to new members of Congress from our state.

'1937336220377395514',"1. I’ve been involved with the challenges of Middle East for nearly 30 yrs. Donald Trump’s handling of Iran has been a masterclass in Presidential Leadership of historic proportions. Not only has the nuclear threat of a messianic regime been significantly diminished, new opportunities for regional peace have been opened. (I say this even if fighting resumes with assorted splinter factions of the Iranian IRCG). From Sulamani, to the Abraham Accords to the nuke lab strike, President Trump has displayed bold, strategic and region changing leadership. 
2. While I’m cautiously optimistic about the ceasefire due to the severe degradation of Iran’s military and terrorist proxies, the ongoing threat of virulent radical Islamic terrorism from significant elements should not be minimized in the days, months and years ahead. We must maintain vigilance and capability for this threat,
3. The 3 keys to the recent success have been A)Israeli ingenuity, B) American resolve and C) Increased US domestic energy production which has given us increased flexibility in dealing with the region and made us not only wealthier but also safer.
4. Perhaps the biggest impact of the “12 Day War” (if that’s what we are calling it?) may be its potential impact to reduce the chance of war on Taiwan/Korea & China/N. Korea if the correct lessons are learned.

3. Iranian strikes against US forces in the region or by their sleeper assets in the US and Europe should be met with a resounding US military response. 🇺🇸

It was great to return to Baghdad, Iraq, for the first time since 2008. While the country has made much progress since I was there for the Iraq Surge, it still faces significant challenges from both ISIS and Iranian-backed militias. There are still thousands of U.S. military forces in Iraq working to keep us safe from these threats, and I was pleased to visit our special forces and training missions, and to engage in direct talks with senior members of the Iraqi government.

'1908139309909344497',"How to RESTORE public college sports for taxpayers and athletes:
✅End the NCAA & Create a NEW ENTITY under Presidential Appointee
✅ Treat ALL athletes EQUALLY via pooled NIL sharing to reduce transfer “meat market” incentives 
✅ Share TV revenue EQUALLY across ALL schools and ALL sports to INCREASE the number of Olympic sports offered across the country 
✅ Salary cap coaches to end “arms race”
✅ Ban transcontinental conferences to put academics first.
✅ Participation will be VOLUNTARY for those schools wishing to continue to be eligible for federal student financial aid funding
✅ Participation will be VOLUNTARY for those student-athletes wishing to compete at a university which receives federal student financial aid funding.
✅ Participation will be VOLUNTARY for those coaches wishing to work at a university which receives federal student financial aid funding. 

College sports at highly subsidized taxpayer funded universities are a PUBLIC GOOD and should REGULATED as such.

In an increasingly politically polarized country, college sports play an important role in social cohesion. Young athletes need increased opportunities. We don’t need a 2nd NFL, controlled by corporate TV Execs with all of the $ going to football in the SEC & Big Ten. The PUBLIC INTEREST is in MORE SPORTS OPPORTUNITIES for the CHILDREN OF TAXPAYERS.

Congress grants anti-trust exemptions and salary caps to private pro sports in the name of COMPETITIVE BALANCE. It can easily do the same for public universities.
