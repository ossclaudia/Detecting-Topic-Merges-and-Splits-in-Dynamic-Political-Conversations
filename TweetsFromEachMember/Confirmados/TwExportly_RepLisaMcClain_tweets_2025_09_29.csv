'1949886433457586570',"This month, I am honored to recognize Sergeant Richard Loughran as the MI-09 Veteran of the Month. A resident of Lake Orion, Michigan, Sgt. Loughran enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after he graduated from high school at just 17 years old. 

After graduating from basic training as a Private First Class, Sgt. Loughran was recruited to join the Communication Intelligence Group as a Japanese Code Interpreter in the Pacific Theater during World War II. 

Over his three years of service with the Marine Corps from 1943 to 1946, Sgt. Loughran served on the battlefields of Tinian, Saipan, Guam, and Okinawa. He played a critical role in the Wind Talkers Initiative and the radio deception efforts that led to the pivotal American victory at the Battle of Midway.

After retiring from the Marine Corps, Sgt. Loughran earned an engineering degree and founded a successful business, Data Electronics, that expanded across five states. In his civilian life, Sgt. Loughran continued to serve his community. He helped revitalize a makeup studio and became an active volunteer with Toys for Tots and local Marine Corps veterans' groups. 

Today, Sgt. Loughran is not only a community leader and cherished World War II veteran, but he recently celebrated his 100th birthday surrounded by five generations of loved ones. 

It is an honor to represent an exceptional veteran like Sgt. Loughran. His dedication to our nation and community is valiant, and he has truly made Michigan's 9th Congressional District proud.

'1939814276685836335',"This month, I am honored to recognize Staff Sergeant Scott Gatto as the MI-09 Veteran of the Month. A resident of Clay, Michigan, SSgt. Gatto enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after he graduated from high school.

He began his military service with the 3rd Marine Division in Okinawa, Japan, in September 2001, landing in Japan just two hours before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 took place. Over the course of his near decade in the Marine Corps, SSgt. Gatto took part in hundreds of combat missions across the globe, demonstrating his skill, leadership, and loyalty. During the fierce second Battle of Fallujah, SSgt. Gatto was one of only nine Marines in his platoon of 41 to survive. 

Following his retirement from the USMC, SSgt. Gatto played a vital role at the Department of Defense, where he was responsible for providing essential gear to our Armed Forces overseas. In 2013, SSgt. Gatto took the next step in his career, becoming an award-winning sales representative in the pharmaceutical industry. 

In 2017, SSgt. Gatto founded the non-profit organization “Reunite the Fight,"" which is dedicated to supporting veterans through their PTSD struggles. Having been diagnosed with PTSD himself, SSgt. Gatto felt the call to help other veterans access the essential care and treatments. Since its founding, Reunite the Fight has served over 1,500 veterans and continues to be a beacon in the veteran community. 

It is an honor to represent an exceptional veteran like SSgt. Gatto. His dedication to our nation and community is valiant, and he has truly made Michigan's 9th Congressional District proud.

He began his military career at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, where he completed his Basic and Advanced Individual Training as a Fire Support Specialist. His first assignment was at Fort Richardson in Alaska, where he participated in military exercises across Alaska, Thailand, and California. SFC Leidlein was also stationed at Fort Knox in Kentucky and Fort Drum in New York. He deployed to Panama as a Platoon Fire Support Sergeant and served in multiple combat deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

His leadership and bravery were critical throughout his career, as he earned two Bronze Stars, the Meritorious Service Medal, a Presidential Unit Citation, a NATO Medal, multiple Army Achievement Medals, and Army Commendation Medals. He also trained over 15,000 reserve soldiers. 

SFC Leidlein built a legacy of courage, innovation, and selfless leadership. His mentorship of thousands of soldiers and cadets helped shape the future of America’s defense forces.

It is an honor to represent an exceptional veteran like SFC Leidlein. His dedication to our nation and community is valiant. He has truly made Michigan's 9th Congressional District proud.

'1917635910935474330',"This month, I am honored to recognize Senior Airman Robert “Rob” Longo as the MI-09 Veteran of the Month. A resident of Leonard, Michigan, SrA Longo answered the call to serve his country in 1968 when he enlisted in the United States Air Force at the height of the Vietnam War. 

Upon enlisting, SrA Longo was assigned to the Military Airlift Command and was stationed in New Jersey, where he served as a crew chief and aircraft mechanic on the C-141 Starlifter. SrA Longo ensured the operational readiness of military transport aircraft, performing critical maintenance and supporting global aircraft operations. 

SrA Longo would then attend flight school in the nation’s capital and receive additional training at Edwards Air Force Base. Throughout his career, he deployed across four continents and flew to 20 different countries, contributing to the Air Force’s strategic airlift missions.

After retiring in 1972, SrA Longo continued his lifelong commitment to serve, particularly to his fellow veterans. For the past six years, he has served as a chaplain, providing spiritual guidance and emotional support to those who have sacrificed everything for our nation. Currently, he serves as the Chaplain for the non-profit People of Impact at Freedom Lake, as well as at the Lakepoint Church Veterans Ministry.

Beyond his professional and military service, SrA Longo is a devoted family man. He and his wife of 38 years, Cindy, raised triplets and are the proud grandparents of two grandchildren. 

It is an honor to represent an exceptional veteran like SrA Longo. His dedication to our nation and community is valiant. He has truly made Michigan's 9th Congressional District proud.
