'1970554041727098883',"I'll save you all the trouble of reading this weird, meandering, lie-filled rant by Trump.

Essentially, he wants to shut down the down the government because he's afraid to negotiate with Democrats who want to ensure your healthcare costs DON'T go up.

Government funding runs out on September 30. At the same time, the American people are facing a Republican health care crisis that is driving up costs.

The Republican spending bill has already failed in the Senate and didn't even get all the Republicans to vote for it. To keep government open and lower costs, we need bipartisan negotiations right now. 

Instead, Republican's have skipped town, Trump has canceled his meetings, and Speaker Johnson has canceled our voting days next week before the shutdown.

As we celebrate our nation’s 249th birthday today, I am reminded of what led to our great nation’s founding.

The Declaration of Independence was, in addition to an elegant expression of our highest ideals, a list of grievances - a litany of offenses committed by a tyrannical King.

Included among offenses that our Founding Fathers took issue with, were that the King had “made Judges dependent on his Will alone;” had “kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures;” had “affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power;” had “depriv[ed] us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury;” and had “excited domestic insurrections amongst us.”

Our country was founded in opposition to these injustices. In America we have no kings. The character of our country is not contingent on one leader. Despite his abuses and usurpations, the American people remain resilient and resolute. We care for one another, we stand up to bullies, and we fight for justice and equality.

When we were admitted we were put in a holding room in the facility while on-site officials called their superiors to confirm that, by law, they have to give us a tour. While that’s happening, we learn that they are planning to arrest the mayor even though he had already left the premises. So we go back outside to see if this is true, and to speak to the mayor. While we’re speaking to the mayor on the public side of the gate, around 20 armed ICE agents swarm us and shove us and handcuff the mayor, then drag him back inside the gate, which is the scuffle you see on video.
