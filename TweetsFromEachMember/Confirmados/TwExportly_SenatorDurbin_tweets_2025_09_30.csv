'1945927342179647534',"Today’s Committee executive business meeting included 10 nominees—among them Emil Bove, nominated for a lifetime appointment on the federal bench.

Mr. Bove belongs nowhere near the federal bench.

He led the Administration’s effort to strike a corrupt bargain with New York City Mayor Eric Adams and has been trailed by a history of complaints—long predating his affiliation with President Trump—about his temperament, poor judgment, and lack of candor before the court.

Additionally, Erez Reuveni, a career Justice Department attorney who defended the first Trump Administration’s immigration policies, filed a whistleblower complaint with my office regarding Mr. Bove.

That complaint recounted that Mr. Bove suggested DOJ might need to say ""f--- you"" to federal courts that issued orders that the Administration opposed.

I asked Mr. Reuveni whether he could substantiate his claims, and in response, he provided text messages, email exchanges, and other documents corroborating his allegations.

Given Mr. Reuveni’s credible allegations against Mr. Bove, which, if true, clearly disqualify him for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench, I called for the Committee to hear from Mr. Reuveni, under oath, before we voted on Mr. Bove’s nomination.

But Chairman Grassley denied that request.

And today, he cut off debate time on Mr. Bove’s nomination before turning to his vote, as well as nine other nominations, including Ms. Pirro’s.

Chairman Grassley claimed that he was following Committee precedent. This is simply untrue.

When I was Chair, I only limited debate when Republicans invoked Senate rules to shut down Committee meetings, and after Committee members were given ample opportunities to voice their concerns about nominees on the agenda.

Today, Chairman Grassley blocked Democratic members from discussing the controversial records of nominees like Emil Bove and Jeanine Pirro, shut down debate, and forced votes for no apparent reason.

'1938641961264492817',"The Supreme Court just ruled that key provisions guaranteeing coverage of preventive health care are HERE TO STAY.

This is a win for the Affordable Care Act and health care access for millions.

Anti-choice extremists didn’t like a task force’s recommendations that guaranteed access to free preventive services like PrEP, cancer screenings, STI screenings, and other vital services.

So, they tried stealing control of it by challenging its structure.

They failed.

When we passed the Affordable Care Act, Democrats in Congress paved the way for more than 40 million Americans to gain health coverage through newly established Exchanges and the expansion of the Medicaid program—leading to historic declines in the number of Americans without health insurance.

But today, Republicans in Congress are attempting to ram through legislation that would result in tens of millions of Americans losing this health coverage in order to finance tax breaks for billionaires—imperiling rural hospitals and health centers, and ripping away health insurance from seniors, children, people with disabilities, and pregnant women nationwide.
