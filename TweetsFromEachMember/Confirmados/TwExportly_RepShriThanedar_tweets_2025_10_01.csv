Credit card payments cost businesses up to 3.5% in fees, which is then passed on to the consumer. Money orders are a popular way to send money, but can be expensive and hard to access. Stablecoins—digital dollars powered by blockchain—let people send money instantly for pennies, eliminating a hidden tax we all pay.

As a former small business owner, I know how difficult it is to build a small business. Traditional credit card or check payments can take up to 7 days to clear, further exacerbating these difficulties. With blockchain, payments settle in seconds, giving businesses immediate access to funds they can use to grow their business and a greater ability to compete globally—critical when 74% of economic activity is outside the U.S.
