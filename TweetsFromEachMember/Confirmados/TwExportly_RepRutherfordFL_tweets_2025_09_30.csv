'1969053461590229095',"Today, House Republicans passed a clean, short-term continuing resolution to fully fund the core functions of the federal government, so that President Trump and his administration can continue to identify waste, fraud, and abuse of American taxpayer dollars, protect our borders, and support Americans, including our veterans, military families, first responders, and seniors. Most importantly, by passing this stopgap bill, we are ensuring that a costly government shutdown does not fall on the American people.

Contrary to what you may have heard, this is not a huge deficit bill.

They were wrong then, so why would we trust them now?

✅Boost our economy
✅Make President Trump’s tax cuts permanent
✅Focus resources on permanently closing the Southern Border
✅Provide funding to small, rural, and Medicare-dependent hospitals, rural health clinics, community mental health centers, opioid treatment programs, and more
✅Strengthen Medicaid solvency for those who truly need it
✅Incentivize Made-In-America cars and manufacturing
✅End taxes on tips and overtime pay
✅Slash taxes on Social Security, offering historic tax relief to seniors
✅Increase the Child Tax Credit
✅Secure more than a trillion dollars in mandatory savings
✅Cap SALT deductions
✅Modernize America’s Air Traffic Control systems to ensure safe and efficient air travel
✅Unleash American energy dominance

“The release of Amendment 59 by NOAA, without the proposed three-month bottom fishing closure, is a major victory for Florida, especially for our more than 4 million anglers, coastal communities, and families whose livelihoods depend on reliable access to these waters and fisheries.

“This outcome proves what anglers have been saying all along, the proposed bottom closure was a politically motivated attempt by the Biden Administration to shut down access to our fisheries and not rooted in actual data. 

“Thank you to President Trump and Secretary Lutnick for listening to the concerns of anglers across the South Atlantic and pushing for accurate data. The final rule reflects what anglers are seeing and catching, which is more red snapper than ever before.

“I am proud to have introduced the Red Snapper Act in the House and secured funding for the South Atlantic Great Red Snapper Count to ensure we’re using independent, peer-reviewed data in future management decisions. Today is a huge step in the right direction and I look forward to working with the Trump Administration to ensure recreational anglers voices are heard in Washington, D.C.”

Contrary to what you are hearing about the One Big Beautiful Bill, it will NOT be a huge deficit bill. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) was wrong about the original Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) score in 2017. They failed then to account for the tremendous economic growth caused by tax relief for hardworking, middle-class Americans. So, why should we believe them now?

This bill will NOT cut Medicaid and SNAP benefits – it WILL strengthen these programs for future generations.

The Big Beautiful Bill WILL:

✅ Continue to boost our economy
✅ Make President Trump’s tax cuts permanent
✅ Focus resources on permanently closing the Southern Border
✅ Incentivize Made-In-America cars and manufacturing
✅ End taxes on tips and overtime pay
✅ Slash taxes on Social Security, offering historic tax relief to seniors
✅ Increase the Child Tax Credit
✅ Secure more than a trillion dollars in mandatory savings
✅ Cap SALT deductions
✅ Update air traffic control system to ensure Americans fly safely and efficiently
