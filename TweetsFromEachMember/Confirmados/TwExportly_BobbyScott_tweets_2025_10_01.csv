'1940842190436962798',"Once again, Republicans rushed to jam their Big, Ugly Bill through Congress. Their bill will have serious consequences for America’s working families. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that 17 million people will lose their health insurance, including over 322,000 Virginians. It will make college less affordable.  Three million people will lose access to food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). And up to 16 million students could lose access to free school meals. The Republican bill does all of this to fund tax breaks for millionaires, billionaires and corporations. And it makes annual deficits and the national debt worse than they would be if we did nothing.
 
For years, we have heard Congressional Republicans preach about fiscal responsibility and complain about deficits and the national debt. Yet they just voted for a bill that will add an estimated 3.4 trillion dollars to our deficit and that does not even include the cost of interest. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, because every Republican administration since President Nixon has left for their Democratic successors a worse budget deficit than the one they inherited. And every Democratic administration since President Kennedy has left for their Republican successors a better deficit situation than the one they inherited. All without exception.
 
This bill is a collection of policies that will harm America’s working families, bestow tax breaks on the wealthy, and significantly increase the national debt. Every single Democrat in Congress voted against it, while almost every Republican in Congress voted for it while having the audacity to try to call the legislation ""beautiful.""",en,Tweet,0,10,4,3,629,2025-07-03 19:36:51,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
