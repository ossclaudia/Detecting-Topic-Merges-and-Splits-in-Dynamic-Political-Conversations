'1881391806010490954',"Congratulations to our 47th President! I’m so excited to work again with President Trump for the benefit of the American people.

'1879982920821080429',"I am truly honored to be selected to lead the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. I look forward to working with Speaker Johnson and the incoming Trump administration team to advance priorities that are important to Americans.

Since joining the Committee in 2017, I have witnessed firsthand that abuse within our nation’s security apparatus has eroded trust in our institutions and compromised America’s ability to gather intelligence. As Chairman, I will aggressively uphold our mandate to provide credible and robust oversight of the Intelligence Community’s funding and activities. Without aggressive oversight and vigorous protection of Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights, the IC is prone to give in to mission creep and skirt U.S. laws. In all our work, I pledge to preserve Americans’ constitutional rights even as we work to support the IC in doing everything required to collect indispensable information from our foreign adversaries.

This Congress has an opportunity to course-correct from the Biden administration’s failures, promote common-sense peace through strength, and re-focus our nation's intelligence and counterintelligence community against our adversaries. Right now, terrorists, rogue regimes, and foreign state-actors are rapidly developing new ways to exploit and harm America’s national interests, and it’s our responsibility to ensure intelligence agencies remain three steps ahead of our enemies. And now, more than ever, leaks and indiscretions by misguided intelligence staff can endanger Americans and hinder our ability to predict and prevent attacks. Everyone on the Committee and within the IC must be devoted to secrecy regarding the material we review. The lives of our covert agents in the field, and the security of our homeland, depend on it.

The Committee has a unique opportunity to work toward rebuilding our intelligence apparatus so that our IC is focused on the challenges of today and is prepared for the threats of tomorrow. It is our aim to rebuild relationships with our partners in the Western Hemisphere, address issues with the development of IC assessments, determine which intelligence tools are needed to protect Americans, and provide our brave men and women in the U.S. intelligence services with the support they need. In our age of increasing threats from abroad and bloated bureaucracy at home, the Committee will be committed to preventing enemies’ attacks and upholding the privacy rights of all American citizens.

I want to thank Chairman Turner for his work in the 118th Congress. He led our committee ably and admirably, at a time when there was a distinct need for a steady hand. He is a valued member of our Conference, and I will build from the solid base his leadership provided this committee.",en,Tweet,19,272,58,0,85573,2025-01-16 20:03:51,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
'1875281599463616588',"I want to congratulate my good friend and colleague on his re-election as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Mike Johnson is a man of honor and conviction who has shown the American people that true leadership comes from the heart of a servant. The job of Speaker isn’t easy. It requires hard-work, sacrifice, determination, and a collegial spirit ready to do what is best for our country. Mike Johnson exemplifies all those attributes and more. I was proud to cast my vote for him, and I am proud to serve with him in the 119th Congress as we restore America’s economic might and provide our citizens the pathway to a brighter future.",en,Tweet,0,35,4,0,4557,2025-01-03 20:42:29,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Arkansas’s First Congressional District produces more steel than any other district in America. The U.S. Steel-Nippon Steel proposed merger would have been an economic boon to my district and to dozens more around the country with a U.S. Steel presence. While the thousands of steel workers in Mississippi County, Arkansas, will continue producing the highest quality, cleanest steel that the world has come to expect from our top-notch factories, I am saddened that politics got in the way of greater investments today. Our national steel-making industry could have been strengthened by this merger. Instead, we must look to the future and hope U.S. Steel can find a way to renew this partnership with our Japanese allies and continue investing in America. One thing I know for certain: Arkansans are ready to make more steel!",en,Tweet,3,16,2,0,3626,2025-01-03 20:28:31,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,https://apnews.com/article/nippon-steel-japan-cfius-economy-biden-099564a3cddca587af0d7340e0c15ed6,,

'1866928113739055458',"After discussions with some of my colleagues who are well-respected leaders in our Conference, I have decided to forego running for T&I chairman this year. I look forward to playing a leading role, however, in crafting and enacting an America First surface transportation bill by September 2026. This decision is in the best interest of the Conference and will promote unity within our ranks. With a tight majority at the beginning of the 119th Congress, which will shrink even more until three special elections are decided in the spring, I believe it’s in our party’s best interest to have complete unity from Day One.

When I announced in March that I was running for the open Transportation and Infrastructure chairman’s seat, I made it clear that my main goal was to pass a new, long-term surface transportation bill with a reformed financing scheme for the Highway Trust Fund. As a valued leader on this committee, I will continue working to make that goal a reality, while unifying our Conference at the same time. Chairman Graves and I have had a long, fruitful working relationship, and I have no doubt we are on the same page about the needs of our surface transportation programs.

President Trump needs every House Republican on-board and working harmoniously with his incoming administration to make the changes necessary to boost economic growth, dismantle inefficient bureaucracies, and deliver for the American people. I wholeheartedly believe in Speaker Johnson’s vision for our Conference, his dedication to working with the Trump administration, and his wise counsel to each of us. A strong, united, and enthusiastic Republican Conference is what America needs. I look forward to serving my fellow members, the Speaker, and Chairman Graves from my role as a T&I Committee leader.",en,Tweet,2,10,2,0,3514,2024-12-11 19:28:42,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
