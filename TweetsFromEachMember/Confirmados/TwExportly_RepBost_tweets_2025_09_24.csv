This is a direct result of President Donald J. Trump’s focus on bringing American manufacturing back to U.S. soil. His leadership has secured trillions of dollars in new investments, with companies like OpenAI, Oracle, and Apple committing to massive investments in AI and chip manufacturing. Onshoring these industries is a win for American workers, the economy, and our national security.
