'1970526819297435668',"I was deeply saddened by the passing of Judge Oscar Martinez on Saturday, a Laredo native whose decades of service left a lasting mark on our community. From his early years of military service in the United States Air Force to his long tenure on the Webb County Commissioners’ Court as Justice of the Peace, Judge Martinez dedicated himself to public service with integrity and purpose.

Beyond the courtroom, Judge Martinez was a successful entrepreneur and a committed community leader. As President of LULAC Council 12 and through his work with local schools, he championed opportunity, justice, and programs that gave young people the tools to succeed. His efforts strengthened both civic life and educational opportunities across South Texas.

In every sense, Judge Martinez lived out his faith and commitment to others. His legacy of service will continue to inspire future generations in Laredo and beyond. My deepest condolences are with the Martinez family as we celebrate his remarkable life.

At @GCHCTexas in Laredo, providers are doing everything they can to avoid cutting staff or reducing services, but the expiration of the tax credits would move the situation from crisis to catastrophe.

The FBI’s latest data shows cities along the border like Laredo and Rio Grande City continue to have some of the lowest crime rates in the nation. Laredo’s murder rate is just over 2 per 100,000 people, compared to the national rate of 5 per 100,000, while Rio Grande City reported zero murders last year. That is something we can all be proud of.

But safety is more than numbers. It means parents feel secure sending their children to school, workers can go to their jobs with peace of mind, and families can worship knowing their community and law enforcement are looking out for them.

This safety is possible because of the dedication of our officers, community leaders, and families who work together every day. In Congress, I have delivered resources to keep it that way, including nearly $58 million for Webb County through Operation Stonegarden and almost $8 million to hire new police officers in Laredo, along with millions more for community policing and school safety.

I will continue fighting in Washington to make sure our law enforcement officers have the resources they need and our families have the peace of mind they deserve.

While the top 10% will receive $13,600 more annually, the lowest 10% of earners will lose $1,200 every year largely due to cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. These cuts mean fewer people will get the care and food assistance they need, making it harder for working families, seniors, and the most vulnerable to make ends meet.

'1946397111471485207',"Today, I held a press conference alongside Mayor Treviño to update the community on how the Department of Defense is supporting border security here in Laredo.
 
Last week, I toured one of the Stryker units with Mayor Treviño, Customs and Border Protection, and Army leadership to see firsthand how these armored vehicles equipped with thermal imaging and drone detection technology are helping strengthen our border security. These assets provide critical surveillance in the dense brush where illegal crossings often happen, giving Border Patrol real-time intelligence and allowing agents to respond more effectively and safely.
 
I also spoke with Major General Scott Naumann, Commander of Joint Task Force–Southwest Border, to hear directly what our troops need to succeed. The challenges we face are real and growing. Earlier this week, I was briefed on an alarming incident where an Army official was assaulted by an undocumented individual hiding in thick brush. Thankfully no one was injured, but these kinds of threats are increasing. Laredo now ranks among the top cities for cartel-operated drone activity, and the Rio Grande brush accounts for the vast majority of illegal crossings and concealment.
 
The Stryker units are already making an impact. Their cameras can detect movement as small as a mouse from over a mile away, helping Border Patrol focus resources where they are needed and deterring illegal crossings. Clearing overgrown vegetation is also critical to improving visibility and patrol mobility. The Stryker units are prepared to assist with clearing key zones in coordination with the International Boundary and Water Commission and local groups to ensure it’s done responsibly and transparently.
 
These vehicles remain on perimeter routes and use sensors, not weapons, to scan from a distance. They are not patrolling our streets or enforcing immigration law. This is a precision mission focused on deterring cartel drones, disrupting smuggling networks, and ensuring the safety of our frontline officers.
 
In Congress, I am working to fund river-road improvements, expand patrol access routes, remove Carrizo cane, and modernize federal law so Border Patrol and military units have the tools and protections they need.
 
I want to thank Mayor Treviño, Chief Muñoz, @DHSgov , @DeptofDefense , and our local law enforcement for working in lockstep to reducing cartel-drone incursions, illegal crossings, stash houses, and high-speed car chases. This unified effort across all levels of government is delivering results.

'1946011992306913533',"During today’s Appropriations markup, the committee adopted my amendment to the FY26 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill to prohibit civilian drones from airspace within one mile of the southern border.

Cartels are using drones to track Border Patrol and troop movements, enabling the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into the U.S. These systems are growing more advanced and harder to detect, putting border communities and law enforcement at serious risk. Unlike responsible operators, cartels don’t follow regulations — they adapt quickly to evade detection. This amendment helps our agents match that agility by giving them the tools and authority to respond in real time.

Working with @RepCloudTX, we developed bipartisan language that directs @FAANews, @DHSgov, and @CBP to create a no-drone zone along the southern border. It targets illegal activity without disrupting responsible drone use. The amendment also includes clear exceptions for law enforcement, emergency responders, and legal operators like farmers and ranchers.

This sends a clear message: Congress recognizes the threat and expects federal agencies to act swiftly to counter it.

This is a quiet but critical trade deal that keeps grocery prices stable, trade lanes open, and our supply chains moving.

Here in Texas, over 150 businesses and thousands of workers depend on this agreement. Ending it could cost our state up to 32,000 jobs, $4.5 billion in losses, and raise tomato prices by 17 percent. Families would feel that impact directly at the grocery store.

Some have questioned the agreement’s effectiveness, but the facts are clear. Over 99 percent of imported tomatoes meet U.S. standards, with no evidence of widespread dumping. Ending it would hurt not just Mexican exporters but also American distributors, grocers, and workers.

This is an issue with broad support from businesses, trade experts, and community leaders who agree we should strengthen and modernize the agreement rather than abandon it.

The agreement also plays an important role in regional stability by supporting jobs on both sides of the border and easing the economic pressures that drive migration.

I've always worked across the aisle and supported responsible tax cuts, but this bill fails America, Texas, and #TX28. It adds $4 trillion to the national debt, includes the largest transfer of wealth from working families to the super-rich in our history, and makes the largest Medicaid cut ever – threatening coverage for over 55,000 people in our district. It also puts food assistance at risk for the 54,000 people in our district who rely on SNAP.

And it only gets worse at the national level.

The bill kicks 17 million Americans off their health care, slashes $1 trillion from health care programs, and jeopardizes hospitals and nursing homes. Up to 300 rural hospitals and one in four nursing homes are at risk of closing. It cuts SNAP by 20%, undercuts public schools, and burdens student borrowers.

All of this just to give the wealthiest Americans nearly $1 trillion in tax breaks.

Rural hospitals like Starr County Memorial are the backbone of our communities. We must protect the coverage, services, and jobs they provide.

I am grateful to the Hospital Board and team for their leadership, and I will keep fighting in Congress to ensure our communities in South Texas get the care and support they deserve.",en,Tweet,0,2,0,2,509,2025-06-20 06:07:34,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gt3LyMWXwAAydVX.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gt3LyMRWUAEuQhu.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gt3LyMPWIAAk4TM.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gt3LyMSW8AA3zr5.jpg"

'1935068692007764263',"I was pleased today to officially announce the presidential approval of the Colombia Solidarity Bridge expansion—a major victory for Laredo and for the future of trade between the United States and Mexico.

With this latest permit, Laredo becomes the first region on the U.S.-Mexico border to secure five presidential authorizations for international bridges—an unprecedented achievement that reflects years of planning, advocacy, and collaboration across all levels of government. I want to thank @realDonaldTrump, Senators @tedcruz and @JohnCornyn, and our local partners at @cityoflaredo for their critical support in getting this done.

Laredo is now the #9 largest port globally, fueled by booming U.S.-Mexico trade. We hold more presidential bridge permits than any other border region. The World Trade Bridge is the #1 busiest land port in the U.S., and the Colombia Solidarity Bridge ranks as the #3 busiest land port in the southwest. This new expansion only strengthens our position as a global trade leader.

This is a transformational investment in Laredo’s infrastructure and a clear signal that we’re serious about strengthening our role in international commerce. Last year, we processed more than $300 billion in U.S.-Mexico trade through our port. With this expansion, we’re ready to handle even more.

'1934725461407617034',"🚨HISTORIC BRIDGE EXPANSION WIN FOR LAREDO🚨

President @realDonaldTrump has officially approved the Colombia Solidarity Bridge expansion - the latest in a series of major bridge projects unlocking cross-border trade for our region.

This brings the total to five international bridge projects in Laredo that now hold presidential permits. That’s the most ever approved for a single region on the U.S.-Mexico border. These projects include:

✅ The World Trade Bridge expansion.
✅ The Colombia Solidarity Bridge expansion.
✅ The Green Corridors Intelligent Freight Transportation System.
✅ The Laredo 4/5 International Bridge.
✅ The Kansas City Southern International Bridge.

The World Trade Bridge is now the most active land port in the United States. The Colombia Solidarity Bridge ranks as the third busiest in the southwest U.S.

Laredo is already the ninth largest port in the world and this expansion will help us meet rising demand, ease congestion, and supercharge trade.

The Colombia expansion includes new southbound and northbound commercial bridge spans, allowing the existing bridge to handle FAST commercial vehicles and oversized traffic. It will also create dedicated lanes for non-commercial vehicles and buses, streamlining traffic flow and modernizing one of the most critical ports on the U.S.-Mexico border.

This is part of a broader effort to position the Port of Laredo to accommodate the growing volume of U.S.-Mexico trade, which surpassed $300 billion in 2023.

I’d like to extend my special thanks to @SenTedCruz and @JohnCornyn for their partnership and to @realDonaldTrump for delivering this latest permit and helping keep Laredo at the heart of the American economy.

This achievement was driven by federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration, including $7.4 million from the Low or No Emission Bus Program and $4.4 million from the Urbanized Area Formula Grants. With these federal funds and local matching support, El Metro has added 19 brand new compressed natural gas buses to its fleet, significantly expanding access to clean, reliable transportation for our community.

As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I remain committed to fighting for federal dollars to support infrastructure projects that improve quality of life in South Texas.

Relocating would impact 11,900 active-duty troops currently deployed under Title 10 authority - threatening readiness, jobs, and military families.

As of today, San Antonio has invested $20M in new facilities and to improve key military medical missions. It also hosts Air Forces Cyber, which is essential to our nation's cybersecurity.

Let me be clear: I’ll keep working with the Texas delegation to protect our servicemembers, strengthen Texas, and ensure border security.

'1932509111247052899',"At today’s Oversight hearing with @SecDef Pete Hegseth, @thejointstaff Chairman General Dan Caine, and @DeptofDefense Comptroller Bryn MacDonnell, I raised serious concerns about the proposal to consolidate Army North and South and move the command out of San Antonio.

Army North plays a vital role supporting @DHSgov on the southern border with surveillance, logistics, engineering, and medical assistance. Relocating it risks undermining mission effectiveness at a time when 11,900 active-duty troops are deployed under Title 10 authority as part of Joint Task Force–Southern Border.

This decision would impact not just national security, but also our local economy. The military is San Antonio’s top employer, and the community has already invested $20M in new facilities to enhance its role as a hub for military medical missions. San Antonio also hosts the Sixteenth Air Force (Air Forces Cyber), a key component of our nation’s cyber defense. This move would disrupt military families who’ve already relocated to support these critical missions.

San Antonio has the infrastructure, workforce, and strategic location to support our national defense. I’ll continue fighting to keep these vital missions right here - close to the border they’re tasked with protecting.

I look forward to continuing these conversations to ensure our national security decisions strengthen, not weaken, border readiness and Texas communities. I’ll continue working with our San Antonio delegation, and the entire Texas delegation, to keep these missions in place, protect our servicemembers and families, and ensure South Texas remains at the center of our national defense strategy.",en,Tweet,0,3,0,1,497,2025-06-10 19:44:11,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtGmdz3W0AA3_LH.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtGmextWkAE7A71.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtGmfrfX0AAVDnc.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtGmgj2XYAAFDLX.jpg"

'1929607608945824148',"Today I was proud to stand at the @ThePortofCC as an appropriator to celebrate a major milestone for South Texas, the completion of a federal  $625 million dollar channel improvement project. This effort will power our economy, strengthen national security, and expand our global competitiveness.

This is not just infrastructure. It is an investment in opportunity. It shows what is possible when we build smart and work together for a stronger, safer, and more prosperous future.

As one of only three Strategic Military Seaports in Texas, the Port of Corpus Christi is vital to both our economic strength and national defense. With this project complete, the Port is now ready to lead in energy independence and global trade.

Corpus Christi has become the nation’s largest energy export gateway, due in part to my working on legislation with Rep. Joe Barton to lift the U.S. oil export ban in 2015. I have also worked to ensure the federal government not only funds ports like this but truly understands their importance.

This achievement reflects true partnership. Thank you to Congressman Michael Cloud, former Congressman Solomon Ortiz, Brigadier General George H. Walter for your leadership.

Together with the Port of Laredo, Corpus Christi forms a vital trade corridor linking our region to the world!

Together, we recognized the deep toll this epidemic has taken on our families, our neighborhoods, and our way of life. Many lives in Webb County have been lost to fentanyl. Each one was a loved and valued member of our community. But in the face of that pain, Laredo did not stay silent or still. You came together, took action, and chose to fight back.

Thanks to the extraordinary leadership of individuals like Mayor Dr. Victor D. Treviño, Deputy Fire Chief Roberto Gonzalez, Police Chief Miguel A. Rodriguez Jr., and Sheriff Martin Cuellar, along with our educators, health professionals, law enforcement, and countless community partners, overdose deaths in Webb County dropped by 52 percent in just one year. That is real progress and a testament to what is possible when a community works together.

Nearly five million dollars in federal support has helped fund prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts, including expanded Narcan access. But the driving force behind this change is right here in Laredo. It is in the people who refused to lose another life without a fight.

As part of today’s conference, I was proud to present Congressional Certificates of Recognition to several law enforcement agencies and community organizations for their outstanding efforts in combating substance abuse and saving lives.

'1927475216755630409',"This morning in Laredo, I had the privilege of honoring two pillars of our community during a special recognition ceremony. One was for a lifetime of public service and the other for preserving the legacy of our shared history.

First, I recognized Mayor Dr. Victor D. Treviño for his decades of unwavering service to the people of Laredo. From his roots at Nixon High School to his leadership as our City Health Authority during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mayor Treviño has always led with compassion, humility, and purpose. His efforts, including a binational vaccination campaign that administered nearly 300,000 vaccines, saved lives and brought communities together in a time of crisis. Today, I proudly presented him with a Congressional Record entry to honor his lifelong dedication to public health and service.

I also had the honor of recognizing the Order of Granaderos y Damas de Gálvez as they celebrate 50 years of preserving and promoting the vital but often overlooked role Spain played in the American Revolution. From their beginnings in San Antonio to the continued work of the Laredo Chapter, their mission is clear: to ensure that figures like General Bernardo de Gálvez are remembered for their courageous contributions to our nation’s founding. Their efforts earned them a well-deserved entry into the Congressional Record as well.

I’ve supported responsible tax cuts in the past to help working families and small businesses. But that’s not what this bill does. It shifts the burden onto families who are just trying to get ahead while giving the biggest breaks to those who need them the least.

We honor and remember our beloved Bella Blue — affectionately known as Phantom — whose boundless love, gentle spirit, and playful heart touched every corner of our lives.

From the moment she joined our family in 2017, Bella brought a light and joy that can never be replaced. She was more than a pet; she was a faithful companion, a quiet guardian, and a constant source of comfort through every season of life. Whether bounding through the yard or greeting us with that unmistakable sparkle in her blue eyes, Bella showed us the meaning of unconditional love every single day.

It is impossible to sum up all that Bella meant to us. She was there through laughter and tears, through new beginnings and bittersweet goodbyes. Her presence made every ordinary moment something extraordinary. Bella’s spirit was kind, patient, and wise beyond words — always reminding us to find joy in the little things.

Though our hearts are heavy with grief, they are also full of gratitude. We are grateful for the countless memories, the wagging tail, the warm snuggles, and the quiet companionship she so freely gave. Bella Blue’s spirit will forever be a part of our family, living on in every smile she brought to our faces and every soft moment we now hold close.

The U.S. federal workforce has remained stable since 1969 and is smaller than in many other developed countries, making up just 1.87% of the civilian workforce. In contrast, nations like the UK and Canada have larger, more centralized governments.

I’m committed to ensuring our government remains efficient and accountable while safeguarding the core services that federal employees provide to the American people.
