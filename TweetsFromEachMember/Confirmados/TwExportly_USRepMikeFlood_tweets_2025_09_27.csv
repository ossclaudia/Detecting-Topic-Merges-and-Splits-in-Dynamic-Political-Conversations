'1843334307730841657',"On this day, we pause to remember the more than 1,200 people who were killed and the hundreds taken hostage by Hamas one year ago. 

A year later, Israel not only continues to fight back against Hamas, but now faces attacks from Hezbollah and Iran. More than 100 hostages remain in captivity. 

Terrorist groups must never be allowed to carry out another attack like the one the world witnessed on October 7, 2023. 

The United States continues to stand with Israel as they seek to bring home the remaining hostages, root out these sources of terror, and find a return to stability and renewed peace in the region.",en,Tweet,1,7,2,5,1045,2024-10-07 17:55:21,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
