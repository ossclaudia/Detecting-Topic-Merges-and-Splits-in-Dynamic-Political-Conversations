Republicans remain committed to passing crypto legislation, the Defense appropriations bill, and rescissions legislation — but Democrats didn’t take that opportunity seriously in the Rules Committee, and instead resorted to an obscure procedural and political stunt to try and distract the American people from their own failures.

The Rules Committee needed to approve the rule without any amendments, so that is what I recommended. 

Reps. Foxx, Fischbach, Houchin, Langworthy, Scott, Griffith and Jack voted correctly on all amendments in committee so that our House can swiftly pay our brave soldiers and enact the most important cryptocurrency legislation in our country’s history.

'1944363015953866832',"One year ago today, President Trump survived an assassination attempt and terrible tragedy in Butler, PA. Just 64 days later, on his golf course in Florida, the Secret Service stopped another would-be assassin pointing a rifle through the bushes as he awaited the President just 400 yards down the course. 

**Amazingly, this cheerful photo was taken on that same day… less than 5 hours after President Trump survived a SECOND assassination attempt in just two months! 

As fate would have it, Kelly and I had just arrived to meet with him at Mar-a-Lago, right after the Secret Service agents spotted and fired at the suspect, chased after him, and rushed the President back to safety at his residence. We met and talked with him alone there for nearly 3 hours, with Susie Wiles and Hogan Gidley, until the “all clear” was given. 

We will never forget our conversation that day, and the strength and resolve of the man who would soon be reelected Commander-in-Chief. As he processed the event, I told him we were absolutely convinced that God had miraculously spared his life—once again, in view of the entire world—for an obvious purpose. 

It seemed to me then that a new realization had come upon our friend, that he had developed an even deeper sense of his place in his history, the importance of his legacy, and the divinely orchestrated responsibility he was being given. 

Since those jarring events at the end of the 2024 campaign, President Trump has been a changed man. (Two near-death experiences like that would change ANY man!) 

He was already the toughest individual we know, but now he is even more deliberate and contemplative in his approach to our nation’s challenges. He speaks openly about the providence of God, and he understands, as did the Founders of our great nation who had endured so much in the trials and suffering of the American Revolution, the high price of our freedom. As I have summarized so many times in the past year, his head and his heart are in exactly the right place for the times in which he is called again to serve. 

At the very end of our nation’s birth certificate 249 years ago, our forefathers solemnly proclaimed: “And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.” Their extraordinary commitment to America’s cause—even at the risk of their own lives and possessions—was what allowed our country to form and flourish and become the most exceptional of all. 

Thankfully, that same commitment is now carried forward by our 45th & 47th President, who has endured the most unbelievable trials, accepted every risk, and works tirelessly every day to ensure that America is great once again.

At the end of the Old Testament, the prophet Zechariah (Zech. 9:9) had told God's people to expect their righteous and victorious King to enter the city humbly riding on a donkey. This sign would be another confirmation that Jesus was their Savior.

The crowds assembled with great joy that day and lined the street shouting, ""Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord."" (Ps. 118:25-26) As a gesture of joy and respect, many spread their cloaks on the road and others cut branches from the nearby palm trees and placed them on His path.

In Scripture, palm branches are a symbol of victory. (Rev. 7:9)  At the time, the Jewish people wanted a savior to deliver a temporal victory over their Roman oppressors... but Jesus arrived to deliver a much greater victory--over sin and death--for all eternity!

'1908619838915817864',"Today, the Senate passed its version of the budget resolution, and is sending it to the House for consideration. 

Getting the two chambers together will allow us to finally begin the most important phase of this process: drafting the reconciliation bill that will deliver on President Trump’s agenda and our promises to the American people.

There are several key things to remember as we move forward:

The budget resolution is not the law itself, but only the necessary kickoff for reconciliation to begin.

The Senate amendment as passed makes NO CHANGES to the House reconciliation instructions that we passed weeks ago. Although the Senate chose to take a different approach on its instructions, the amended resolution in NO WAY prevents us from achieving our goals in the final reconciliation bill.

We have and will continue to make it clear in all discussions with the Senate and the White House that—in order to secure House passage—the final reconciliation bill must include historic spending reductions while protecting essential programs.

After close consultation with President Trump and Majority Leader Thune, we all agree that the “One Big Beautiful Bill” must be drafted using a collaborative process that results in a single product that can be passed by both chambers and signed into law. We have made it clear the House will NOT accept nor participate in an “us versus them” process resulting in a take-it-or-leave-it proposition from the Senate.

As soon as we pass the final budget resolution, our House and Senate committees will begin preparing together their respective titles of the reconciliation bill to be marked up in the next work period. As always, this will involve input from all Members and will keep us on track to send a bill to the President’s desk by Memorial Day.

That said, all of us have a responsibility to defend and uphold the Constitution and the integrity of this institution, which has stood the test of time for more than two centuries. While I understand the pure motivations of the few Republican proxy vote advocates, I simply cannot support the change they seek.

The procedural vote yesterday was our effort to advance President Trump’s important legislative agenda while disabling a discharge petition that would force proxy voting and open a dangerous Pandora’s box for the institution. To allow proxy voting for one category of Members would open the door for many others, and ultimately result in remote voting that would harm the operation of our deliberative body and diminish the critical role of the legislative branch.

While 96 percent of Republicans voted in our favor, when the procedural vote failed, it was Democrats who stood up and cheered. President Trump’s agenda is now stalled for the week because, beyond the SAVE Act, nothing else can proceed for a vote without passing a new rule first, and many Republicans refuse to do so until we stop the proxy initiative.

Nancy Pelosi experimented with proxy voting during the 117th Congress, and it was quickly abused. Republicans put an end to it then, and we cannot allow it again.

Proxy voting aside, I am actively working on every possible accommodation to make Congressional service simpler for young mothers. As the pro-family party, our aim as Republicans is to support those principles while also defending our constitutional traditions.",en,Tweet,420,17772,3266,6383,959558,2025-04-02 20:48:17,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Republicans have a real opportunity in the next two years to make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government.  Along with advancing President Trump’s America First agenda, I will lead the House Republicans to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, hold the bureaucracy accountable, and move the United States to a more sustainable fiscal trajectory.

1. Create a working group comprised of independent experts – not corrupted by lobbyists and special interests – to work with DOGE and our committees on implementing recommended government and spending reforms to protect the American taxpayer. 

2. Task that working group with reviewing existing audits of federal agencies and entities created by Congress – and issuing a report to my office for public release. 

3. Request House committees undertake aggressive authorizations and appropriations reviews, including providing additional resources where needed, to expose irresponsible or illegal practices and hold agencies/individuals accountable that have weaponized government against the American people.

'1867068167157088360',"My statement on House passage of the FY25 NDAA: 

Today’s passage of the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes important wins for our troops and ensures our military has the necessary resources and support to defend our great nation. Our men and women in uniform should know their first obligation is protecting our nation, not woke ideology. It’s disappointing to see 124 of my Democrat colleagues vote against our brave men and women in uniform over policies that have nothing to do with their intended mission.
 
That is why this year’s NDAA refocuses our military on its core mission of defending America. The legislation supports law enforcement operations and the deployment of the National Guard to the southwest border, expedites innovation and reduces the acquisition timeline for new weaponry, supports our allies, and strengthens our nuclear posture and missile defense programs.
 
Because we believe in peace through strength, we blocked the Biden Administration's plan to reduce the number of US special forces. We remain determined to confront increasingly hostile threats from Communist China, Russia, and Iran, and this legislation provides our military with the tools they need to deter our enemies and keep America safe.
 
We also believe it’s important to refocus the Pentagon on military lethality, not radical woke ideology. This legislation permanently bans transgender treatment for minors, prohibits critical race theory in military academies, ends the DEI bureaucracy, and combats antisemitism.
 
This legislation also reinforces our commitment to America’s brave men and women in uniform, and their families, by making landmark investments in their quality of life. I’m proud that we’re providing significant pay increases to our servicemembers, reducing barriers to employment for military spouses, and improving military housing and access to childcare.

'1852124270836543804',"The trust placed in many of America’s once-great universities has been broken. Today’s thorough report from Chairwoman Foxx and the Education and Workforce Committee shows students why they may want to consider getting a degree elsewhere.
 
Pro-Hamas encampments grew and were allowed to fester on college campuses in the aftermath of the horrific terrorist attack on October 7, 2023. Harvard chose not to stop students from shouting antisemitic phrases; Northwestern’s provost approved of boycotts of Israeli products and put radical anti-Israel faculty in charge of negotiations with pro-Hamas encampments; at Columbia, faculty obstructed plans to discipline antisemitic students who stormed a campus building; and at UCLA, officials stood by idly as illegal, antisemitic encampments endangered and violated the rights of Jewish students. In each instance, these institutions violated the law and their own codes of conduct. Across the board, too many of our ‘elite’ university classrooms have been transformed into training camps for anti-American and anti-Israel activism, subsidized by the taxpayer.
 
I’m thankful for Chairwoman Foxx’s work to expose university leaders’ willingness to coddle antisemites and their abject failure to protect Jewish students.

Justice has once again been served by the brave men and women of the Israeli military. Yahya Sinwar, the vile, disgusting person who orchestrated the October 7th massacre, is dead. Sinwar’s life was the embodiment of evil and marked by hatred for all that is good in the world. His death brings hope for all those who seek to live in freedom, and relief to Israelis he has sought to oppress.

Let this be a reminder to Hamas and all those who were involved in the October 7th attacks: you may try to terrorize and intimidate, but those who live under the banner of freedom will never surrender. The eternal flame of liberty and the faith of the Jewish people will never be snuffed out by the darkness of barbarism and the cruelty of antisemitism.

Still, the death of this man is not the end of Israel’s fight for survival.

'1841218191852179745',"My statement with Leader @SteveScalise, @GOPMajorityWhip, and Chairwoman @RepStefanik after Iran launched a direct attack against Israel: 

Iran is again brazenly attacking Israel with a barrage of rocket fire and an apparent coordinated terrorist attack. The world is watching as Israeli families seek safety and shelter as waves of missile attacks light up the sky. We pray for their safety and urge the Biden-Harris Administration to deliver a strong message to the Iranian regime that this unjustified violence and terror must end. The strategy of appeasement has failed, and a policy of interdiction is not enough.
 
American leadership has never been more important, and the world should know that the United States will continue to stand firmly with Israel as it fights for its very survival. Our adversaries are carrying out increasingly dangerous attacks because of Biden and Harris' weak and failed foreign policy. The world needs America to return to a maximum pressure campaign against Iran, and President Biden needs to make clear that there will be decisive economic and potential military ramifications for these actions.",en,Tweet,12,839,167,561,97885,2024-10-01 21:46:39,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1841083201978015952',"The Biden-Harris economy has made life harder for everyone, and this administration’s failure to encourage a resolution between the International Longshoremen’s Association Union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance will only exacerbate the economic pain wrought by four years of skyrocketing inflation, decreasing wages and fewer jobs. Just one day of paused operations will have devastating consequences on the economy, and hardworking American families will feel the impact of higher prices, empty shelves, and lost economic output.

Solving this problem requires leadership that the Biden-Harris Administration has been incapable of providing.

'1840031748157280620',"My statement with Leader @SteveScalise, @GOPMajorityWhip, and Chairwoman @RepStefanik on the Israeli airstrike that killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah:

Hassan Nasrallah’s reign of bloodshed, oppression, and terror has been brought to an end. A puppet of the Iranian regime, he was one of the most brutal terrorists on the planet, and a coward who hid behind women and children to carry out his attacks. Thanks to the brave men and women of the Israeli military, justice was delivered for Israeli victims of his heinous crimes, their families, and the United States. The world is better off without him.
 
We call on the Biden-Harris Administration to end its counter-productive calls for a cease-fire and its ongoing diplomatic pressure campaign against Israel. Nasrallah’s death is a major step forward for the Middle East, and today’s victory for peace and security should be used to reassert America’s ironclad support for Israel as it fights for its very right to exist.",en,Tweet,110,4058,731,688,418757,2024-09-28 15:12:09,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
