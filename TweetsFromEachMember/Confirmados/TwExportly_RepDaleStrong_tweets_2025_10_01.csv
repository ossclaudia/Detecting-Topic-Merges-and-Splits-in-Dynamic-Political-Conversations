“The Inspector General’s report proves once again that President Trump was right in 2021 – U.S. Space Command Headquarters should be at Redstone Arsenal based on merit and what is best for national security.

The report exposes how the Biden administration bypassed the selection process and recommendations from Air Force and top defense leaders and selected Colorado in an attempt to further President Biden’s political agenda.

The bottom line is this: The Air Force recommended U.S. Space Command Headquarters be built in Huntsville, Alabama. It is past time to go vertical at Redstone Arsenal.
