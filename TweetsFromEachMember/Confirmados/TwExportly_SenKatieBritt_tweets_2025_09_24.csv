'1942617424093724769',"Senator Schumer’s latest Dear Colleague letter is wildly hypocritical.

The true “affront to the bipartisan appropriations process” was him refusing to put a single bipartisan Committee-passed FY25 appropriations bill on the floor last year as Majority Leader…not a SINGLE one. His disastrous decision and failure of leadership is what led to the full-year CR we’re operating under—and the rescissions package Congress is considering and he’s lamenting.

Now, as Minority Leader he’s trying to blow up the bipartisan FY26 process two days before the Senate Appropriations Committee’s first markup.  Moving forward with the bipartisan process is what is allows Congress to fulfill its constitutional role - moving these bills through committee and then across the floor.  Senator Schumer getting his way would be bad both for his own party in the short term and bad for our nation over the long term.

Senate Democrats interested in preserving Congress’ Article I powers and responsibilities should have pushed Schumer to bring our bipartisan products to the floor last year and should now reject this latest effort by Schumer to sabotage our opportunity to get the Senate working again.
