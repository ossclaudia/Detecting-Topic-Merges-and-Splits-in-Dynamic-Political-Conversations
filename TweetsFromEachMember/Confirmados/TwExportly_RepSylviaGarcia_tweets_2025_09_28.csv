🚨 One of the most devastating bills for working people in U.S. history.
🚨 Rips health care away from 17 million Americans — the biggest Medicaid cut EVER.
🚨 Slashes funding for SNAP food assistance — the largest cut in the program’s history
🚨 Hikes costs, kills jobs, and stuffs billionaires’ pockets while exploding the deficit.

We need to kill this bill in the House.

Su pontificado será recordado por su compasión, su claridad moral y su renovada creencia de que todos somos hijos de Dios.

Como el primer papa jesuita, desafió a los ricos y poderosos a reconocer la dignidad en los rostros del migrante, del trabajador, del niño.

Estuvo presente en campos de refugiados en Lampedusa. Caminó por los caminos polvorientos de pueblos olvidados. Llevó luz y alegría a quienes por mucho tiempo vivieron en la sombra.

Más que cualquier Papa anterior, nos instó a cuidar de nuestra casa común, recordándonos que proteger la Tierra no es opcional—es una obligación moral y espiritual.

Cuando el mundo se sentía incierto, él ofrecía estabilidad. Dios nos envió un buen hombre en el Papa Francisco. Un pastor. Un servidor. Un hijo de las Américas que se ganó el cariño del mundo entero.

Yo, al igual que millones de personas en todo el mundo, extrañaré su sabiduría, su gentileza y la fuerza tranquila que llevaba en cada palabra y cada paso.

His papacy will be remembered for its compassion, its moral clarity, and a renewed belief that we are all God’s children.

As the first Jesuit pope, he challenged the wealthy and the powerful to see dignity in the faces of the migrant, the worker, the child. 

He stood in refugee camps in Lampedusa. He walked the dusty roads of forgotten villages. He brought light and joy to those long cast in shadow.

More than any Pope before, he urged us to care for our common home, reminding us that caring for the Earth is not optional—it is a moral and spiritual obligation. 

When the world felt uncertain, he offered steadiness. God sent us a good man in Pope Francis. A shepherd. A servant. A son of the Americas who became beloved across the world.

'1897359760170815647',"I am devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend and colleague, Congressman Sylvester Turner. He was a trailblazer, a dedicated public servant, and a true champion for the people of Houston.

He was a native son of Houston, born and raised in Acres Home, in the same year as the Brown vs. Board of Education decision, to a soft-spoken father and a mother who picked cotton. He never forgot where he came from, which fueled his commitment to change the world. I saw this first hand from the moment I met him in the 1980s and supported him throughout his political career.

For 27 years, my friend was a fixture in the Texas House of Representatives, a man of strong moral character who always led by example. While serving together in the Texas Legislature, I witnessed how he worked relentlessly to deliver for his constituents. As Mayor of Houston, he channeled a fearlessness and grit that allowed him to guide our city through an unprecedented seven federally declared natural disasters, including Hurricane Harvey and the COVID-19 pandemic. He leaves a lasting legacy of uplifting neighborhoods that were often overlooked. We are all better for his work to create a fairer, more equitable Houston.

When he decided to bring his service to Washington, he brought with him the hopes and needs of the historic 18th Congressional District of Texas. He was my partner in good trouble, always ready to fight fiercely for those who needed him the most. My heart is with his family and all who knew and loved him. Houston has lost a giant, but his impact will never fade. If there is one thing he loved more than the City of Houston, it was his daughter Ashley and his grandson Jamison.
