Republicans' ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" isn't about efficiency—it's a $43 BILLION handout to private contractors over 10 years.

Just ONE example: Forcing states to pay Equifax $20 per person to verify employment data for 18 MILLION people EVERY MONTH.

That's $360 million monthly and $4.32 billion yearly.

Experts are calling it what it is: ""Welfare for Deloitte.""

This isn't government efficiency. This is organized graft—creating red tape just to line the pockets of powerful contractors.

We must expose this scheme for what it really is: robbing taxpayers to enrich the well-connected.

'1924356643057226088',"Since the Big Mess of a Budget Bill did not pass on Friday, we members of the Budget committee were called into a meeting to vote at 10p this evening.

Republicans literally rushed to jam through a bill that makes the largest cuts to Medicaid and food assistance in American history—ripping away lifelines that tens of millions of Americans rely on.

And, do not be fooled—the “no” votes from certain Republicans on Friday were because the cuts were not fast or deep enough. In the back room, Republicans agreed to deeper and especially faster cuts to programs. 

My Democratic colleagues and I are still here, though. And, we will still fight to protect care, lower costs, and invest in working families.

'1912098738849325141',"70 MILLION Americans depend on Social Security and one in three households include a Social Security beneficiary, yet the Trump Administration has classified it as a “Ponzi scheme,” with plans to dismantle this critical program that supports the most vulnerable among us. In my district of the Virgin Islands, there are over 20 thousand Social Security recipients, including our elders and children.

Social Security is a sacred trust that represents a return on the contributions that hard-working Americans have made into the system for decades. It is the responsibility of the Congress to continue to safeguard Social Security for all Americans.
