For more than a century, BARC has been a global leader in food safety, human health, and nutrition. Closing it would devastate Maryland, undermine American agriculture, and waste generations of expertise.

I stand firmly with my Maryland Delegation colleagues, local scientists, and community leaders in fighting to keep BARC open. We will not allow political games to dismantle an institution so vital to our farmers, our food supply, and our future.

'1957915048111927444',"As students return to school, working families are feeling the pressure—not just from back-to-classroom costs but from rising household essentials

📚 First-day school supplies will cost an average of 7.3% more this back-to-school season.
🍎 Families will pay nearly $163 more this year for school lunch staples, a 5.4% increase over last year.
These rising costs reflect broader economic stress, not just seasonal expenses. Working families are stretched thin—not just by classroom costs, but by rising everyday expenses like energy bills and food.

Let’s share this message and spark conversation: families shouldn’t have to choose between necessities.

One of our hidden gems is Oxon Cove Park — a peaceful place where you can walk, connect with nature, and even pet the animals. But it's more than just beautiful land. It’s a place with deep, complicated history.

Watch my video below.

Not far from Washington, D.C., this land was once worked by enslaved people. That’s part of our story — and we can't look away from it.

Right now, some are trying to erase uncomfortable truths from our classrooms and communities. But we must tell the full story of our country — the good, the bad, and everything in between — so we can learn, grow, and make sure we never repeat the mistakes of the past.

Our national parks are more than pretty landscapes. They are living classrooms, places of healing, and a reflection of who we are — and who we want to be.

'1939741257649033320',"This deeply concerning New York Times report confirms what I heard on the ground during my visit to El Salvador last month: violent MS-13 gang members are being sent back to El Salvador instead of being prosecuted here in the U.S. The Trump Administration has been rounding up and disappearing migrants with no criminal record to a mega-prison under a secretive private contract, all while letting the real criminals walk free. Congress must demand answers from this Administration. We need real accountability for violent criminals — through arrests and prosecutions, not backroom deals.
