For over a hundred years, it has carried out its mission under Republican and Democratic presidents alike.

Just recently the FTC has saved working Americans money by:

– Eliminating junk fees to stop deceptive pricing
– Combatting monopolization in our food system, preventing even more price-gouging
– Fighting for the “right to repair” products you own from tractors to iPhones

The FTC commissioners Trump tried to illegally fire are currently suing Amazon in two cases, enforcing a twenty year consent decree against X, sitting as judges in matters where FTC staff are trying to strengthen privacy protections for users of Meta, or protect patients from high insulin prices, and working on numerous investigations or lawsuits against companies (like Uber, Coca-Cola, Syngenta, OpenAI, Abbott, and more) that donated millions to Trump. Trump’s attempts at illegally firing Bedoya and Slaughter will slow down that work if not bring it to a screeching halt.
