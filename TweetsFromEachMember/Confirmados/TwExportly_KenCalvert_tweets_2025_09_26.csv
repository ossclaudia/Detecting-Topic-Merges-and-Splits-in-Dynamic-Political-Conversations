Iran was given numerous chances to abandon their nuclear enrichment and weaponization activities but chose to push forward despite warnings from President Trump and Israel.  The Iranian Regime has been the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world; they have armed Hamas and Hezbollah and have repeatedly threatened our shared interests with Israel.  They were the orchestrators of October 7th which saw 1,195 Israelis and 46 Americans murdered, and hundreds taken hostage. From the Beirut bombing in 1983 to the 2024 drone attacks against U.S. assets in Jordan, which resulted in the death of three American troops, they have the blood of hundreds of Americans on their hands. Their day of reckoning has come.

'1925603459237064910',"I promised voters that if they sent me back to Congress, I would fight to keep their taxes low – and that’s exactly what this One Big Beautiful Bill does. The passage of the bill will prevent the looming tax increase that would be the largest in our nation’s history. Job growth, take-home pay, and economic opportunities hit historic highs following the passage of the 2017 tax cuts. This bill extends and expands those pro-worker and pro-family policies.

To support American workers, the bill eliminates federal income taxes on tips and overtime. To support retirees, the bill includes new tax relief for seniors. To support families, the bill increases the state and local taxes (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 as well as extends and expands the child tax credit that Republicans doubled in 2017. To support job creators, the bill expands and makes permanent the small business deduction and allows 100% immediate expensing.

The One Big Beautiful Bill includes resources that will allow the Trump Administration to solidify the tremendous progress made in securing our border by completing the southern Border Wall and investing in our Border Patrol. To secure America and support our military, the bill will allow the Defense Department to acquire ships, aircraft, and other essential weapons systems as well as invest in the innovation entities within the Department focused on deploying vital capabilities in a time frame of relevance.

I have made it clear throughout this process that I would not support cuts to Medicaid for seniors, children, mothers, and the disabled. The One Big Beautiful Bill protects these populations and does NOT cut Medicaid for seniors, children, mothers, and the disabled. The bill makes NO changes to Social Security, Medicare, or veterans’ benefits.

The changes to Medicaid strengthen the program by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse. The bill ensures federal tax dollars are not used to provide Medicaid benefits for illegal immigrants through new immigration status check rules. The bill also implements sensible 20-hour per week work requirements – which can be satisfied through either employment, volunteering, or education – for able adults without children under 65 years of age. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the only individuals estimated to lose Medicaid benefits because of the bill are illegal immigrants, ineligible recipients who will lose coverage due to better enforcement of eligibility rules, and able adults without children who refuse to satisfy the new work requirements. These are reasonable, responsible Medicaid reforms that protect the most vulnerable as well as taxpayers.",en,Tweet,2,20,6,15,1190,2025-05-22 18:23:35,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1852070314064384359',"Earlier this month, @HouseVetAffairs Chairman @RepBost and I held a Veteran Service Organization Roundtable in the 41st District. Here is our joint statement about the many concerns that were raised by veterans and VSO representatives:  

“On October 16, we met with local veterans and Veteran Service Organizations at the Palm Springs Air Museum to address critical issues in veterans' health care. Listening to veterans share their struggles with referral delays and inefficiencies at the Loma Linda VA, and the lack of accountability among senior VA leaders underscored the urgent need for veteran-centered reforms to hold failing leaders accountable. That’s why we’re leading H.R. 2478, the Restore VA Accountability Act, to bring accountability back to VA nationwide, for good.

One key concern raised was the lack of reliable transportation in the region, which forces many veterans to face unnecessary logistical barriers when it comes to receiving essential healthcare. This is unacceptable. We are committed to advancing legislation that holds the entire VA accountable – including Loma Linda VA employees – to ensure that no veteran encounters barriers when receiving the timely, high-quality care they have earned.

Together, we are fighting to create a health care system that prioritizes transparency, accountability, and respect for those who have served our country. Veterans gave their all for this nation, and it is our duty to honor that sacrifice by building a system that meets their needs no matter what.”",en,Tweet,0,11,2,13,861,2024-10-31 19:29:07,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbPf-J-akAI44ME.jpg
