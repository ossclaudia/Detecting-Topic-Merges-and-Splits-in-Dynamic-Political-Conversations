'1966542813270512080',"🚨FULL TEXT: Rep. Roy Requests Formation of Select Committee to Investigate the Left’s Assault on America and the Rule of Law: 

""Speaker Johnson, Chairman Jordan, and Chairman Comer,

I respectfully request that the House of Representatives form a select committee on “The money, influence, and power behind the radical left’s assault on America and the rule of law.” In the wake of numerous attacks on our way of life, the destruction of the rule of law, and the murder of innocent Americans, prominent and unknown alike, we must take every step to follow the money and uncover the force behind the NGOs, donors, media, public officials, and all entities driving this coordinated attack.

The patterns are undeniable: we are witnessing a sustained breakdown of law and order, fueled not by chance, but by anti-American ideology. Of course, we witnessed the 2024 assassination attempt on President Trump as well as the 2017 shooting of Republican lawmakers at baseball practice, but it goes well beyond politicians and to the people themselves.

We have seen targets placed on the Family Research Council and Charlie Kirk by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) only to witness shootings toward each, including the tragic assassination of Charlie just this week, after being placed on the SPLC’s notorious “Hate Map” three months ago. We have seen dangerous networks like Antifa organize, fund, and deploy sophisticated terror campaigns attacking law enforcement and destroying American cities.

We have seen George Soros, the Wren Collective, and other radical organizations funding and putting in place District Attorneys and Judges to then coordinate releasing criminals to the streets. The result has been death and injury to thousands of Americans, including the recent horrifying murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska at the hands of a 14-time released criminal and lesser-known attacks like the shooting of San Antonio security guard and former Marine, Jimmy Friesenhahn, leaving him paralyzed.

However, the coordinated lawlessness and disorder are perhaps most apparent in the forces behind the opening of our borders to release untold numbers of illegal aliens, including dangerous actors who've victimized law-abiding Americans. Laken Riley, whose convicted killer illegally crossed our border and was released into the interior by the Biden administration, was arrested, got released, and then murdered Laken. Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin also fell victim to these coordinated efforts, as their illegal alien assailants took advantage of a deliberately wide-open border, funded by cash given to the U.N.-affiliated and U.S.-taxpayer-funded International Organization for Migration that facilitated the invasion of our borders. There are countless other examples.

Enough is enough. We must follow the money to identify the perpetrators of the coordinated anti-American assaults being carried out against us and take all steps under the law necessary to stop them. The best option is a full, stand-alone committee with complete authority to elevate and investigate these matters. However, I respectfully request that we establish such a committee. It should be comprised of Members and staff with prosecutorial and/or law enforcement backgrounds, and we should grant it full subpoena powers and authority to deliver results.

We can no longer pretend to be bound together by shared ideals when a well-funded, vitriolic cadre of our fellow Americans and foreign interests are at war with the very values of faith in God, fidelity to our Constitution, and respect for the principles of liberty and Western Civilization that define us as Americans – including, notably, the free speech practiced and exemplified by Charlie Kirk.

I am sending this letter for myself and a growing number of colleagues who have been able to respond quickly in support of this call to action, and I will hold this letter open requesting all of my colleagues join with us to say it is time for us to haul all of these actors before Congress and get to the truth behind the coordinated global network funding and fueling this attack on Americans.""",en,Tweet,21,481,159,232,49840,2025-09-12 17:41:57,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

""Today, House Republicans took a significant step forward to provide a market framework to ensure that Americans can innovate with cryptocurrencies. 

I supported H.R. 3633, the CLARITY Act, to allow such innovation without fear of an uncertain regulatory environment.
 
I was most proud to support H.R. 1919, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act – which will guarantee that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC’s) are not permitted in the United States. CBDC’s would represent a radical attack on the privacy of Americans and would allow government and financial institutional unchecked power over our bank accounts, and importantly, our freedom to purchase and move about unimpeded by government surveillance. No government power should be able to limit the ability of a citizen to transact pre-emotive lay based on the policy whims of any particular party in power. The Senate should pass this and send it to the President’s desk immediately.
 
Regrettably, I opposed S. 1582, the GENIUS Act because it was passed without the necessary protections to prevent Central Bank Digital Currencies, and I do not believe we should proceed with building out the necessary structures for stable coin or the development of market structures (CLARITY) without the protection against CBDC.

'1945190181792796685',"Rep. Roy, the Texas delegation, and the rest of the 119th Congress honor the lives lost in the Texas Hill Country Floods for a Moment of Silence on the House floor:

Rep. Roy: ""It was a rough week, lot of destruction, lot of beautiful parts of our state that were destroyed, but we will rebuild. When people talk about destruction, what will not be destroyed is the spirit of the people of Texas and the spirit of the people that those camps represent. 

The spirit of the little girls who are already talking about wanting to go back. The spirit of the people associated with Dick Eastland, the camp director of Camp Mystic who gave his life trying to save those little girls. The spirit of Jane Ragsdale, who lost her life saving five little girls. Her guitar was found down the Guadalupe River just yesterday. The spirit of all of the little girls that were riding in the bus as they left camp, Mystic, singing hymns, expressing their faith as they were looking at the destruction that they couldn't possibly comprehend as they left that camp, but they were still putting their faith in their Lord and their Savior. 

If there's anything that we can take out of this, it's that sense of community and that sense of pride that we have in knowing that we will rebuild and that we will come together, but that sense that we know that the power of the cross that stands on the hills over the City of Kerrville, the power of the faith of the people of Texas, the power of the faith of the people of this nation who have responded...

'1940840957055828412',"🚨Rep. Roy Statement on Passage of The One Big Beautiful Bill Act:

“Today, after a long day-and-night working hard to secure key wins from the administration to end the damaging Green New Scam subsidies, lock in substantial additional reductions in spending, and further assurances on how Medicaid will go to vulnerable Americans and not illegal aliens – I voted to support the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

For the last six months, we worked to guide the reconciliation process in the House to multiple wins in close coordination with President Trump’s team. At each step in the process – passing the budget resolution twice, passing the reconciliation package twice, and working in the Rules and Budget committees – the House Freedom Caucus worked with the President to force Congress to deliver substantial victories.

When we started this process:
• We were told “We can save maybe $300 billion.” House conservatives secured $1.6 trillion in legitimate savings.

• We were told “We cannot touch Medicaid.” House conservatives secured over $1 trillion in Medicaid and Obamacare reforms, established work requirements, and nearly returned Medicaid to pre-Biden spending levels.

• We were told “We cannot touch SNAP/Food Stamps.” House conservatives secured over $100 billion in savings, ensuring it goes to citizens over illegal aliens.

• We were told “We should temper expectations on repealing the Green New Scam.” House conservatives secured the termination of 90% of future ""Green New Scam"" projects, solidified by assurances from the President last night, saving over $500 billion.

• We were told “We cannot do anything for Health Savings Accounts.” House conservatives secured their use for Direct Primary Care, making them much more effective for hard-working Americans seeking choice in a broken healthcare system.

The swamp – in Congress and on K Street – tried to stop the President and those of us fighting to deliver substantial spending reductions and reforms at each and every step of the way. We won fights they said we could not win. 

We added significant resources to secure the border. We have extended tax relief for millions of Americans. We have passed the largest “mandatory” spending reduction in American history. We have terminated about half of Joe Biden’s signature accomplishment, the “Green New Scam.”

Celebrate today. Fight again tomorrow.”",en,Tweet,108,3904,771,613,132583,2025-07-03 19:31:57,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

The fact is, you take some of that money, the state money, they'll [states] go spend it on illegal aliens. They won't use the federal money, which they're prohibited from doing, but they'll use their state money, but they'll still claim all of the provider tax dollars and the FMAP matching dollars and use that to fatten their coffers. 

So they end run the restrictions in the House bill, we said you're going to lose your federal match if you continue to provide Medicaid to illegal aliens. The Senate stripped that out. They hid behind the parliamentarian, but they didn't fight hard enough to keep it in and they didn't rework the language so that we can guarantee that those federal dollars don't flow to states that give money to illegal aliens.""",en,Tweet,9,259,105,69,12853,2025-07-02 17:02:01,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1940438845784227840/vid/avc1/1280x720/mBnHA-LYo-leneWd.mp4?tag=21

'1925590131446046776',"🚨Rep. Roy Statement on House Passage of The One Big Beautiful Bill Act:

""After much deliberation, I voted yes on H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
 
Months ago, I worked to ensure that any tax cuts or extensions would be connected to an equal or greater amount of spending cuts to force fiscal discipline. The good news is that the bill technically held true to that framework by yielding modest deficit reduction over a 10-year budget window.  Importantly, it does this by cutting spending $1.5 trillion over 10 years, reforming programs like Medicaid and SNAP with work requirements, and improving healthcare freedom by expanding health savings accounts to allow use with Direct Primary Care.
 
But the good things didn’t just happen by accident. 
 
My fellow budget hawk colleagues and I, including many in the House Freedom Caucus, forced reforms that were critical to making the bill more responsible. We:

 - Accelerated Medicaid work requirements 3 years from 2029 to 2026.

- Helped stave off further Obamacare expansion by aligning State Directed Payments (SDPs) in Medicaid to the rates of Medicare in Medicaid expansion states while allowing states that have not expanded Medicaid (ex., TX) to have SDPs at 110% of Medicare.

- Froze the state provider taxes to ensure states don’t grow their money laundering schemes.

- Paid Texas and other states back for their border efforts under the Biden administration.

- Began to claw back the “Green New Scam” put on steroids by the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) corrupt subsidies – namely by putting in place a required construction start within 60 days of enactment and a much earlier “in service” requirement of 12/31/28 – all designed to limit the reach of subsidies.

To be clear, I didn’t vote for the bill without significant reservations. 
 
For example, in classic Washington fashion, the bill produces sizable deficits in the first 5 years while achieving “savings” in the future, which means we’ve got to bring forward more savings than I already fought for.
 
And as with most major bills in Washington, this bill was rushed, mashed together, and crammed through the House without sufficient time to review every item carefully. We should do better.
 
The Medicaid money laundering scam was not reformed sufficiently, and far too many of the new green scam subsidies continue to operate.
 
And inexplicably, we funded high-tax state jurisdictions with a $350 billion tax deduction for their “SALT” tax deductions – something I strongly oppose.
 
But even though I supported this bill out of the House, this bill needs massive improvements if we are to make a dent in our deficit or to change the trajectory of this country.  
 
We must reduce deficits much further, even as we continue to work to FULLY repeal the IRA’s unreliable energy subsidies and reduce the damage done by Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.  We can do this most efficiently with state block grants – but we can also reduce the 90% FMAP for able bodied people – ensuring states are not getting seven times more money for able bodied adults with no children over the most vulnerable in traditional Medicaid – and reducing provider taxes to end the unnecessary inflation of costs in healthcare.  
 
I stand ready to work with my colleagues in the Senate to continue to get this bill right before sending it to the President’s desk.""",en,Tweet,69,1689,301,893,86118,2025-05-22 17:30:37,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

We got pretty firm commitments yesterday from the White House in the form of legislative language to help the non-expansion states under Obamacare get some additional support to try to prevent the pressure on Texas and Tennessee and Florida to expand. I think that's bad for the country. So we got 110% plus up on the state directed payments, which is important. 

We also got some commitments out of the White House to make some other changes that they might be taking some actions on at the executive level that we'll see, I think, in the coming weeks.  

We were importantly able to make sure the Inflation Reduction Act had stringent requirements on construction. So within 60 days of enactment, if you're not constructing, you're not going to get subsidies and at the back end on in service. What that means is, in short speak, it tightens down the number of subsidies that could possibly go to any more of these plussed up wind and solar projects, which are making the grid less reliable. 

So those are all really big, important wins for us.""",en,Tweet,16,754,126,167,39319,2025-05-22 16:12:42,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1925570177862615041/vid/avc1/1280x720/NwdvZ-2mgVbPEX7e.mp4?tag=21

Roy asked then-FBI Director Christopher Wray in July 2023 why FBI Agent Brian Auten was able to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop investigation and participate in the Mar-a-Lago investigation despite being under ""disciplinary review"" for deceiving FISA courts with the Steele Dossier to spy on the Trump campaign. 

Rep. Roy: ""The FBI conducted an internal investigation of Brian Auten and then sought to suspend him but Auten appealed. 

Nevertheless, in 2020, after Senators Grassley and Johnson highlighted evidence of potential financial crimes and corruption against the Biden family, the FBI assigned Auten to compile an assessment, which was used to characterize the Biden revelations as Russian disinformation.  

The evidence Grassley and Johnson had collected was mostly financial records and could easily have been corroborated as authentic. 

And by then, the FBI had the Hunter laptop in its possession for over a year, so it knew the lucrative payments to the Bidens from corrupt anti-American regimes were authentic. 

How on earth did the FBI empower an agent under investigation for potentially corrupt performance and abuse of FISA in one politically fraught investigation, a Democrat operative-driven case against President Trump, to play a key role to undermine a second politically fraught investigation, a case against the Bidens?

'1910376175450411382',"🚨 REP. ROY STATEMENT ON THE PASSAGE OF THE BUDGET RESOLUTION🚨

""Today, I reluctantly voted for the Senate amendment to the House Budget Resolution on the basis of three specific commitments that form the floor for my consideration of the final reconciliation package.

First, the President committed to a minimum of $1 trillion in real reductions in mandatory spending, efforts to fully repeal the damaging “green scam” subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and Medicaid reforms addressing eligibility, waste, fraud, abuse, and the disastrous money laundering schemes pervasive in the program.

Second, the Speaker of the House made a specific commitment to guarantee the House framework tying tax cuts to spending cuts. This was a non-negotiable deal-breaker  – and will be for the final product.  In keeping with the House budget resolution, the commitment would mean we start with a base assumption of $2.5 Trillion in economic growth and then $1 for $1 tax cuts to spending cuts above that number – such that when we achieve $1.4 Trillion in cuts, we will achieve the number necessary for TCJA permanence.

Third, and finally, the Senate Majority Leader committed to achieving the House minimum of $1.5 Trillion in spending cuts. This comes on top of budget topline numbers that, while aspirational, represent a significant statement of commitment by the Senate to drive down spending.

I would have preferred we amended the Senate bill to reflect these commitments. But, in the interest of comity, I will take them at their word. But, to be clear, failure to achieve these baselines including deficit neutrality will make it impossible for me to support a final reconciliation product.

This is the opportunity for Congress to simply make a down payment on our $36 trillion national debt. It is on all Republicans to ensure that the crippling tax of inflation does not put car and home ownership further out of reach for the American family. It is time for House and Senate committees to get to work to save our Republic from financial ruin. Failure is not an option. I look forward to working with Majority Leader Thune, Speaker Johnson, and the President to deliver for the American people.”",en,Tweet,0,66,4,23,3249,2025-04-10 17:55:47,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

“The Biden Administration’s open-border policies, led by impeached former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, brought a historic number of criminal aliens and dangerous actors into our communities.  Texans – including those in TX21 – have suffered as a direct result, from dozens of fentanyl related deaths to human trafficking, and now an enormous gang operation. The Venezuela-based prison gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) - among the worst groups that have infiltrated the nation - was operating right in the heart of suburban Austin in Hays County, Texas, where I call home.

I commend the Hays County Sheriff's Office, the San Antonio Police Department (SAPD), the Texas Department of Public Safety (TDPS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for apprehending these foreign gang members from our streets. The people of Texas' 21 Congressional district – and the nation – are safer thanks to the teamwork of these agencies.

While South American gangs engage in murder, extortion, human trafficking, and terrorism - activist judges and radical progressive Democrats continue to impede the President and Republican leaders from removing these criminals from the United States.  There should be unanimity of purpose among all our nation’s leaders to bolster enforcement efforts against all illegal aliens, criminal gangs, and cartels until every last member is incarcerated and deported.  I look forward to working with my colleagues and members of law enforcement to ensure this happens, as well as working to codify the Trump Administration’s efforts to label these evil actors as the rightful terrorists they are – legislation I first introduced in in 2019.”",en,Tweet,4,116,34,7,13632,2025-04-03 21:05:42,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

""Today, I voted to effectively freeze spending levels for six more months and to give runway for the Trump Administration to continue its efforts to root out wasteful spending. House Republicans and President Trump are moving quickly to clean up the mess left by Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden, who refused to pass a budget or any appropriations bills – despite the House GOP passing five off the floor, and all 12 out of committee.

Notably, this “continuing resolution” excludes earmarks, modestly reduces year-over-year spending, and most importantly, prevents Democrats from purposefully shutting down DOGE, President Trump, and Russ Vought from uncovering the billions in waste, fraud, and abuse that has been going on for decades.  The American people are now seeing that this whole town – THE SWAMP – has been wasting their money on absurd expenditures.

But this is just one more step, of many, in the spending fight.  

Now, our focus must be on supporting the President’s efforts to impound and rescind unnecessary spending, passing appropriations bills for FY26 at a low topline including many of the DOGE-identified cuts, and then finalizing a conservative reconciliation package. We must cut the massive inflation tax resulting from rampant spending by working to deliver on spending reductions ABOVE the $2 trillion FLOOR the House passed in our budget along with making tax cuts permanent.

'1896648163295219749',"🚨 REP. ROY STATEMENT ON INAUGURAL NON-STOP FLIGHT FROM SAN ANTONIO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SAT) TO RONALD REAGAN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT (DCA) 🚨

“Throughout my time in Congress, I have been working side-by-side with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a solution to enable a long overdue nonstop flight between Washington Reagan Airport and San Antonio.  

In April 2023, I led a letter with the San Antonio delegation to build support for this important flight. Additionally, in the Rules Committee on which I serve, we secured a vote on an amendment to add 7 more direct flights to DCA. Though this amendment fell just short in the House, it demonstrated enormous support and helped pave the way for the compromise of 5 additional slots at DCA that we saw in the Senate-passed FAA bill led by Senator Ted Cruz in May 2024. Finally, in July 2024, Senator Ted Cruz and I led a letter to the Department of Transportation (DOT) urging the Biden Administration to award San Antonio with one of the nonstop flight spots. 

Today, the people of San Antonio saw the results of the San Antonio delegation's work toward achieving this priority. I am proud to know that the men and women of Military City, U.S.A will finally be able to fly directly to the airport next door to the Pentagon and that all those in the region can visit their nation's capital more easily.

I’d like to thank Senator Ted Cruz for his steadfast leadership and work on this effort.  I would also like to thank Senator Cornyn, Rep. Henry Cuellar, Rep. Joaquin Castro, Rep. Greg Casar, Rep. Tony Gonzales, and Mayor Nirenberg for banding together to deliver this priority.

'1894788977648893982',"🚨 REP. ROY STATEMENT ON HOUSE PASSAGE OF BUDGET RESOLUTION 🚨

""Congress is so pitiful that the mere fact of a budget resolution reducing the growth of so-called 'mandatory' (i.e., automatic) spending—and tying the extension of tax cuts to those spending reductions—is, sadly, an historic event.

By passing the budget resolution, we forced congressional spending addicts to admit they have a problem.  For the first time in my memory, we forced the House to admit it must cut overall spending to address the 'inflation tax' crushing the dreams of every hardworking American family and young adult.

Admitting you have a problem doesn’t fix it. Congress must significantly reduce the size of deficits, and as drafted, this resolution only scratches the surface—but it provides a framework that gives us the chance to deliver.

First, we established a floor of $1.5 trillion in 'mandatory' spending reductions, which will require Congress to work on needed reforms to Medicaid, food stamps, and other programs plagued by waste, fraud, and abuse. If we don’t treat it as a floor and achieve greater spending reductions, we won’t shrink deficits.

Second, we budgeted for significant tax relief for Americans by extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts. We also tied any additional tax reductions to achieving further spending cuts. If we don’t maintain that connection, we won’t reduce deficits.

Third, we set an expectation for Congress to fulfill the efforts of DOGE to rein in out-of-control spending. DOGE shouldn’t just be a tool to expose bad contracts or for Republicans to fundraise on—it should drive and motivate Congress to shrink the size and scope of the federal government.

Finally, my support last night was contingent on additional crucial actions in a final reconciliation bill: an effective discretionary spending freeze that accounts for future emergency spending, the full eradication of Green New Deal IRA subsidies, and the termination of Joe Biden’s student loan bailout, among others.

We took one necessary step, but there are many miles to go.

The American people want results—and this budget resolution sets a framework to deliver them, along with reassurance that this Republican trifecta is putting America first. But only if we deliver.""",en,Tweet,18,303,92,46,17978,2025-02-26 16:37:50,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

I am pleased that — after too much delay — the Senate has confirmed Kash Patel today as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Americans across the country have lost faith in the bureau's ability to fulfill its mission to the American people and the Constitution. Instead of targeting real criminals and public safety threats, FBI leadership has been focused for too long on politicized witch hunts ranging from President Trump and his team to concerned parents like my friend Scott Smith and pro-life Americans like Mark Houck.

As a former federal prosecutor and First Assistant Attorney General of Texas, it’s important to me that Director Patel has made clear his mission to serve as the disruptor America needs at the FBI.  He is poised to end the corruption, politicization, and weaponization that have taken the FBI away from its designated mission — much of which has exploded in the post 9/11 drift toward loose definitions of domestic terrorism that have moved the department off the path of combatting organized crime across state lines.

'1890236201463845246',"🚨 REP. ROY STATEMENT ON BUDGET RESOLUTION 🚨

“Today I voted to report the Chairman’s FY25 Budget Resolution out of the Budget Committee. I did so with reservations due to the urgency of our current debt crisis and my concern that there is insufficient resolve in Congress to address that crisis, thus leaving Americans with the devastating tax of inflation and high interest rates.  Yet the bill would — if adopted by Republicans on the House floor — represent an historic level of spending reductions paired with extension and expansion of President Trump’s tax policies and would take a significant step down the path to fiscal sanity while simultaneously delivering on critical portions of President Trump's agenda.

It was not easy to reach this point. My Budget Committee colleagues — along with support from the House Freedom Caucus — had to push hard to achieve the spending cuts included in this resolution. We did what members of Congress are supposed to do: we deliberated, negotiated, and legislated. Chairman Jodey Arrington deserves particular compensation for standing strong and showing true leadership and resilience during this process.

What we achieved through those talks is a plan to do what the American people want it to do: cut wasteful spending and keep taxes low. Today's budget resolution will enable us to reach $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and potentially more than $2 trillion in spending cuts over ten years.

While I believe we should be able to do far better than a mere annual $200 Billion of reductions on over $7 trillion in total annual spending, the bill will supplement Elon Musk’s and DOGE's mission to eradicate government waste, and it lays the foundation to fully unleash the Trump economic agenda. Further, this plan takes away Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats' ability to hold the economy hostage by raising the debt ceiling coupled with reducing spending.

Most urgently, this sets us up to rush $300 billion in funding for border security, immigration enforcement and the military so those critical missions continue uninterrupted.

The American people expect us to deliver and we have a duty to do what we said. Today's resolution is an important part of doing so.  Onward.”",en,Tweet,37,1146,232,268,156539,2025-02-14 03:06:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
