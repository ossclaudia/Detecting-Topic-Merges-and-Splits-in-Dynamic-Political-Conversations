This is what fiscal sanity looks like: cutting the fat while protecting those who truly matter—our veterans, seniors, and students. The days of government-by-giveaway are over.

I want to thank OMB Director @russvought for his work in crafting this blueprint for common-sense spending and responsible governance.

This organization has been led by incredible mentors of mine, including Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Jim Jordan, Senator-Elect Jim Banks, and current Chairman Kevin Hern. I want to thank Chairman Hern for his leadership of the RSC over the last two years and for effectively utilizing our slim majority in the House of Representatives to push back against the Biden-Harris Agenda.
 
As Chairman, I am committed to championing policies that protect our freedoms, ensure national security, and foster economic prosperity for all Americans. The RSC will continue to be the conservative backbone of the House, pushing for a strong, resilient America that can stand up to both foreign adversaries and domestic challenges. 

Together, we will work to advance conservative principles and make life better for hardworking Americans, while holding the line on runaway spending, promoting energy dominance, and securing our borders.",en,Tweet,8,335,47,76,84483,2024-11-15 15:06:50,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcbziZ7WIAAfGkT.jpg
