A. Tax cuts for all American families are made permanent
B. Border security funding to enable the deportation of illegals
C. No tax on tips & overtime
D. Prohibits funds for transgender treatments
E. Protects life by restricting Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood

Now let me be clear — I didn’t just cast a vote. I worked my tail off during this process to make this bill better for the American taxpayer. I fought tooth and nail to include key changes that were non-negotiable for me:

1. Work requirements for Medicaid recipients were moved up from 2029 to 2026
2. Biden’s Green New Scam tax credits for wind and solar repealed faster

Later, he served as the Governor of Georgia before being elected as President of the United States. He was the author of 32 books and the co-founder of the Carter Center, a non-profit public policy organization involved in a wide variety of efforts to help resolve international conflicts and promote democracy. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. In his spare time, President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, worked to build or repair over 4,000 homes through Habitat for Humanity, according to that organization.
