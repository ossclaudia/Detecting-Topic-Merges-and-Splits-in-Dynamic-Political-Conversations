'1966551529663471748',"Yesterday, a rigged panel of five judges that included Alexandre de Moraes—a sanctioned human rights abuser and known hater of Bolsonaro—Lula’s former personal attorney, and Lula’s former minister of justice unjustly convicted former President @jairbolsonaro of plotting a coup simply for questioning the integrity of Brazil’s highly disputed and entirely electronic 2022 election, sentencing him to 27 years imprisonment and preventing him for running for reelection in 2026—all without a shred of evidence that he’s guilty of any crime. 

These criminal thugs on Brazil’s Supreme Court don’t deserve to be called decent humans, let alone “justices.” Only one judge on the panel—Justice Fux, who’s no friend to Bolsonaro—had the courage to call Bolsonaro’s prosecution what the world already knows it is: political lawfare aimed at destroying an innocent man, imprisoning a great political leader for the rest of his life, and punishing millions of freedom-loving Brazilians for supporting the candidate of their choice and questioning the integrity of Brazil’s electronic voting machines. 

As @SecRubio pointed out, the United States will not tolerate Brazil’s further descent into totalitarianism.
