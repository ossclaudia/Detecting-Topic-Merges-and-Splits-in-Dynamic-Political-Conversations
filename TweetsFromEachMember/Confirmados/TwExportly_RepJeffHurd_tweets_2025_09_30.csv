'1968427318268842344',"On this Constitution Day, it’s worth remembering what Alexander Hamilton said in the Federalist Papers: “The vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty,” and “a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government.”

It’s a reminder that those who shout the loudest about “the rights of the people” aren’t always the ones most committed to protecting them. The Founders understood that liberty and good government go hand in hand, that noise isn’t principle, and that ambition dressed up in slogans is still ambition. Real liberty depends on order, accountability, and the quiet work of principled self-government. #ConstitutionDay #CO03",en,Tweet,4,39,10,333,24351,2025-09-17 22:30:18,"<a href=""https://www.hootsuite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Hootsuite Inc.</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1FCNjxXQAA-91d.jpg
