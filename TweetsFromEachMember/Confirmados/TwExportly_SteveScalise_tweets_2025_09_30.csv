'1965905827883372626',"I am incredibly sad and disgusted to hear of the passing of Charlie Kirk. Charlie was a loving father, husband, and conservative warrior. He was a man of deep faith and dedicated his life to educating people about civil dialogue while passionately articulating conservative values.

Charlie built a movement by traveling across the country and encouraging young people to engage in thoughtful, peaceful political discourse. He never shied from disagreement; instead, he shared with students the value of having civil conversations with people who hold different opinions – something we need more of today. To see his life taken by political violence is absolutely heartbreaking.

Political violence is NEVER acceptable. The perpetrator of this horrific act must be held accountable, and I strongly support all of our law enforcement officials as they continue their investigation. It’s past time for the incendiary rhetoric to come to an end, and we must see universal condemnation of this gruesome act.

Charlie has inspired a generation of young people by challenging the status quo and standing up for his beliefs. His legacy will live on in his friends, family, countless followers, and in the movement he built and energized.

- Let more than 1,000 noncitizens/ineligible individuals on their voter rolls

Liberal states deliberately creating magnets for illegal immigration are making the Biden-Harris border crisis even worse.",en,Tweet,6,280,112,43,9948,2024-10-02 02:30:25,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1841214182966124958',"🚨🚨 My full statement with @SpeakerJohnson, @GOPMajorityWhip, and @RepStefanik on Iran’s direct attack on our ally Israel:

Iran is again brazenly attacking Israel with a barrage of rocket fire and an apparent coordinated terrorist attack. The world is watching as Israeli families seek safety and shelter as waves of missile attacks light up the sky. We pray for their safety and urge the Biden-Harris Administration to deliver a strong message to the Iranian regime that this unjustified violence and terror must end. The strategy of appeasement has failed, and a policy of interdiction is not enough.
 
American leadership has never been more important, and the world should know that the United States will continue to stand firmly with Israel as it fights for its very survival. Our adversaries are carrying out increasingly dangerous attacks because of Biden and Harris' weak and failed foreign policy. The world needs America to return to a maximum pressure campaign against Iran, and President Biden needs to make clear that there will be decisive economic and potential military ramifications for these actions.",en,Tweet,0,104,24,54,15999,2024-10-01 21:30:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1839778382709489898',"🚨 This is the dangerous reality of Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris's WEAK border &amp; deportation policies:

13,000+ noncitizens convicted of homicide &amp; 15,000+ noncitizens convicted of sexual assault are loose in our communities according to ICE.

A total failure to keep Americans safe.",en,Tweet,3,488,147,56,15595,2024-09-27 22:25:22,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
