'1970576135273804010',"To the countries that have recognized a Palestinian state: you are choosing to reward terror over peace. Hamas has rejected every reasonable offer to end the conflict. They continue to hold innocent hostages, launch rockets, and glorify the October 7th massacre. By offering recognition now, you are not advancing peace—you are encouraging more violence.

The truth is simple: there is no Palestinian state. What exists is territory controlled by terrorists with no borders, no capital, no currency, no functioning government, and no legitimate leaders. Recognition under these conditions is not diplomacy, it is appeasement. If you truly care about peace, then demand one thing first: release the hostages. Until that happens, every recognition of “Palestine” is nothing more than a reward for Hamas for choosing terror over diplomacy!",en,Tweet,0,17,0,1,466,2025-09-23 20:48:56,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1970505022078099943',"Shutdown Schumer and Senate Democrats are threatening to close the government unless they get billions for illegal immigrants, taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries, bailouts for insurance companies, and more money for NPR.

They’re not fighting to protect seniors. They’re not fighting to lower costs for families. They’re not fighting to secure the border. They’re fighting for radical pet projects that nobody outside of the far Left even wants.

@HouseGOP already passed a common-sense bill to keep the government open, freeze spending for 50 days, and force debate on real appropriations.

But Schumer and the Democrats would rather shut the government down than give up a single dollar of their failed agenda. They want to gut the $50 billion rural health fund. They want to strip protections from patients and taxpayers. And they want to send your hard-earned dollars to criminals and illegal immigrants instead of to law-abiding Americans.

We’re not going to cave to that. We’re not going to trade away the future of this country just so the radical Left can keep their pet projects alive.

'1969850274887114835',"I'm watching speaker after speaker honor Charlie Kirk, and what I'm witnessing represents something far more significant than a funeral service.

We are not simply mourning the loss of a conservative leader, we are observing the emergence of a new generation of American patriots who understand that the future of our republic now rests in their hands.

Charlie Kirk demonstrated what becomes possible when one individual refuses to surrender their convictions to the forces of political correctness and cultural decay. He possessed the moral clarity to speak uncomfortable truths when others remained silent. He had the courage to stand firm when others retreated. He inspired millions of Americans to reclaim their voice, defend their values, and fight for their country. And the young leaders who carry his torch today understand that failure is not an option.

The radical left and their allies in the establishment better understand this: what Charlie built cannot be torn down by cancel culture, cannot be destroyed by media attacks, and cannot be defeated by political persecution. It is built on the solid foundation of faith in God, commitment to truth, and love of country.

Charlie understood what too many in Washington have forgotten—that politics is not about personal ambition or partisan advantage. Politics is about preserving the constitutional principles that made America exceptional. Politics is about ensuring that our children inherit a nation where freedom still means something.

His message was clear and uncompromising: Build strong families. Raise patriotic children. Defend our institutions. Pass down our values. Choose principle over convenience, truth over popularity, courage over comfort.

That is Charlie Kirk's enduring legacy. That is the foundation upon which the next generation of conservative leaders will stand.

Today we honor a patriot. Tomorrow we continue his work.

What is happening now is entirely different. Celebrating the murder of an innocent man is not a harmless opinion, it crosses every moral line.

They enriched uranium beyond civilian levels, violated international agreements, and ignored repeated IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) warnings. This wasn’t speculation—it was a calculated sprint toward nuclear capability by a regime that chants “Death to America.”

President Trump gave Iran a 60-day diplomatic off-ramp. They chose escalation.

A nuclear Iran is exactly what China, Russia, and North Korea want. It advances their shared anti-American agenda and pushes the world toward conflict.

President Trump has been clear: Iran must NEVER have nuclear weapons. He’s backed that stance with strength, restraint, and strategic clarity.
