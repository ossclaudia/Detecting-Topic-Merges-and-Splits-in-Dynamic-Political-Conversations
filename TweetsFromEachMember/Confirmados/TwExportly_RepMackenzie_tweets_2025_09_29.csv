'1910773309228064926',"Hi Veronica, happy to help. Here's the first result from Google showing a recent case during the Biden Administration in which measles swept through a migrant shelter. Unfortunately, as the authors of the report noted, there was ""low measles vaccination coverage among shelter residents."" This shouldn’t be surprising because immunization rates against measles have plummeted in recent years throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, according to UNICEF. 

Open borders policies like the ones you've supported have allowed millions of illegal immigrants to come into the country, most coming from countries with far lower rates of immunization than we have here in the United States. That lowers our nation's average immunization rate and threatens public health. I hope that helps, and feel free to start working with me to prevent outbreaks like the one in Chicago.",en,Tweet,2,26,6,34,3569,2025-04-11 20:13:52,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoRsuY6WIAAH_Gy.jpg

First up: securing the border.

Since taking office, we have begun the process of securing America’s borders once and for all.

✅ Border crossings falling to the lowest levels on record.
✅ Major disruptions to cartel operations and fentanyl trafficking.
✅ Introduction of my bill to mandate the use of E-Verify for all federal contracts.
✅ Passage of the Laken Riley Act, requiring illegal immigrants who commit certain crimes to be deported immediately.
 ✅Passage of a continuing resolution that fully funds efforts to deport criminal illegal immigrants.

We’ve made incredible progress, but we still have work to do. In the coming months, I will be working from my positions on the House Committees on Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs to fully secure the border, deport all criminal illegal immigrants, halt the flow of drugs, crack down on the cartels, and expand the use of E-Verify in order to protect American workers.",en,Tweet,0,5,1,6,558,2025-04-09 17:33:44,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoG2XYqW0AE6Jmv.jpg

'1900673695263097113',"Despite the attempt by some to take us back to the days of partisan gridlock, a clear, bipartisan majority in the U.S. Senate — including Sens. Fetterman and McCormick — joined those of us in the U.S. House who voted to keep the government open and deliver results that the American people are counting on. By funding the expedited deportation of criminals, supporting our military service members, and standing up for working families and seniors, we’ve shown what can be accomplished when we prioritize the needs of our citizens. 

The bipartisan continuing resolution largely keeps the government funded at 2024 levels but also includes critical new spending, including:

Major investments in national security and public safety
✅ $485 million to help clear the backlog of deportations.
✅ Expanded funding for cybersecurity.
✅ $5.8 billion for naval vessels.
✅ $750 million for air traffic controllers.

Support for veterans and service members
✅ $1.6 billion to fund the largest pay increase for junior enlisted soldiers in over 40 years.
✅ $6 billion in funding for veterans' healthcare.

Relief for seniors and working families
✅ Over $500 million for WIC
✅ $36 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (food packages for seniors)",en,Tweet,0,8,2,8,534,2025-03-14 22:21:36,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GmB5MDtWIAEMBBu.jpg

During that ride, we were involved in a high-speed chase as we tracked down an individual who was in the country illegally and was fleeing by vehicle after a traffic stop.
