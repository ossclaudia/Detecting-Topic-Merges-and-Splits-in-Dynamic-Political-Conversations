The Battle of Chickamauga occurred between the US Army of the Cumberland, led by Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans, and the Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by Gen. Braxton Bragg. Rosecrans aimed to drive the Confederates out of Chattanooga. In early September, he consolidated his forces and pushed Bragg's army south.

Bragg sought to retake Chattanooga, intending to strike Rosecrans’s isolated troops. A miscommunication led Rosecrans to create an actual gap in his defenses, which Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet exploited, resulting in a rout of Union forces. The Union ultimately retreated to Chattanooga, while the Confederates took control of the surrounding heights, besieging the city.

His bombing spree began in 1978, starting with an un-mailed package that injured a security guard. Over the next several years, Kaczynski mailed homemade pipe bombs to various targets, including executives at American and United Airlines and academic administrators, resulting in several injuries. The violence led to the death of a computer store owner in California. Ultimately, the Unabomber carried out 14 attacks with 16 bombs.

Kaczynski promised to halt his attacks if his manifesto was published in full by a major outlet. In his manifesto, Kaczynski contended that technology had distanced humans from nature. He advocated for a return to “wild nature,” arguing that this necessitated an end to all scientific research.

Kaczynski's brother, David, recognized the writing style as that of Ted, who was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

'1968277112718086356',"On this day in history in 1787, 39 delegates signed the Constitution of the United States of America. 

Today, on National Constitution Day, we honor the courage and vision of the men who drafted and signed this historic document—establishing the framework of a democratic republic and safeguarding our individual rights and liberties.

Before the Constitution, the country was governed under the Articles of Confederation, adopted prior to Britain’s surrender in 1781. The Articles created a loose confederation of states, granting Congress authority over foreign affairs, war, and currency, but denying it the power to enforce laws, raise funds, or compel troops, threatening the stability of the Union. A meeting in Annapolis paved the way for a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.

In 1787, delegates from every state but Rhode Island gathered in Philadelphia. George Washington was chosen to preside over the convention. The delegates drafted a new framework of government, based on federalism, separation of powers, and checks and balances.

The Constitution was signed on September 17, 1787, but it required ratification by nine states before taking effect. While five states quickly ratified, others—including Massachusetts—insisted on greater protections for individual liberties. 

Ratification was ultimately secured through a promise to adopt amendments addressing these concerns. That commitment gave rise to the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution, ratified in 1791.",en,Tweet,1,110,26,19,4795,2025-09-17 12:33:27,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1C5mhTXAAA18gL.jpg

She is not only wrong, but a perfect illustration of how Democrats have become radicalized and so far out of touch with reality.

Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03 a.m., United Airlines Flight 175, another Boeing 767, struck the south tower near the 60th floor.

The attacks were soon revealed to be part of a coordinated effort by Islamic terrorists from Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations, financed by Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda. They had been living in the U.S. and received flight training and hijacked four planes.

At 9:37 a.m., American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.

The south tower of the World Trade Center collapsed at 9:59 a.m., followed by the north tower at 10:28 a.m., due to the intense heat from the burning jet fuel compromising the structural integrity of the skyscrapers.

The Battle of Kursk, fought in southwestern Russia, was a major clash between Germany and the Soviet Union, culminating in a Soviet victory. This battle, the largest of World War II is often regarded as a key turning point in the war. 

Known for its intense and costly nature, it’s the deadliest armored engagement in history and saw the opening day, July 5, become the most lethal day in aerial warfare. The confrontation began with Germany's Operation Citadel, aimed at encircling the Kursk salient through simultaneous assaults from the north and south.

'1958863030281805844',"On this day in history in 1992, the infamous Ruby Ridge standoff continued. 

Randy Weaver and his family lived atop a mountain in remote Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Weaver was targeted by the government after selling two sawed-off shotguns to an Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearm (ATF) informant working to catch him. Weaver was let off on bail but failed to appear at court after his defense provided him with the wrong court date. 

After this, ATF handed the case over to the US Marshals, who began surveillance on Weaver and his property by installing various cameras. On August 21, Weaver, his friend, Kevin Harris, his 14 year-old son, Sammy, chased after their dog, Striker, on the family property. They came across an armed, camouflaged man who failed to state that he was a federal agent. The marshal shot and killed the dog before pointing his gun at Sammy, causing Sammy to shoot at the marshal. Sammy was shot in the back while running away from the unmarked agent.

The Weaver family refused to surrender, and the standoff began. The US Marshals then handed the case to the FBI, conveying that a militia group killed a federal agent. Neighbors were evacuated from their homes, roads near Ruby Ridge were closed, and the governor declared a state of emergency. 

The next day, an FBI sniper 200 yards away shot and wounded Weaver and Harris and fatally shot his wife, Vicki Weaver, who was holding their infant daughter.

Nine days later, on August 31, Harris, Weaver, and his three daughters surrendered.

Weaver was initially tried, but was acquitted on all charges except for the original charges of the violation of bail and failure to appear. Weaver filed a civil lawsuit and won over $3 million.",en,Tweet,12,309,58,46,13789,2025-08-22 13:05:14,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gy9HigZXsAAYkvj.jpg

'1890014053222793289',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1861, the first military action to earn a Medal of Honor occurred.

During the U.S.-Apache conflict, Colonel Bernard J.D. Irwin, an assistant army surgeon, volunteered to rescue Second Lieutenant George N. Bascom, who was trapped by the Apaches near Arizona. Irwin led 14 men on a 100-mile journey, initially without horses, and managed to break the siege by capturing Apaches and recovering stolen livestock. 

This conflict had started when Apache chief Cochise kidnapped a young boy. Although Irwin's heroic actions occurred during the conflict, the Medal of Honor was not established until 1862, and Irwin received it in 1894.",en,Tweet,2,71,8,9,13958,2025-02-13 12:23:59,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gjqtw7vWoAEJqQo.jpg

'1889291528004403399',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1766, Virginia declares the Stamp Act as unconstitutional. 

In 1765, Britain was still struggling financially as a result of the French and Indian War, so to raise enough revenue, the Stamp Act was introduced. This tax required a stamp to be placed on various legal documents, newspapers, and other materials in the American colonies. It was the first direct tax levied by the British government on the colonies.

In Virginia, Patrick Henry led the Virginia Resolves, which argued that only the Virginia Assembly could impose taxes on its people. This sentiment fueled the idea of ""no taxation without representation."" The Virginia Resolves sparked broader colonial resistance, leading to the Stamp Act Congress in New York, where delegates outlined their objections to the British government.

In response to the protests and pressure, King George III eventually repealed the act in March 1766.",en,Tweet,6,118,21,16,8082,2025-02-11 12:32:56,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GjgcoRIWwAALNUU.jpg

The exchange took place on Berlin's Glienicker Bridge, with Powers and Abel crossing to freedom simultaneously.

Powers had been captured in 1960 after his U-2 reconnaissance plane was shot down by a Soviet missile while over Soviet airspace. Initially, the U.S. believed he had died, but Soviet Premier Khrushchev later revealed Powers was alive and had confessed to his mission. This exposed the U.S. cover-up, causing embarrassment for President Eisenhower just before a critical summit.

He won the Republican nomination in 1980 and defeated incumbent Jimmy Carter to become president. At 69, he was the oldest person to hold the office.

Buddy Holly, just 22, had been a rising star in rock and roll, his music influencing artists such as Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney. J.P. Richardson, 28, had found fame as a DJ and songwriter. Ritchie Valens, only 17, had already made an impact with songs like ""La Bamba"" and ""Donna.""

This policy, initially introduced in 1915, declared the waters around the British Isles a war zone, where German U-boats would attack all merchant ships, including those from neutral nations. The sinking of the British Lusitania, which killed 1,201 people including 128 Americans, led to strong condemnation from the U.S. and a demand for Germany to cease attacking unarmed merchant vessels. 

Afterwards, Germany had limited U-boat attacks, but the navy continued to push for a more aggressive strategy. By early 1917, Germany's military leadership convinced Kaiser Wilhelm to approve resuming unrestricted submarine warfare, believing it could lead to victory by that fall. Despite opposition from the Chancellor, who feared antagonizing the U.S., the kaiser supported the decision, and he announced the resumption of unrestricted U-boat warfare, declaring Germany would ""stake everything"" and fight to the end.",en,Tweet,0,21,4,2,3645,2025-02-01 12:03:15,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gis18E5XIAACI2V.jpg

These events, combined with the Soviets' knowledge of hydrogen bomb technology, led Truman to approve significant funding for the race to develop the first thermonuclear weapon.

In 1952, the U.S. successfully tested the hydrogen bomb, codenamed ""Mike.” The 10.4-megaton bomb vaporized an island and created a crater over a mile wide. Its mushroom cloud reached 120,000 feet and spread 60 miles wide within half an hour. In 1955, the Soviet Union tested its own hydrogen bomb, marking the start of the nuclear arms race between the superpowers and the world’s first threat of thermonuclear war.",en,Tweet,3,36,4,4,3552,2025-01-31 12:34:18,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GinzdHsWEAE4mJT.jpg

'1884942337052131716',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1835, Andrew Jackson became the first U.S. president to survive an assassination attempt. 

Richard Lawrence, an unemployed painter, tried to shoot Jackson as he was leaving a funeral at the Capitol. However, his gun misfired. Jackson, 67, responded by attacking Lawrence with his cane. During the struggle, Lawrence drew a second pistol, but it misfired as well. Jackson's aides then subdued Lawrence, leaving the president unharmed but shaken. 

Although Lawrence appeared mentally unstable and had no known political connections, Jackson believed his assassination attempt was orchestrated by his Whig Party opponents, who were at odds with him over his efforts to dismantle the Bank of the United States. 

Despite no evidence to support this claim, Jackson remained paranoid, and his vice president, Martin Van Buren, began carrying two loaded pistols for protection. Lawrence was committed to a mental institution, and later tests showed both of his pistols malfunctioned by chance, with the odds of such a misfire calculated at 1 in 125,000.",en,Tweet,3,95,12,10,4590,2025-01-30 12:30:48,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiipELFWQAAX7qj.jpg

Coca-Cola was originally created in 1886 by pharmacist John Pemberton, who developed the beverage as a medicinal tonic. The formula, which originally contained cocaine, was sold in 1889 to Asa Candler, who incorporated the company.

A few years later, Coca-Cola was being sold nationwide, and the company quickly grew. Coca-Cola's marketing, led by Candler, helped establish the brand's dominance, and by 1948, it held about 60% of the market share. Over time, the company expanded through various acquisitions, including Minute Maid and Columbia Pictures (which was sold to Sony in 1989).",en,Tweet,1,54,14,11,3748,2025-01-29 12:16:18,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GidcKEtXoAAD1Gz.jpg

Sir Winston Churchill, the British leader who led Great Britain and the Allies through World War II l, was born in 1874 at Blenheim Palace. He began his career in the military, serving in India, Sudan, and South Africa before shifting to politics.

Though blamed for the failed Gallipoli campaign during WWI and briefly sidelined from politics, Churchill returned to the cabinet in 1917 and rejoined the Conservative party. Throughout the 1930s, he warned of the rising Nazi and Japanese threats, often ignored.

With the outbreak of World War II, Churchill became first lord of the admiralty again and later prime minister in 1940. His leadership was crucial in uniting Britain against the Axis powers, forging vital alliances with the US and USSR. 

After Germany’s defeat, he lost the 1945 election but eventually returned as prime minister. Churchill was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II shortly before he retired in 1955.

Russia, under the weak rule of Nicholas II, was losing the Russo-Japanese War and facing severe internal unrest. The war fueled dissatisfaction while revolutionary leaders, including the exiled Lenin, were rallying support for a socialist uprising. 

In late 1904, a conference of regional governments demanded reforms, but the czar ignored them, pushing radical groups to take more direct action. Workers marched to the czar’s Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, seeking reforms. Imperial troops opened fire, killing and wounding hundreds, sparking nationwide protests, strikes, and riots. 

In response, Nicholas promised to create representative assemblies to address reform, but the regime remained largely repressive. Over the next decade, revolutionary movements, especially Lenin's Bolsheviks, gained strength, and internal tensions escalated, culminating in Russia’s collapse under the strain of World War I.",en,Tweet,3,52,9,56,36490,2025-01-22 12:33:01,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gh5c2jCW0AAtKWK.jpg

'1881673561229996082',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1793, King Louis XVI was executed by guillotine after being convicted of conspiracy with foreign powers and sentenced to death by the French National Convention. 

Louis, who became king in 1774, struggled with the financial crisis inherited from his grandfather. In 1789, he convened the States-General to address the crisis, but the commoner declared itself the National Assembly, sparking the French Revolution. 

Though he initially accepted the revolution, Louis resisted reforms and supported reactionary elements, including his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1789, a mob forced the royal family to move to Paris, and the king and queen tried to flee to Austria but were captured. Louis was then reduced to a symbolic monarch under the 1791 constitution. The next year, the monarchy was abolished, and Louis was arrested. 

In November, evidence of his treasonous dealings with Austria emerged, leading to his trial and conviction for treason. Nine months later, Marie Antoinette was also convicted of treason and executed.",en,Tweet,2,26,7,45,18871,2025-01-21 12:01:51,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gh0MIOmXQAILnHY.jpg

Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led a team of 50 people, including the Native American guide Sacagawea, to explore the vast Louisiana Territory. Their journey surveyed land from present-day North Dakota to Texas, crossed the Rockies, and reached the Pacific coast in Oregon, fueling interest in westward expansion.

Jefferson had proposed such an expedition even before the U.S. acquired the Louisiana Territory from France. Napoleon, seeking funds for his European campaigns, sold the land to the United States.

'1879505606215635412',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 2009, Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger landed US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River after taking off from LaGuardia Airport in New York City. 

The flight, with 155 people on board, was en route to Charlotte, North Carolina. Just two minutes into the flight, the aircraft struck a flock of Canada geese, severely damaging both engines and causing a complete loss of thrust. Despite efforts to restart the engines, the plane was unable to regain power.

As the aircraft began losing altitude, Sullenberger quickly realized that returning to LaGuardia was impossible, and nearby airports in New Jersey were also out of reach. With limited options, Sullenberger made the bold decision to attempt a water landing in the Hudson River. He informed passengers over the intercom to “Brace for impact.” The plane landed in the river with the tail section making first contact.

The incident and Sullenberger’s role in it were later dramatized in the 2016 film 𝑆𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑦, directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks as the captain.

In a strategic move, Octavian appeared before the Senate and, in a symbolic gesture, formally relinquished his powers, returning authority to the Senate and the citizens of Rome. 

However, this act was largely ceremonial. In response, the Senate granted him control over key provinces such as Spain, Gaul, and Syria.

While Native Americans had lived in the area for centuries, it wasn’t until 1869 that geologist John Wesley Powell led the first challenging journey through the canyon, navigating the Colorado River.

By the late 19th century, the Grand Canyon had become a popular tourist destination, attracting figures like Roosevelt, who had a deep appreciation for the American West. Roosevelt famously stated, “Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is… what you can do is keep it for your children, your children’s children, and all who come after you.”

Congress officially made the Grand Canyon a national park in 1919, banning private development.

When Caesar's term in Gaul ended, the Senate demanded that he disband his army and return to Rome as a private citizen or be declared an enemy of the state. This put Caesar in a vulnerable position, as he could face prosecution for actions during his consulship and campaigns. Caesar chose to act, crossing the Rubicon with his army during the night. By doing so, he declared war on Rome, uttering the phrase ""Alea iacta est"" (""The die is cast"").

'1876966529410977824',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1835, President Andrew Jackson succeeded in paying off the U.S. national debt, marking the only time in American history that the debt stood at zero. 

However, this achievement contributed to one of the worst financial crises the country would face. Jackson, influenced by his personal aversion to debt from a failed land deal, opposed the national bank and viewed debt as destructive. During his presidency, he vetoed spending bills, rejected infrastructure projects, and sold government lands to eliminate the debt.

While Jackson's actions initially succeeded in reducing the debt, they led to economic instability. The land sales inflated a real estate bubble, and the dismantling of the national bank resulted in excessive borrowing and spending. These factors, combined with foreign economic downturns, culminated in the Panic of 1837, which plunged the U.S. into a depression and forced the government to resume borrowing. 

The national debt has persisted ever since, growing significantly during the Civil War and World War I. Although many presidents have pledged to eliminate it, the U.S. debt now exceeds $37 trillion.",en,Tweet,6,112,14,20,5620,2025-01-08 12:17:47,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgxTG9dWEAAswCM.jpg

'1875521513824383162',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1847, Samuel Colt secured a crucial contract to supply 1,000 .44 caliber revolvers to the government, saving his struggling gun company.

Before Colt's mass production of revolvers, handguns were rare and impractical, often expensive, inaccurate, and preferred mostly by elites for formal duels. The average American, especially in the West, favored knives for self-defense. This changed with Colt's invention of the percussion-repeating revolver, which featured a revolving chamber holding multiple shots, making it more practical for quick combat. While not as accurate as rifles, the revolver's rapid-fire ability made up for this shortcoming.

Colt's early success was fueled by government contracts, which allowed him to scale production. Colt developed mass production techniques, reducing costs and making revolvers more affordable. Colt’s guns became popular during the California Gold Rush, and by 1860, he had sold over 268,000 revolvers, largely to civilians seeking self-defense in the Wild West.",en,Tweet,1,50,6,7,3450,2025-01-04 12:35:49,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ggcw3_AXEAAWwEs.jpg

'1874060985012555856',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1999, the United States officially transferred control of the Panama Canal to Panama, marking the first time the waterway was under Panamanian ownership. 

The 50-mile canal, linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, had been in U.S. hands since its completion in 1914. Over one million ships had passed through the canal by then.

The idea of a canal across Panama dates back to the early 1500s, with various plans proposed but never realized. U.S. interest grew in the mid-1800s, spurred by the California Gold Rush and the need for a shortcut between the oceans.

President Theodore Roosevelt pushed for the project, and in 1903, Panama gained independence from Colombia with U.S. support. The U.S. and Panama signed the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, giving the U.S. control of the canal zone in exchange for a $10 million payment and annual rent.

In 1977, after decades of Panamanian protests, the Torrijos-Carter Treaties were signed, setting the stage for the 1999 handover. The treaties gave the U.S. the right to defend the canal's neutrality but handed control to Panama.",en,Tweet,2,34,9,16,4781,2024-12-31 11:52:11,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgIAiILXsAAVCcv.jpg

He became vice president under John Quincy Adams in 1824 and was re-elected in 1828 alongside Jackson. 

However, Calhoun soon became politically isolated from Jackson’s administration regarding the high tariff stance on imported goods preferred by the quickly industrializing North. Calhoun argued for nullification, allowing states to ignore federal laws they thought were unconstitutional. President Jackson declared nullification as treasonous and threatened military force when South Carolina declared tariffs null and void within the state.

The Germans aimed to capture Bastogne due to its strategic location at a critical road junction. Defended by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division, the town was under heavy siege, facing shortages of supplies amid harsh weather and constant German attacks. When asked to surrender, Brigadier General Anthony C. MacAuliffe famously responded with a single word: ""Nuts.""

Patton, known for his audacity, swiftly maneuvered his 3rd Army in a dramatic 90-degree turn, breaking through German lines to reach Bastogne. This timely intervention not only lifted the siege but also helped shift the momentum of the battle. Patton’s success played a key role in pushing the German forces back, eventually driving them eastward across the Rhine River, and marking a turning point in the Battle of the Bulge.",en,Tweet,1,124,21,17,10967,2024-12-26 12:50:02,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gfud0zOXMAA3LQc.jpg

This daring move came after several months of defeats, including the loss of New York City. Washington's army crossed the river at three points, with 2,400 soldiers successfully reaching New Jersey before dawn. However, the other two divisions, including soldiers and essential artillery, failed to arrive on time. By 8 a.m., Washington's force attacked the Hessian defenders, who were caught off guard and sluggish from their Christmas celebrations. The Patriots quickly overwhelmed the Hessians, capturing nearly 1,000 while suffering only four casualties. Despite this success, Washington was forced to withdraw since most of his army lacked artillery and reinforcements.

'1871533979578360051',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1814, the Treaty of Ghent officially ended the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain. 

The treaty stipulated that conquered territories would be returned and established commissions to settle the U.S.-Canada border. Despite not addressing the main issues that sparked the war—British interference with American trade and impressment of U.S. sailors—it was seen as a diplomatic victory for the U.S. as it opened the Great Lakes region for expansion.

The war began in June 1812, triggered by British economic blockades, the forced enlistment of American sailors, and British support for Native American attacks on the U.S. frontier. Initial American invasions of Canada were unsuccessful, but the U.S. Navy achieved several victories at sea. In 1814, after Napoleon's defeat, Britain focused more on the war, capturing Washington, D.C., and burning key government buildings. However, the British were repelled at Fort McHenry, inspiring the writing of the ""Star-Spangled Banner.""

The turning point came in September 1814 when the U.S. won a crucial naval battle at Lake Champlain, forcing British forces to retreat from the northeast. Though news of the treaty’s signing reached the U.S. too late to stop the Battle of New Orleans, where General Andrew Jackson's forces achieved a stunning victory, the simultaneous news of the peace settlement and the triumph at New Orleans boosted American national pride and unity.",en,Tweet,1,49,6,7,3367,2024-12-24 12:30:46,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GfkGPCWWoAEgc4g.jpg

A product of a military family, Patton graduated from West Point and competed in the 1912 Olympics as the first American pentathlete. He later served in WW1's Tank Corps, advocating for tank warfare. During WWII, he led successful campaigns, including the capture of Palermo, Sicily, in 1943, and the relief of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, using unconventional strategies.

Patton was known for his boldness and forceful leadership, famously stating, ""We herd sheep. We drive cattle. We lead people. Lead me, follow me, or get out of my way."" His bluntness and controversial behavior often put his career at risk, most notably when he slapped a soldier suffering from ""shell shock,"" leading to public backlash. However, General Dwight Eisenhower and General George Marshall intervened, and Patton returned to active duty.

The Boston Tea Party was a protest against the British Parliament's Tea Act, which aimed to save the struggling East India Company by reducing its tax on tea and granting it a monopoly on the American tea trade. Although the Tea Act didn’t raise the price of tea, it allowed the company to undercut smuggled Dutch tea, which angered many colonists who saw it as another form of British control and ""taxation without representation.""

When the governor refused to allow the tea to be sent back to Britain, Samuel Adams organized the raid with the Sons of Liberty. The destruction of tea, valued at nearly $2 million today, prompted the British to pass the Coercive Acts (Intolerable Acts), which closed Boston's ports and imposed harsher British rule in Massachusetts.

Born in 1732 in Virginia, Washington began his military career in the Virginia militia during the French and Indian War. After the war, he returned to civilian life as a planter and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he became an outspoken critic of British policies toward the colonies. He was elected to the Continental Congress in 1774, and was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. Washington led the American forces to victory, culminating in the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781.

After the war, Washington retired to Mount Vernon but returned to public service to preside over the Constitutional Convention. The following year, he was unanimously elected the first president of the United States. He served two terms, stepping down in 1797 to retire once again.

After Washington’s death, Henry Lee famously eulogized him as “First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.”",en,Tweet,0,81,15,4,4111,2024-12-14 11:54:49,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeweG1-XwAA5-iz.jpg

Hussein had ruled Iraq for over two decades, using brutal tactics to maintain power, including chemical attacks on civilians and an eight-year war with Iran. His regime collapsed after the invasion, but Saddam went into hiding, leading to an extensive manhunt by U.S. forces.

The capture, codenamed ""Red Dawn,"" was the result of months of intelligence gathering and strategic interrogations. U.S. Army interrogator Eric Maddox played a pivotal role, relying on empathy to build trust with detainees, leading him to key informants who helped pinpoint Saddam's location.

A month prior to reaching Plymouth, the ship anchored in Provincetown Harbor, where 41 male passengers signed the Mayflower Compact, agreeing to create a self-governing colony.

A constitutional crisis emerged in the British Empire when King Edward VIII announced his intention to marry Wallis Simpson, an American divorcée. This proposal faced strong opposition from the British government and the Commonwealth due to religious, legal, and moral objections. As the head of the Church of England, Edward's potential marriage to a twice-divorced woman was deemed unacceptable, as the church did not permit remarriage if the former spouse was still alive. 

Despite the objections, Edward remained determined to marry Simpson, whom he claimed to love.

'1865370104302567694',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1941, Japan launched a surprise assault on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. naval base in Hawaii, marking the U.S.'s entry into World War II. 

Tensions between the U.S. and Japan had been escalating for years due to Japan's military expansion in Asia, particularly its invasion of China. By 1941, the U.S. had cut off vital exports to Japan, including oil, and severed diplomatic relations, leading Japan to consider war.

Japan’s military leaders planned the attack on Pearl Harbor as a means to cripple the U.S. Pacific Fleet and secure unchallenged control over Southeast Asia. Despite warnings of possible Japanese aggression, U.S. military leaders did not take sufficient precautions. Tensions in Washington were high, but key warnings failed to reach Pearl Harbor in time.

The attack began at 7:55 AM with a wave of bombers, torpedo planes, and fighters targeting the U.S. fleet. The Japanese destroyed or damaged eight battleships, three cruisers, and nearly 200 aircraft, killing over 2,300 Americans. However, the U.S. aircraft carriers were not in port and survived the attack, which later proved crucial in the Pacific war.

The attack unified the U.S. public, and Congress declared war on Japan the next day with only one dissenting vote. Japan’s miscalculation led to its eventual defeat in the war. Despite the severe damage at Pearl Harbor, the U.S. was able to recover quickly, and Japan’s strategy ultimately backfired, propelling the U.S. into a total war effort that would contribute to the Allied victory but at the cost of 400,000 American lives.",en,Tweet,2,75,16,8,8116,2024-12-07 12:17:44,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeMgORDW8AARNJQ.jpg

Most of the population was massacred, and much of the city was burned. Of the 50,000 inhabitants, only around 2,000 survived.

'1864646832875295014',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1945 at 2:10 p.m., five U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo-bombers, part of Flight 19, took off from Ft. Lauderdale Naval Air Station in Florida for a routine training mission and disappeared inside the Bermuda Triangle. 

After completing their initial objective, the flight plan called for them to head east for 67 miles, then north for 73 miles, before returning to the base, totaling 120 miles. 

Two hours into the mission, the flight leader, an experienced pilot, reported compass failures and became disoriented. His instruments malfunctioned, and the other pilots experienced similar issues. Despite attempts to contact land-based radio stations, the squadron's location could not be determined. At 6:20 p.m., the flight leader sent a confused radio message suggesting that the planes may have to ditch due to fuel shortage. By then, radar had located Flight 19 north of the Bahamas, but the search was complicated by poor weather.

A search and rescue Mariner aircraft with a 13-man crew was dispatched at 7:27 p.m., but it disappeared shortly after takeoff. A tanker off the Florida coast reported seeing an explosion. Despite one of the largest air and sea searches in history, no trace of the planes or the crew members was ever found.

The disappearance of Flight 19 and the Mariner contributed to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle, a region in the Atlantic Ocean where ships and aircraft are said to mysteriously vanish.",en,Tweet,0,26,6,3,3352,2024-12-05 12:23:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeCOaV7WYAAAk4m.jpg

The session happened by chance when Perkins, already successful with “Blue Suede Shoes,” came to the studio to record a new version of “Matchbox.” Sun Records owner Sam Phillips had recently signed Lewis, a talented pianist, and brought him in to play on Perkins' session. 

Elvis Presley, at the height of his fame with RCA, visited the studio that afternoon. After listening to Perkins' recording, he joined the others in the studio, and the impromptu jam began. Johnny Cash, another Sun artist, eventually joined in. Presley left partway through the session, but Phillips kept the tape running to capture the historic moment.

The summit, the first between the two leaders, was viewed with cautious optimism by Bush and his advisers, who were eager to build on the arms control progress made during the Reagan administration. Gorbachev, however, was more outspoken, emphasizing his desire for better U.S.-Soviet relations to support his domestic reforms. He declared that the Cold War's defining elements—arms races, mistrust, and ideological conflict—should be left behind. Bush, while more reserved, expressed hope that the U.S. and Soviet Union could usher in a new era of cooperation, particularly in ending the division of Europe.

Despite the optimistic rhetoric, the summit yielded few concrete outcomes. Both leaders agreed to work toward a treaty on nuclear and conventional arms by 1990 and planned a follow-up summit for June 1990 in Washington, D.C.",en,Tweet,0,15,3,1,9202,2024-12-03 12:13:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gd3444QWsAATq3b.jpg

'1863559617675944197',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 2001, Enron Corporation filed for bankruptcy, marking the beginning of one of the largest corporate scandals in U.S. history.

Founded in 1985 through the merger of Houston Natural Gas and Internorth, Enron quickly grew into a major energy-trading company. Under CEO Kenneth Lay, the company reached #7 on Fortune's list of the top 500 U.S. companies by 2000, employing 21,000 people and generating $111 billion in revenue. However, by the end of the year, Enron’s stock price had plummeted from $90.75 in August to just $0.26 by November. As the stock dropped, Lay sold off his shares while encouraging employees to buy more, leading many to lose their retirement savings. The company’s collapse was triggered when a planned $8.4 billion buyout by Dynegy fell through, and Enron filed for bankruptcy.

Enron’s fall was later linked to widespread accounting fraud, where it hid debts and losses through off-the-books partnerships. This prompted investigations by the SEC and Justice Department, revealing that Lay and CEO Jeffrey Skilling had conspired to mislead investors about the company’s financial health. The scandal also implicated Arthur Andersen, Enron’s auditor, which was found guilty of destroying incriminating documents. Although Andersen’s conviction was later overturned, the damage to its reputation led to the firm's downfall.

In 2004, Skilling and Lay were indicted and convicted on multiple charges, including fraud and insider trading. The trial saw former executives, including CFO Andrew Fastow, testify against Lay and Skilling. Fastow had pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and cooperated with prosecutors. Lay died of heart disease shortly after the verdict, leading to the dismissal of charges against him. Skilling, sentenced to over 24 years in prison, served about 12 years before his release in 2019.

Enron’s collapse cost billions, destroyed thousands of jobs, and became a symbol of corporate fraud, ultimately leading to stricter regulations like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.",en,Tweet,3,34,6,8,6246,2024-12-02 12:23:30,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdyxmD3XYAAycq3.jpg

'1861742439079596242',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1924, the first Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade takes place in New York City. 

As the U.S. thrived during the Roaring Twenties, so did Macy's, the iconic New York department store. After going public in 1922, Macy’s expanded rapidly, acquiring competitors and opening new locations. In 1924, Macy's flagship store at Herald Square in Manhattan grew to occupy a full city block, and to mark its debut as ""The World’s Largest Store,"" Macy’s staged a parade on Thanksgiving morning to kick off the holiday shopping season. 

Though it took place on Thanksgiving, the parade was designed to promote Christmas shopping. Inspired by Philadelphia’s Gimbel Brothers’ 1920 parade, Macy’s event featured floats, clowns, animals from Central Park Zoo, and bands, with Santa Claus as the grand finale. 

The parade stretched over six miles, drew thousands of spectators. At its conclusion in front of Macy's, Santa Claus appeared, and the store's famous holiday window display was unveiled. Despite limited media coverage, the parade was so successful that Macy's announced it would be an annual event. Over time, the parade evolved into a major holiday tradition, replacing live animals with character balloons, such as Felix the Cat in 1927, which became the parade's signature feature. 

Today, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, shortened to 2.5 miles, still draws large crowds and marks the start of the Christmas season in New York.",en,Tweet,0,25,3,4,4139,2024-11-27 12:02:41,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdY84T3XAAAK3e3.jpg

The ""first"" Thanksgiving was held by the Pilgrims in 1621 at Plymouth, where they feasted to thank God for their harvest, inviting the Wampanoag tribe to join them. While this event was not repeated annually, similar observances occurred in other colonies and to celebrate victories in battle. In 1789, President George Washington proclaimed November 26 as a national day of thanksgiving to celebrate the creation of the United States and its new Constitution. Washington personally marked the day by attending church services and making charitable donations.

However, Washington’s proclamation did not establish Thanksgiving as a permanent federal holiday. Although other presidents, like John Adams and James Madison, issued thanksgiving proclamations, it did not become an annual observance until Abraham Lincoln’s presidency during the Civil War.",en,Tweet,4,53,8,7,3882,2024-11-26 12:31:09,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdT5ztdXMAAEhJR.jpg

'1861026157237293175',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1986, it is revealed that the United States had been secretly selling weapons to Iran and giving the funds to the Contras, an anti-communist group in Nicaragua, known as the Iran-Contra Affair. 

The original arms deal, first reported in early November, was meant to secure the release of seven American hostages in Lebanon but violated U.S. policies, including the arms embargo against Iran and President Reagan’s pledge not to negotiate with terrorists. A few weeks later, it was disclosed that the funds from these sales were used to support the Contras, which directly violated the 1982 Boland Amendment prohibiting U.S. aid for overthrowing Nicaragua's government.

In the wake of this revelation, President Reagan accepted responsibility for the arms-for-hostages deal but denied knowledge of the funds diversion. A special prosecutor was appointed to investigate, and televised hearings followed, finding that officials attempted to cover up their illegal actions. They concluded that while Reagan and Vice President George Bush didn’t break the law, their actions contributed to a broader effort to deceive Congress and the public.",en,Tweet,2,37,7,2,3505,2024-11-25 12:36:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdOxbMOWsAANW6-.jpg

The ship sank quickly, and Lim was one of the few survivors, managing to escape on a small life raft with little more than some biscuits, a few tins of water, and a flare gun. Stranded in the South Atlantic Ocean, Lim faced extreme challenges, including hunger, dehydration, and brutal exposure to the elements. Using his resourcefulness, he fashioned fishing tools from parts of the raft and caught fish with his bare hands. He also collected rainwater to stay hydrated and used the raft's canopy for shelter from the sun during the day. 

Over the course of his journey, he drifted more than 2,000 miles until he was rescued by a Brazilian fishing boat. By then, he had lost over 40 pounds.

While hunting sperm whales for their oil and bone, the 238-ton 𝐸𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑥 was rammed twice by an enraged bull whale, causing the ship to capsize. The 20 crew members escaped in three small boats, but only five survived the 83-day ordeal, ultimately rescued by other ships off South America. During their journey, the crew resorted to cannibalism, and at one point, men drew straws to decide who would be sacrificed for food. Three other men, left behind on a Pacific island, were later saved.

This battle, fought four months earlier, was one of the Civil War's bloodiest, with over 45,000 casualties. It marked a turning point in the war, as Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s defeat ended the Southern army's invasion of Northern territory.

The speech was just over 270 words, beginning with the phrase, “Four score and seven years ago.” Lincoln's famous conclusion emphasized the ongoing struggle for liberty: ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. … It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work … that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion … that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”",en,Tweet,7,66,11,4,9668,2024-11-19 12:15:29,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcvzFy_XcAAOpkt.jpg

'1858490361309515821',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1978, Jim Jones, leader of the Peoples Temple, led a mass murder-suicide at their remote commune in Jonestown, Guyana, resulting in 909 deaths, including a third who were children. 

Jones founded the Peoples Temple in the 1950s. Years later, the church faced accusations of financial fraud, abuse, and mistreatment of members. Facing increasing criticism, Jones moved his followers to Guyana , promising a utopian society. However, life in Jonestown was harsh, with members working long hours under strict control, including surveillance, forced confessions, and mock suicide drills. Jones, increasingly paranoid and addicted to drugs, believed the U.S. government was conspiring against him.

Former Temple members and concerned families convinced U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan to investigate Jonestown. The visit began peacefully, but several residents requested to leave. Jones became alarmed and ordered an ambush. Ryan and four others were killed as they attempted to leave the airstrip.

Back in Jonestown, Jones instructed followers to gather for what he called a ""revolutionary act."" Children were poisoned first, followed by adults, while armed guards prevented anyone from fleeing. The next day, authorities discovered hundreds of bodies at the commune, many grouped together. Some members had escaped into the jungle, and others survived because they were in a different part of Guyana at the time.",en,Tweet,2,36,3,10,6991,2024-11-18 12:40:05,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcqvIfKWUAEvno_.jpg

'1857755082474852751',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1974, researchers sent humanity’s first deliberate radio message into space, aimed at potential extraterrestrial life. 

The transmission, broadcast from Puerto Rico’s Arecibo Observatory, marked the completion of an upgrade to the facility's radio telescope. The message, created by astronomers Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, was directed at the M13 star cluster, located about 21,000 light years away. It contained a simple visual message, including the DNA formula, a diagram of the solar system, an image of the Arecibo telescope, and a stick figure of a human.

Though no response came, the researchers, including Cornell University’s Donald Campbell, were not expecting one. The transmission was more symbolic, demonstrating humanity’s technological capability. The Arecibo Observatory, which played a pivotal role in radio astronomy for six decades, tragically collapsed in 2020 due to structural failures.

'1857392514753241175',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1777, after 16 months of debate, the Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation. 

The Articles created a weak central government, reflecting the Patriots' fear of centralized power. Congress, a single house with one vote per state, could conduct foreign affairs, raise an army, and declare war, but lacked the power to tax. Amendments required unanimous approval from all states. Maryland's ratification in 1781 marked the Articles' official approval by all 13 states.

By 1787, the system was deemed inadequate, prompting the creation of a new constitution. A secret convention convened in Philadelphia to draft a new framework, leading to the U.S. Constitution in 1789, which replaced the Articles of Confederation. This shift marked a transition from rule by a king, to states' sovereignty, and finally to a unified people forming a federal government. This evolution encapsulated the American Revolution's transformation.",en,Tweet,6,90,24,4,4336,2024-11-15 11:57:38,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcbIpgKWcAArVf9.jpg

Over the course of the investigation, law enforcement uncovered key evidence, including DNA and surveillance footage, which led them to Bryan Kohberger, a 28-year-old criminology Ph.D. student at Washington State University, located about 10 miles away from the crime scene. Kohberger was arrested seven weeks later, in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, after an extensive manhunt. Authorities charged him with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary, alleging he had entered the victims' home with the intent to commit the murders.

The Gemini 12 mission, aimed at refining techniques for a lunar landing, involved Aldrin and James Lovell performing critical tasks like extravehicular activities (EVAs) and spacecraft docking.

During his spacewalk, Aldrin set up his camera on the hatch of the spacecraft, aiming it at himself and capturing a photo with Earth in the background. This marked the first self-portrait taken in space. Aldrin lifted his helmet visor to allow his face to appear in the shot, despite the challenges posed by the bulky spacesuit and zero-gravity environment.

This historic selfie was made possible by specialized space photography equipment, designed to withstand space's extreme conditions. Aldrin's achievement paved the way for future space selfies, with astronauts like Donald Pettit and Stephen Robinson continuing the trend in the 2000s.

'1855952978034737419',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1918, World War I ended when Germany, exhausted and on the brink of invasion, signed an armistice with the Allies in Compiégne, France.

The war’s roots trace back to June 28, 1914, when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb nationalist. This event escalated tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, with Austria-Hungary blaming the Serbian government for the attack. Russia, allied with Serbia, mobilized its forces, prompting Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. The conflict quickly spread as Germany supported Austria-Hungary, while France and Russia aligned against them. Germany's invasion of Belgium led to Britain declaring war on Germany.

The war, initially expected to be short, devolved into a brutal stalemate, especially on the Western Front, where trench warfare caused massive casualties. In 1915, the Allies tried to break the deadlock with a failed invasion of Turkey. By 1916, heavy offensives on the Western Front achieved no decisive results, though Germany had more success in the east, leading to a collapse of the Russian army and the Russian Revolution of 1917. By the end of 1917, the Bolsheviks had taken power and negotiated peace with Germany.

In 1918, the entry of American troops and resources tipped the balance in favor of the Allies. Germany, facing defeat, signed an armistice on November 11. The war, known as the “war to end all wars,” caused unimaginable destruction, resulting in about 9 million military deaths, 21 million wounded, and at least 5 million civilian casualties due to disease, starvation, and exposure. However, the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 imposed harsh terms on Germany, sowing the seeds for future conflict and leading to World War II.",en,Tweet,0,55,8,12,11452,2024-11-11 12:37:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcGrZMAW0AE5ih_.jpg

'1855229810491990524',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1989, East German officials opened the Berlin Wall, allowing free travel between East and West Berlin. The next day, jubilant crowds began tearing the wall down. 

This marked the collapse of one of the Cold War's most infamous symbols, as the wall's destruction was quickly followed by souvenir hunters collecting pieces of rubble. The decision to open the wall was influenced by Hungary's recent move to open its border with Austria, allowing East Germans to bypass the Berlin Wall entirely and escape to the West. 

The fall of the wall also reflected broader political shifts in East Germany, where the communist regime was losing power and calls for democratic reforms grew louder. The event had a significant impact on U.S. President George Bush and his advisors, who, after watching the celebrations on television, grew more convinced that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s reformist stance was genuine. Unlike past Soviet crackdowns in Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968), Gorbachev supported the changes in East Germany, signaling a shift in Soviet policy.

'1854864977145868726',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1895, physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovered X-rays while experimenting with cathode rays in his lab in Germany. 

Noticing a glow from a nearby screen, he identified the unknown rays and named them X-rays. These electromagnetic waves, much shorter than visible light, could penetrate soft tissue but were blocked by denser materials like bone. Röntgen's discovery revolutionized medicine by allowing doctors to view the inside of the human body without surgery. X-rays were first used in military medicine during the Balkan War of 1897 to locate bullets and fractures.

Though initially seen as harmless, the dangers of X-ray radiation became apparent in the early 1900s after reports of burns and skin damage, and the death of Thomas Edison's assistant from cancer. Despite these risks, X-rays were used in various consumer products, like shoe-fitting fluoroscopes, until the 1950s, when their dangers were better understood. Röntgen, who received the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery, never patented X-rays. Today, X-ray technology is widely used in medicine, security, and materials testing.",en,Tweet,0,36,2,4,10075,2024-11-08 12:34:06,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gb3N3X_XgAAvD-n.jpg

'1854494586904686767',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 2000, the U.S. presidential election was ruled inconclusive as only 537 votes in Florida separated Al Gore and George W. Bush.

The election was a tumultuous process, starting with confusion on election night as networks first declared Florida for Gore, then for Bush, and back again, before Gore retracted his concession.

Despite Gore winning the popular vote by over 500,000 votes, the Electoral College ultimately decided the outcome. The recounts and legal challenges in Florida became a national spectacle, with terms like ""hanging chads"" and ""dimpled chads"" becoming widely recognized. The controversial butterfly ballot design in Florida, which led to misvotes, compounded the problem.

The recount process was marred by inconsistent standards and legal battles, culminating in a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court ruled 7-2 that the recount violated constitutional standards for consistency, and by a 5-4 vote, stopped the recount due to time constraints, effectively awarding Florida—and thus the presidency—to Bush.

The ruling, which divided along ideological lines, remains one of the most controversial in American history.

'1853767391316000779',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1940, Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to an unprecedented third term as President of the United States, becoming the first U.S. president in history to win more than two terms in office. 

Roosevelt, who had already served as president for nearly eight years, defeated his Republican opponent by a wide margin, securing 84.5% of the electoral vote. His victory reflected the continued public support for his leadership during one of the most challenging periods in American history.

FDR's presidency was marked by bold and transformative actions aimed at addressing the Great Depression and guiding the nation through the early years of World War II. Under his New Deal programs, Roosevelt introduced groundbreaking economic reforms, including Social Security, labor rights protections, and public works projects, which sought to provide relief, recovery, and reform to a country devastated by economic collapse.

As he campaigned for his third term in 1940, Roosevelt was also faced with the growing threat of global conflict. World War II was already raging in Europe, and Roosevelt had begun to prepare the U.S. for its eventual involvement, despite widespread isolationist sentiment at home.

Roosevelt's third term would prove to be pivotal, as the United States officially entered World War II in December 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt's leadership during the war would shape not only the future of the United States but also the world order in the post-war era.

FDR's election for a third term marked a significant moment in U.S. history, signaling the nation's confidence in his ability to navigate turbulent times. His continued presidency, however, also sparked debates about presidential term limits, leading to the eventual passage of the 22nd Amendment in 1951, which formally restricted U.S. presidents to two terms in office.",en,Tweet,0,28,0,9,4740,2024-11-05 11:52:42,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gbnnnd1XgAAVdoO.jpg

'1853407131778818450',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1979, the Iran Hostage Crisis begins when students loyal to Ayatollah Khomeini, an Iranian religious leader, stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran, taking 90 hostages in a dramatic act of protest. 

Their anger stemmed from the U.S. allowing the deposed Shah, who had been overthrown in Iran's 1979 revolution, to enter the country for medical treatment. The students, part of a radical Islamic movement, threatened to kill hostages if any rescue attempts were made, escalating tensions between Iran and the United States.

In the wake of the takeover, Khomeini solidified his power, and after a brief period, the students began releasing non-American hostages, along with women and minorities, whom Khomeini described as oppressed by American society. However, 52 American diplomats and embassy staff remained captives for 14 months as President Jimmy Carter struggled to resolve the crisis through diplomacy. 

Carter's inability to secure a resolution was compounded by a failed military rescue mission in April 1980, which resulted in the deaths of eight U.S. servicemen. This debacle further eroded public confidence in his leadership and severely impacted his reelection campaign. 

After months of tense negotiations, a deal was finally reached, and the hostages were released on January 20, 1981, just minutes after Reagan took office, illustrating the enduring animosity towards Carter.",en,Tweet,1,35,9,8,2828,2024-11-04 12:01:09,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gbif9nSXsAAzFpa.jpg

'1852669281915298051',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1847, The Hughes Flying Boat, also known as the ""Spruce Goose,"" flies for the first and last time. 

Howard Hughes, a successful Hollywood producer, founded the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1932 and made several aviation records, including a transcontinental flight in 1937 and a round-the-world trip in 1938. After the U.S. entered World War II, Hughes was commissioned to develop the H-4 flying boat. Originally conceived by Henry Kaiser, the project fell to Hughes due to Kaiser’s withdrawal. With steel in short supply, the aircraft was primarily made of wood, which led to its nickname. It was intended to transport over 700 troops.

The development cost $23 million and took so long that the war ended before its completion in 1946. Critics questioned its viability, prompting Congress to require a demonstration of airworthiness. Hughes surprised thousands of spectators by flying the Spruce Goose for a mile over Long Beach Harbor.

Despite this successful flight, the Spruce Goose never entered production due to concerns about its wooden structure. After becoming increasingly reclusive, Hughes maintained the aircraft in a climate-controlled hangar until his death in 1976. The Spruce Goose is now displayed at the Evergreen Aviation Museum in McMinnville, Oregon.",en,Tweet,1,19,5,6,2387,2024-11-02 11:09:12,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbYA5HqW0AAdvp6.jpg

'1852303430330519790',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1955, a bomb aboard United Airlines Flight 629 kills 44 people. 

The flight took off from Denver, bound for Portland. Just 11 minutes into the flight, the plane crashed near Longmont, killing all 39 passengers and five crew members. Initial investigations revealed signs of an explosion; wreckage analysis showed damage to the fuselage, and eyewitnesses reported seeing fireballs in the sky and on the ground.

As the investigation progressed, it became clear that the crash was not due to mechanical failure or pilot error. The FBI was called in to pursue a criminal investigation. A crucial lead emerged when investigators found that passenger Daisie E. King had been carrying newspaper clippings concerning her son, Jack Gilbert Graham, who had a criminal history involving forgery and was on a local most-wanted list. Notably, Graham was the beneficiary of at least $37,500 in life insurance policies on his mother, and there were reports of strained relations between them.

As the investigation deepened, FBI agents discovered detonating wire at Graham's residence. This prompted further interrogation, during which Graham confessed to his heinous act: he had constructed a homemade bomb using 25 sticks of dynamite, hidden it in his mother’s luggage, and set it to explode after a timed delay, having purchased a 60-minute timing device shortly before the flight.

Graham's motives were rooted in financial gain; in addition to the life insurance policies, he stood to inherit a significant sum upon his mother's death. Testimonies revealed frequent arguments between them, supporting the notion of a strained relationship leading to Graham's desperate act.

Ultimately, he was found guilty and sentenced to death, with his execution taking place in January 1957.

One lingering question about the case was why Graham was only charged with the murder of his mother despite the loss of 44 lives. Legal experts noted that this strategy was likely the most straightforward route to secure a death penalty conviction, as specific laws governing airline bombings had yet to be established.",en,Tweet,1,19,4,3,2459,2024-11-01 10:55:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbS0Js_XAAA3gjk.jpg

'1851955105039278379',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 100 BC, the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, celebrated on to mark the end of the harvest and the onset of winter, began. 

The Celts, who lived in what is now Ireland, the UK, and northern France, believed this night blurred the line between the living and the dead. They lit bonfires, wore costumes, and performed rituals to ward off spirits and seek guidance from Druids, the Celtic priests.

In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III established November 1 as All Saints Day, which integrated elements of Samhain, leading to the evening before being known as All Hallows Eve, or Halloween. By the 9th century, as Christianity spread, it further absorbed Celtic traditions, and November 2 became All Souls’ Day, honoring the dead in ways similar to Samhain.

While Halloween celebrations were limited in Puritan New England due to strict religious beliefs, they thrived in southern colonies where communal harvest celebrations emerged. With the arrival of Irish immigrants in the late 19th century, Halloween gained national popularity. These immigrants brought customs like dressing in costumes, where children went door-to-door asking for food, evolving into the modern trick-or-treating tradition.

By the late 1800s, there was a concerted effort in America to reshape Halloween into a community-focused holiday, emphasizing neighborly gatherings over its darker roots. This led to the rise of Halloween parties, featuring games, seasonal foods, and festive costumes. Newspapers and community leaders advocated for removing frightening elements, resulting in a Halloween that lost much of its superstitious and religious connotations by the early 20th century, focusing instead on fun and community spirit.",en,Tweet,2,29,4,4,2399,2024-10-31 11:51:19,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbN3WjCW8AA2oGt.jpg

Seven years earlier, Ali had lost his title due to draft evasion charges. This victory made him the second boxer in history to reclaim the title after losing it.

The match was Africa's first heavyweight championship fight and aimed to showcase the country's beauty and resources, with Zaire's president paying each fighter $5 million.

During the match, Foreman initially dominated with powerful punches, but Ali employed a defensive strategy known as ""rope-a-dope,"" absorbing blows until Foreman tired. In the eighth round, Ali launched a flurry of punches, knocking Foreman down with just two seconds left in the round.

Following this victory, Ali held the heavyweight title until his retirement in 1981 and passed away in 2016. Foreman, who retired in 1977, made a remarkable comeback in 1987, becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in boxing history at age 45.

Glenn was a decorated U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant colonel and one of NASA's first astronauts selected in 1959. He had a distinguished military career, flying nearly 150 combat missions and making the first nonstop supersonic flight across the U.S. in 1957.

Following Yuri Gagarin's historic flight in 1961, Glenn's Friendship 7 mission made him a national hero as it orbited the Earth three times. He was celebrated with a visit from President Kennedy and a ticker-tape parade.

After his historic flight, Glenn was largely sidelined by NASA due to concerns for his safety. He turned to politics, running for the U.S. Senate from Ohio, but withdrew due to an injury. He eventually won a Senate seat and was re-elected three times, serving until his retirement in 1999.

'1850862766602518679',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1919, Congress passed the Volstead Act, overriding President Wilson's veto, to enforce the 18th Amendment, which established Prohibition. 

The push for alcohol prohibition began in the early 19th century with temperance societies, gaining momentum by the late 19th century as these groups became politically influential. The 18th Amendment was ratified in January 1919, making it illegal to manufacture, sell, or transport intoxicating liquors.

The Volstead Act, enacted later that year, aimed to enforce these laws, including forming a special Treasury unit. However, it struggled to curb the illegal alcohol trade, leading to a rise in organized crime. Figures like Al Capone became notorious during this time, illustrating how organized crime thrived in response to the ban on alcohol.

The era also saw the rise of speakeasies—illegal bars that became popular social hubs. Ultimately, Prohibition was repealed in 1933 by the 21st Amendment.",en,Tweet,0,17,3,4,2488,2024-10-28 11:30:45,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ga-V4FkX0AAk96c.jpg

'1850140012853039341',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1881, the Earp brothers confronted the Clanton-McLaury gang in the most famous Wild West shootout at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona. 

Tombstone had rapidly developed into a wealthy mining town after silver was discovered nearby in 1877. Wyatt Earp, a former police officer, and his brothers, Morgan and Virgil (the town marshal), embodied law enforcement but were also seen as ruthless. The Clantons and McLaurys were cowboys involved in cattle rustling and criminal activities. Tensions between these groups escalated, leading to the deadly confrontation at the O.K. Corral.

The day prior, Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury arrived in Tombstone for supplies and quickly clashed with the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday. The following afternoon, Ike's brother Billy, along with Frank McLaury and Billy Claiborne, joined them. At a local saloon, they learned from Holliday that their brothers had been pistol-whipped by the Earps, prompting Frank and Billy to seek revenge.

By 3 p.m., the Earps and Holliday encountered the Clanton-McLaury gang in a vacant lot near the O.K. Corral. The ensuing gunfight lasted about 30 seconds, with around 30 shots fired. Most accounts suggest that Virgil Earp fired the first shot, hitting Billy Clanton, while Doc Holliday shot Tom McLaury. Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton also returned fire but were both fatally wounded. Ike Clanton and Claiborne fled the scene.

Sheriff John Behan charged the Earps and Holliday with murder, but a month later, a judge found them not guilty, stating they were justified in their actions. The shootout has since been depicted in numerous films, including 𝐹𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑟 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑙 and 𝑇𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒.",en,Tweet,1,29,7,5,2770,2024-10-26 12:38:47,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ga0EiLMa4AANrd_.jpg

'1849411886854369758',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1929, known as Black Thursday, the U.S. stock market experienced a dramatic decline, marking the beginning of a catastrophic financial crisis that contributed to the Great Depression. 

This event followed a period of significant economic optimism during the Roaring Twenties, characterized by rising stock prices and rampant speculation. The crisis began on October 23, when stock prices fell 4.6%, leading to widespread panic among investors. On Black Thursday, an unprecedented 12.9 million shares were traded, far exceeding previous records. This surge overwhelmed stockbrokers, causing delays and inaccuracies in trade reports, which intensified the sense of chaos. In response to the turmoil, police were dispatched to the New York Stock Exchange to maintain order, while Wall Street executives attempted to reassure the public.

Leading up to the crash, many stocks were purchased on margin, meaning investors borrowed money to buy shares, which left them vulnerable to sudden price drops. While some economists had raised alarms about the market's sustainability, many investors remained hopeful, believing prices would continue to rise.

In a bid to stabilize the market, major banks and investment firms intervened by purchasing large blocks of stocks. Initially, this action seemed to quell the panic, as the market closed only slightly down for the day. However, the temporary boost did little to restore confidence. On the following days, known as Black Monday and Black Tuesday, stock prices plummeted further.

The aftermath of Black Thursday triggered a ripple effect across the economy, contributing to decreased manufacturing and rising unemployment. While the crash was a pivotal moment, economists continue to debate whether it was a direct cause of the Great Depression or a symptom of underlying economic weaknesses.",en,Tweet,0,25,6,9,2150,2024-10-24 12:25:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GapuT0aWcAAxtAE.jpg

Malet, who had previously been a loyal supporter of Napoleon, became disillusioned with the Emperor's leadership and the ongoing military disasters. The conspiracy revolved around spreading the false news of Napoleon's death, which Malet believed would destabilize the government and create an opportunity for his faction to seize power. His plan involved securing key locations in Paris and arresting high-ranking officials. Malet and his co-conspirators successfully took control of the Prefecture of Police and managed to capture several important figures, including the Minister of Police.

Malet’s group declared that a new government had been formed, with promises of restoring peace and stability. However, their deception quickly unraveled. Some officials, suspicious of the claims, began to investigate, and loyalist forces rallied to counter the coup. 

The situation escalated when loyal troops were dispatched to retake control. Within a matter of hours, the conspiracy fell apart. Malet was arrested, and the other conspirators were either captured or fled.

'1848684577801248903',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1934, Charles “Pretty Boy” Floyd’s funeral drew tens of thousands of mourners, reflecting his status as one of the country's most beloved bank robbers. 

Floyd had been designated Public Enemy No. 1 due to his alleged involvement in the Kansas City Massacre, where three policemen and an FBI agent were shot during a chaotic attempt to capture an escaped federal prisoner.

His criminal career began at a young age, starting with a $350 post-office robbery when he was just 18. After a three-year stint in the St. Louis underworld, he landed in Missouri Penitentiary for a payroll robbery, After his release, he partnered with “Red” Lovett and spent the next four years robbing rural banks, often changing partners as they fell victim to violence or capture.

Public perception of Floyd diverged sharply from the FBI’s portrayal. While the agency labeled him a ruthless killer—TIME magazine described him as “a murderously cool shot” responsible for at least six deaths—many saw him as a tragic figure, a poor Oklahoma tenant farmer turned outlaw due to financial desperation. Rumors suggested he destroyed mortgage notes during his bank heists, helping struggling farmers escape foreclosure. He had a reputation of generosity, supporting families in hiding from the law, providing food and aid to those in need.

Despite his attempts to evade capture, Floyd's life came to a dramatic end in Ohio, where he crashed his getaway car.

The USS Constitution, known as Old Ironsides, is a historic three-masted wooden frigate of the U.S. Navy and the oldest commissioned naval warship still afloat. Launched in 1797, she was one of six frigates built under the Naval Act of 1794 to serve as a capital ship for the young Navy. Constructed in a Boston shipyard, her early missions included protecting American merchant ships during the Quasi-War with France and combating Barbary pirates.

Most famous for her role in the War of 1812, the Constitution captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five British warships, earning her the nickname ""Old Ironsides."" After the war, she served in various capacities, including as a flagship in the Mediterranean and as a training ship during the Civil War. Notably, she circled the globe in the 1840s.

Retired from active duty in 1881, the Constitution became a museum ship in 1907. She completed a national tour in 1934 and sailed under her own power for her bicentennial in 1997 and again in 2012 to commemorate her victory over the Guerriere.

Today, the Constitution's mission is to educate the public about the Navy's role in history through outreach, demonstrations, and participation in events.

'1847238588414492993',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1867, the U.S. officially acquired Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million, equivalent to less than two cents per acre. 

The territory, inhabited by Indigenous peoples for thousands of years, spanned 586,412 square miles—about twice the size of Texas—and was promoted by Secretary of State William Henry Seward.

Russia sought to sell the remote territory to avoid losing it in a potential conflict with Great Britain. Despite public skepticism, which led to derisive names like “Seward’s Folly,” negotiations between Seward and Russian minister Eduard de Stoeckl began in March 1867. Public disapproval was partly fueled by President Andrew Johnson's unpopularity, especially following his impeachment in 1868. Ultimately, Congress approved the purchase.

Alaska was under U.S. Army control until June 1877, after which it was briefly governed by the Treasury Department and various military authorities. Most Russians in the territory returned to Russia after the sale, and those who stayed had the option to apply for U.S. citizenship within three years, though most eventually departed. A civil government was established in May 1884 when Alaska became a district.

Public sentiment shifted positively after gold was discovered in Nome, Alaska, in 1899, igniting a gold rush. Alaska became the 49th state on January 3, 1959, and is now known for its rich natural resources, supplying a significant portion of the U.S. oil and seafood.",en,Tweet,3,24,7,4,2697,2024-10-18 12:29:34,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaK1tJIWUAAPt9g.jpg

'1846902415502586262',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1978, President Jimmy Carter officially restores the full citizenship rights of Jefferson Davis, the former president of the Confederacy, effectively resolving a century-long debate. 

Davis is primarily remembered alongside General Robert E. Lee, who had his citizenship restored by Congress in 1976. The congressional resolution acknowledged Davis's significant contributions, noting his service as a soldier, U.S. Congressman, and Secretary of War. It stated that restoring his citizenship completed the reconciliation process that followed the Civil War, emphasizing the need to reunite the nation after its divisive conflict.

Davis's path to citizenship restoration was complicated by the 14th Amendment, which barred former Confederates from holding public office unless Congress intervened. Although he was indicted for treason after the war, the charges were ultimately dismissed when President Andrew Johnson issued a general pardon in 1868. This pardon restored civil rights but did not grant the right to hold office.

In the 1870s, discussions arose about potentially allowing Davis to run for Senate, but he was specifically excluded from an 1876 universal amnesty bill that restored citizenship rights to most former Confederates. Davis’s refusal to seek a pardon was rooted in his belief that he had not acted wrongfully, famously stating, “repentance must precede the right of pardon.”

Before his leadership in the Confederacy, Davis was a highly respected U.S. senator from Mississippi. His resignation speech in 1861, delivered as Mississippi prepared to secede, was a dramatic moment in the lead-up to the Civil War. In it, he expressed hope for peaceful relations while asserting the right to leave the Union, evoking strong emotions among his colleagues.

The restoration of Davis's citizenship by Carter not only acknowledged his historical role but also highlighted the ongoing complexities of reconciling the legacies of the Civil War and its leaders in American history.",en,Tweet,3,52,5,11,3644,2024-10-17 14:13:44,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaGD9REWEAA12d4.jpg

'1846526862035398954',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis begins, marking a critical confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, bringing the two superpowers closest to nuclear war during the Cold War. 

Following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev secretly arranged to place nuclear missiles in Cuba to deter future attacks. U.S. surveillance revealed the missile sites in October, prompting President Kennedy to convene his advisers.

Kennedy decided on a naval ""quarantine"" of Cuba, publicly warning that any missile launched from Cuba would be treated as an attack by the Soviet Union. As tensions escalated, U.S. forces were placed on high alert. A few weeks later, a potential diplomatic solution emerged when a Soviet agent proposed removing missiles in exchange for a U.S. non-invasion promise. However, Khrushchev later insisted that the U.S. remove its missiles from Turkey.

Amid increasing tensions, including the shooting down of a U-2 jet, Kennedy chose to respond to the initial Soviet message, proposing a supervised removal of missiles from Cuba. This was coupled with a secret indication of U.S. plans to remove missiles from Turkey. On October 28, Khrushchev announced the dismantling of Soviet missiles in Cuba, effectively ending the crisis.

The crisis not only bolstered Kennedy's standing but also highlighted communication failures between the two nations, leading to the establishment of a direct communication line known as the ""Hotline"" and a reconsideration of nuclear arms policies, paving the way for future arms control agreements.",en,Tweet,2,14,3,2,1746,2024-10-16 13:21:25,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaAuZOXWAAADv6r.jpg

Following the retirement of Thurgood Marshall in July 1991, President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas, a conservative African American judge. Despite initially facing little opposition, the hearings took a dramatic turn when he was accused of sexual harassment. The televised hearings revealed a stark divide, the testimony met by skepticism from the committee, and Thomas denied the allegations. 

Ultimately, the Senate confirmed Thomas, marking a significant shift toward conservatism in the Supreme Court.

'1845801358986785088',"On this day in 1982, President Ronald Reagan declared illicit drugs a significant threat to U.S. national security. 

The phrase ""war on drugs"" was initially popularized by Richard Nixon in 1971, but the origins of drug policy in the U.S. can be traced back to the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914 and the establishment of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in 1930, reflecting a long history of drug regulation.

In a speech at the Justice Department, Reagan likened his administration’s commitment to combating drug use and trafficking to the determination shown by the French army during the Battle of Verdun in World War I, stressing that challenges could be overcome with resolve. He quoted a French soldier, asserting, “There are no impossible situations. There are only people who think they’re impossible.”

First Lady Nancy Reagan played a crucial role in spreading the anti-drug message, actively touring elementary schools to educate children about the dangers of drug use. During one visit, when a fourth grader at Longfellow Elementary School in Oakland, California, asked how to respond if offered drugs, she famously replied, “Just say no,” making the phrase a cultural touchstone.

In 1988, Reagan established the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to coordinate drug-related initiatives across various government sectors, including legislation, security, and health policy. The media dubbed its directors “drug czars,” reflecting the growing focus on a centralized approach to drug control. In 1993, President Bill Clinton elevated the position to Cabinet-level status, highlighting the ongoing commitment to addressing drug issues at the highest levels of government.

Reagan’s efforts marked a significant escalation in the War on Drugs, leading to increased funding for drug enforcement and harsher penalties for drug offenses, which contributed to a dramatic rise in incarceration rates for nonviolent drug crimes. This intensified focus on drug policy would have lasting implications for law enforcement and communities across the nation.",en,Tweet,1,25,7,33,9952,2024-10-14 13:18:31,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZ2ajYCXAAsDdHG.jpg

'1845069507502469431',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 2000, the USS Cole is attacked by terrorists. 

At 12:15 p.m. local time, a motorized rubber dinghy loaded with explosives detonated against the USS Cole, a U.S. Navy destroyer refueling in Aden, Yemen. The blast created a 40-by-40-foot hole in the ship's port side, resulting in the deaths of 17 sailors and injuries to 38 others. The attack was executed by two suicide bombers affiliated with al Qaeda, the terrorist network led by Osama bin Laden.

The USS Cole had stopped in Aden to refuel for only four hours, indicating that the attackers had precise and prior knowledge of its unannounced visit. The dinghy managed to blend in with other harbor vessels assisting the Cole during its mooring, allowing the terrorists to approach the warship without raising suspicion. As the dinghy reached the destroyer, it exploded, causing extensive damage to the engine room, mess area, and living quarters.

Witnesses aboard the Cole reported that both attackers stood up just before the explosion, indicating their intention to carry out the deadly mission. This incident marked one of the deadliest attacks against a U.S. naval vessel in recent history and highlighted vulnerabilities in maritime security at foreign ports, prompting significant changes in U.S. naval protocols and counterterrorism efforts in the region. The attack ultimately underscored the growing threat posed by al Qaeda and set the stage for increased tensions between the U.S. and extremist groups in the Middle East.",en,Tweet,0,23,8,3,2162,2024-10-12 12:50:24,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZsA79JWIAQRfQo.jpg

'1844698516536410547',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1992, Deion Sanders attempted to make sports history by playing in both the NFL and MLB on the same day. 

“Prime Time” began his day with the Atlanta Falcons facing the Miami Dolphins at the Orange Bowl, where they lost 21-17. In that game, Sanders showcased his versatility by returning two kicks, a punt, and catching a nine-yard pass, all while contributing to a defense tasked with containing the legendary Dan Marino.

Immediately after the game, Sanders flew to Pittsburgh for Game 5 of the 1992 NLCS with the Atlanta Braves. He arrived still in his Falcons gear, unprepared for the 53-degree weather. Although he did not see any action in the Braves' 7-1 defeat to the Pirates, his mere presence was historic; had he played, he would have been the first athlete to compete in two major American professional sports on the same day.

A week later, Sanders had another opportunity to make history, with the Falcons facing the 49ers and the Braves hosting the Blue Jays for Game 2 of the World Series. However, he opted to remain in Atlanta, starting in left field. He recorded one hit and two walks in a closely contested 5-4 loss to the Blue Jays.

'1844340427241013480',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1780, one of the deadliest hurricanes kills more than 20,000 people. 

The Great Hurricane of 1780 was an extraordinarily destructive storm that struck the Caribbean. Its precise origin and strength remain uncertain due to the absence of modern storm-tracking technology at the time. 

The hurricane is believed to have first made landfall in Barbados, subsequently ravaging other parts of the eastern Caribbean over the following week. The islands of Barbados, Martinique, and St. Lucia were particularly hard hit, suffering thousands of casualties and widespread destruction of property. 

During this period, both Great Britain and France were engaged in the American Revolutionary War, and numerous naval vessels from both nations were present in the Caribbean. Many of these ships were lost to the storm, further complicating wartime efforts.

Despite numerous deadly hurricanes since 1780, only Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which resulted in over 11,000 deaths in Central America, has come close to the catastrophic toll of the Great Hurricane.",en,Tweet,2,20,5,1,2228,2024-10-10 12:33:18,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZhp18RWAAASYvB.jpg

'1843968365599072445',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1936, the Hoover Dam began transmitting electricity generated by the Colorado River across 266 miles to power Los Angeles. 

Originally named Boulder Dam, construction commenced under President Hoover's administration but was completed during Roosevelt's presidency, which ultimately renamed it in Hoover's honor. When finished in 1935, the dam stood as the tallest in the world and became a powerful symbol of the federal government's commitment to large-scale reclamation projects aimed at transforming the arid West.

While the generation of electricity was a significant benefit, the primary purpose of Hoover Dam was to manage the precious water resources of the region. Under the direction of the Federal Reclamation Bureau, the dam played a crucial role in controlling the Colorado River, which had previously flowed freely to the ocean. This management led to the creation of Lake Mead, a 115-mile-long reservoir, and a network of massive aqueducts that transported millions of gallons of water to California, benefiting urban areas and vast agricultural regions.

Hoover Dam represented an ambitious vision: to demonstrate that the harsh conditions of what was once known as the Great American Desert need not impede settlement and development.",en,Tweet,1,24,4,8,3301,2024-10-09 11:54:52,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZcXdIIW8AEIAC4.jpg

'1843626274075341154',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1962, North Korea held parliamentary elections for the 3rd Supreme People's Assembly, where voter turnout was reported at a remarkable 100%, with all votes cast in favor of the candidates.

In North Korea, voting is mandatory, and there is no opportunity for dissent. All citizens aged 17 and older must participate, often facing pressure to show loyalty by arriving early and joining lengthy queues. The voting process involves receiving a ballot with a single name, which voters drop into a publicly visible ballot box. Although there is a private voting booth available, using it could lead to suspicion from authorities.

Once voters leave the polling station, they are expected to join cheering groups outside, publicly expressing enthusiasm for the leadership. State media portray election days as festive occasions, with celebrations surrounding polling stations. In addition to serving as a mechanism for political control, these elections also function as a census, enabling authorities to monitor the population in each constituency and track any potential defectors fleeing to China.

Overall, North Korea's electoral process reflects the regime's strict control over political life, ensuring total compliance and the appearance of unanimous support for the ruling Kim family dynasty.",en,Tweet,0,11,4,6,2840,2024-10-08 13:15:31,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZXgU1BWcAAKYym.jpg

Coached by John Heisman—after whom the Heisman Trophy is named—Georgia Tech surged to a 63-0 lead in the first quarter at Grant Field in Atlanta. Heisman opted to shorten the quarters to 12 minutes, yet speculation arose that he ran up the score as revenge for Cumberland allegedly using professional players to defeat Georgia Tech in baseball.

Cumberland player Ed Haysler Poague later remarked that while his team wasn't bad, they were “so ridiculously outclassed that day that it was, well, ridiculous.” Fans quickly realized the game wouldn't be competitive, leading to laughter in the stands. The Atlanta Constitution noted that “all of Cumberland's plays were smothered completely.” Despite leading 126-0 at halftime, Heisman urged his players to maintain their intensity in the second half, stating, “You never know what those Cumberland players have up their sleeve.”",en,Tweet,0,26,7,8,4222,2024-10-07 13:43:33,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZSdJz_WUAANEfD.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZSdJz-WcAAzOO3.jpg"

'1842520435121950887',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1962, 𝐷𝑟. 𝑁𝑜, the inaugural film in the James Bond series featuring Sean Connery, premieres in London. 

Directed by Terence Young and based on the novel by Ian Fleming, the plot centers on Bond's mission to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent in Jamaica, leading him to the secretive lair of Dr. Julius No, who is devising a plot to disrupt an American space launch using a radio beam weapon.

𝐷𝑟. 𝑁𝑜 was made on a low budget but became a financial success, paving the way for future installments. While it received mixed reviews upon release, it has since earned a reputation as one of the best films in the series. Notably, it introduced significant elements that became trademarks of the Bond franchise, including the distinctive gun barrel opening sequence, the stylized title sequence, and the iconic theme music.

The film also set the stage for the visual style of the series with elaborate sets that enhanced the storytelling. Additionally, 𝐷𝑟. 𝑁𝑜 incorporated references to earlier and later works in Fleming's series, including the criminal organization SPECTRE, which would play a prominent role in subsequent films.

The film's success led to a flourishing genre of secret agent films in the 1960s, as well as adaptations like comic books and soundtrack albums, further solidifying its cultural impact. Following 𝐷𝑟. 𝑁𝑜, the next film in the series, 𝐹𝑟𝑜𝑚 𝑅𝑢𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑎 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝐿𝑜𝑣𝑒, was released in 1963, continuing the legacy of James Bond in cinema.",en,Tweet,1,36,8,11,6540,2024-10-05 12:01:18,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZHykffWMAAEZJE.jpg

'1842178436179128602',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1957, the Space Age begins with the launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, by the Soviet Union. 

The satellite launched from the Tyuratam launch base in Kazakhstan. Weighing 184 pounds and measuring 22 inches in diameter, Sputnik orbited Earth every hour and 36 minutes at a speed of 18,000 miles per hour. It transmitted radio signals that could be received by amateur radio operators in the U.S., sparking both fascination and concern over Soviet technological advancements.

Launched to coincide with the International Geophysical Year, Sputnik’s success prompted fears in the U.S. about potential military applications of Soviet rocket technology, especially as it was significantly larger than the planned U.S. satellite, Explorer, which launched in January of 1958. The launch of Sputnik marked the beginning of the space race, as the U.S. government and military scrambled to catch up.

In the following years, the Soviet Union achieved several space milestones, including the first living being in orbit, the first human in space, and numerous other firsts.

'1841801349773541874',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1990, East and West Germany celebrate “Unity Day” less than a year after the Berlin Wall's fall, marking their reunification after being separated for 45 years. 

Since 1945, Germany had been divided into an eastern Communist zone and a western Allied-controlled zone, symbolizing the Cold War's tensions. Key events, like the Berlin Blockade (1948-1949) and the wall's construction in 1961, highlighted this division. As Soviet power declined in the late 1980s, the East German Communist Party weakened, leading to mass emigration and the wall's eventual dismantling in late 1989. Reunification talks followed, involving officials from both German states and major Allied powers. Just two months later, Germany held its first all-German elections, resulting in Helmut Kohl becoming the first chancellor of a reunified nation. 

Although the Soviet Union would not dissolve for over a year, many viewed Germany's reunification as a pivotal moment signaling the Cold War's end.",en,Tweet,1,27,7,12,9617,2024-10-03 12:23:55,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY9kkLhWAAAnRQQ.jpg

He purchased $1,600 of used restaurant equipment, set up in a broom closet at his father's bar, and began making pizza. The idea originated when he was 15 years old working at Rocky's pizza place as a dishwasher, where he learned the importance of quality pizza and noticed a market gap in delivery from local shops. 

After graduating from college, he sold his beloved Camaro to stabilize his father’s bar, then opened his first pizza location next to it. 

An immediate success, Schnatter exceeded initial expectations, with sales reaching $9,000 a week compared to $6,000 for national chains. He opted for franchising, inspired by the rapid expansion of brands like KFC, leading to thousands of Papa John's locations that exist today.

Renowned for its natural wonders like Half Dome and giant sequoias, this achievement was largely driven by environmental advocate John Muir and others, with support from President Benjamin Harrison. 

The park's creation followed a history of Native American habitation disrupted by the 1849 gold rush, which led to ecological damage and increased tourism. President Abraham Lincoln designated Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove as a public trust to protect them from exploitation, laying the groundwork for future national parks.

Muir and fellow advocate Robert Underwood Johnson pushed for national park status to protect the meadows around Yosemite from overgrazing by sheep. Their efforts resulted in the designation of over 1,500 square miles as Yosemite National Park, the third national park in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction eventually extended to Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. Ansel Adams later captured the park's beauty through iconic black-and-white photographs.

'1840723660992127287',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1982, the Tylenol scare began when seven Chicago residents died over the course of a few days after taking cyanide-laced extra-strength Tylenol capsules. 

After initial investigations of the deaths of the victims, doctors determined cyanide contamination, leading Johnson & Johnson to issue a historic recall of 31 million bottles. The cyanide had not originated in the company's facilities; rather, someone had likely tampered with the bottles after purchasing them.

Police used bullhorns throughout the streets of Chicago to urge residents to dispose of any Tylenol in their homes. Public health officials distributed flyers, and stores removed all Tylenol products from their shelves.

James Lewis, who claimed to be the Tylenol killer, sent a letter to Johnson & Johnson demanding $1 million to stop the poisonings. However, after an extensive investigation, authorities found no connection between him and the Chicago incidents. He was charged with extortion and sentenced to 20 years in prison but was released in 1995 after serving 13 years.

In response to the crisis, Tylenol introduced tamper-evident seals and solid pills, making contamination more difficult. The “Tylenol bill” passed in 1983 made tampering with consumer products a federal offense.

'1839991062057693354',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1964, the Warren Commission, tasked with investigating the assassination of President Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, releases a report, concluding that Oswald acted as a ""lone gunman.”

President Kennedy was shot and killed while traveling in an open-top limousine during a motorcade in Dallas in 1963.

Less than an hour after the shooting, Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine employed at the Texas School Book Depository, shot a police officer who questioned him. He was arrested in a movie theater shortly after. Oswald was charged with the murders of Kennedy and Officer J.D. Tippit.

The following day, as Oswald was being transferred from the Dallas police headquarters, Jack Ruby shot him with a concealed revolver in front of police and reporters. Ruby, a nightclub owner with ties to organized crime, claimed he acted out of anger over Kennedy’s assassination.

As Oswald was killed shortly after assassinating Kennedy, his motive remained unclear. In response, President Johnson established the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. Led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the commission included U.S. senators, representatives, a former CIA director, and a former World Bank president.

Over nearly a year, the commission examined reports from the FBI, Secret Service, and others, reviewed Oswald’s background, and interviewed hundreds of witnesses while visiting the assassination site in Dallas. 

The commission released an 888-page report concluding that Oswald fired three shots from a sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository, killing Kennedy and injuring Governor Connally. While the report detailed Oswald’s life and connections, it did not explore his motives. It also criticized the Secret Service for inadequate security during Kennedy’s Dallas visit and stated that Jack Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald.

This finding did not satisfy many witnesses and researchers who found inconsistencies in the report. Various conspiracy theories emerged, implicating entities like the Cuban and Soviet governments, organized crime, the FBI, CIA, and even Vice President Johnson. Critics pointed to ballistics evidence and a home movie that seemed to challenge the claim that three bullets from Oswald caused Kennedy's fatal wounds and Connally's injuries.

In the late 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) conducted a new investigation. Their report supported the Warren Commission's finding that Oswald fired two bullets but also suggested a high probability of a second gunman and an unspecified conspiracy behind the assassination. Both reports remain subjects of debate.

'1839273107342664142',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1960, the first televised debate between major party presidential candidates took place in U.S. history. 

Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy and Republican Vice President Richard Nixon debated U.S. domestic issues in a Chicago studio. Kennedy recognized that the debates could significantly boost his campaign. The 43-year-old Massachusetts senator, who had risen from relative obscurity to become the Democratic nominee, faced challenges regarding his perceived inexperience as a leader. In preparation, he reviewed key facts and napped and tanned before the debate. He appeared well-rested and fit, a fact later acknowledged by Richard Nixon.

In contrast, Nixon was exhausted and unwell. The sitting Vice President had been campaigning vigorously across all 50 states and had recently spent time in the hospital due to a knee injury and subsequent infection. Arriving at the debate with a fever and in pain, he looked haggard, with debate producer Don Hewitt remarking that he appeared ""like death warmed over."" Despite his condition, Nixon chose to proceed with the debate, fearing that withdrawing would make him seem cowardly.

Interestingly, listeners on the radio believed Nixon won the presidential debate, while viewers who watched it thought Kennedy was the victor.

Although Nixon performed better in the second and third debates, Kennedy ultimately won the election, securing 49.7% of the popular vote against Nixon's 49.6%, making it one of the closest elections in U.S. history.

Nixon returned to presidential politics in 1968 but chose not to debate his opponent, similar to Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Televised debates resumed in 1976 and have been a staple of presidential campaigns ever since.",en,Tweet,0,28,9,5,2341,2024-09-26 12:57:35,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYZpJLzWwAEb9Lz.jpg

'1838915886276628949',"Have you ever heard of the country Andorra?

On #ThisDayInHistory in 1939, Andorra and Germany sign a peace treaty to end World War I, as Andorra was forgotten in the 1918 Treaty of Versailles. 

Andorra is a small European nation located between France and Spain, covering less than 200 square miles and home to just 85,000 people. 

During WWI, Andorra symbolically declared war on Germany but never sent troops, as it has no standing army. When the Treaty of Versailles was signed, Andorra wasn't invited, leaving it in a state of ""belligerence"" without active conflict.

Despite remaining technically at war, Andorra didn't participate in WWII, likely due to its lack of military capability and its role as a smuggling route. The ""war"" became largely forgotten, until Andorra finally made peace with Germany in 1939, marking the official end of World War I for everyone just as World War II was kicking off.",en,Tweet,0,15,0,3,1821,2024-09-25 13:18:07,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYUkQJnXAAA7EUy.jpg
