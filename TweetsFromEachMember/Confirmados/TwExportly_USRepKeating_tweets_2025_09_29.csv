'1965511409770332519',"Today I met Belarusian political activist Siarhei Tsikhanouski. My full statement:

Today, I met with @tsikhanouski_s - just three months after his release from political imprisonment in Belarus. This is a man who just 100 days ago was living in complete solitary confinement, in horrific conditions, after being illegally detained.  His bravery and resilience should be an example to us all.

As Belarus Caucus Co-Chair, I have worked for more than 5 years to help facilitate the release of Siarhei and the more than 1,300 political prisoners who remain behind bars. Siarhei is an example of courage, conviction, determination, and more than anything else – love of his homeland.  He has consistently stood up in defense of the values he and the entire Free Belarus movement support. I know we have Siarhei’s support as we continue to advocate for those who remain behind bars.

While Siarhei was imprisoned, his wife, Sviatlana, advocated on his behalf and on behalf of all Belarusians who detest the brutal Lukashenka regime. In March 2020, as Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Sviatlana testified before the Subcommittee in her first public interaction with the United States government. Then, and now, she continues the fight for a Free Belarus. I am so grateful that Siarhei has now rejoined her on this journey.",en,Tweet,1,76,14,7,10470,2025-09-09 21:23:32,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0bmLWZWEAAa4Rv.jpg
