I want to assure the community that his accolades and decorations – the Medal of Honor, the Purple Heart, the Presidential Unit Citation, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with two bronze stars, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with star, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with palm, the Military Merit Medal and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal – continue to be recognized with respect and held in high regard.
