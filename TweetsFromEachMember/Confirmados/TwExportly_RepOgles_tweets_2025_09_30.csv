Within HOURS, multiple professors have contacted my office, blowing the whistle on just how aggressively Belmont University’s administration is pushing DEI indoctrination behind the scenes.

With the help of constituent @AlexisWilkins, I obtained a leaked email confirming that as of April, Belmont has an active Faculty DEI Committee—and they’re even holding faculty elections for a DEI Chair for the upcoming school year.

This is in direct defiance of President Trump’s executive order demanding the elimination of DEI bureaucracy in federally funded institutions.

Given the scale and scope of President Trump’s recent achievements—especially the impending enactment of the Big Beautiful Bill, the historic act that will ignite America’s Golden Age—it is essential that we immortalize President Trump’s likeness on Mount Rushmore.

Like Washington, Trump did not seek his position for glory but out of love for his country, championing American independence and reshaping the presidency with dynamism, clarity, and purpose.

Like Jefferson, he expanded America’s horizons by pursuing new frontiers and breaking away from deep state tyrants.

Like Teddy Roosevelt, Trump took on entrenched interests, reinvigorated American industry, and avenged the working class against bureaucratic bloat and corporate corruption.

'1929963970875797778',"🚨 BREAKING: My office has obtained disturbing footage tied to an illegal alien reportedly on the run in Nashville.

While celebrating his 21st birthday, Zach Carach was allegedly struck by a vehicle driven by Tony Lopez — who then fled the scene.  Lopez is an illegal alien with six outstanding warrants. He was last seen in Mt. Juliet — in my district. The license plate in the photo is reportedly linked to the vehicle that picked up Lopez after he abandoned a damaged rental car.

For context: Lopez entered the U.S. illegally in the fall of 2023 — when Joe Biden was President.

Zach remains hospitalized, yet Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell appears more focused on obstructing federal immigration enforcement than protecting the people of this city. Over the past two weeks, his administration has been accused of leaking DHS agent identities, directing questionable “charity” funds to illegal aliens, and publicly attacking law enforcement officials.

Why won’t he confront the surge of illegal aliens contributing to chaos in Middle Tennessee?

If Mayor O’Connell won’t take action against fugitives in our communities, then it’s up to us — law-abiding Americans — to help. Share this post and demand justice for Zach. President Trump worked to secure our border. Now local leaders must do their part to help ICE remove those who never should have been here in the first place.

Instead of defending our state, Mayor Freddie O’Connell is sabotaging it. He’s weaponized his office to dox and surveil federal agents who are trying to stop violent criminals — and worse, he’s embraced those criminals by creating a taxpayer-funded program to aid illegal aliens.

The recipients of these funds are untraceable. The purpose is crystal clear: help illegal foreigners evade the law.

I refuse to sit back while our communities are overrun — while our neighborhoods are destroyed and our daughters are assaulted. And I doubly refuse to stay silent while blue city mayors aid and abet this invasion.

🔴 Answer: Yes. Alexander Hamilton wrote about this matter in Federalist 65. He suggested that the subjects of impeachments ""are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.""

Each of the judges with impeachment articles drafted against them has violated the public's trust by overtly targeting President Trump and his administration. Their rulings are intended to be politically undermining and nothing else.
