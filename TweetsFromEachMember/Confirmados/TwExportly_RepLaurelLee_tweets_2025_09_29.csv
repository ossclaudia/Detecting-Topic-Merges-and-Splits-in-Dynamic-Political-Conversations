❌ There was inadequate planning and coordination between the USSS and local law enforcement—including no unified command post.
❌ The Secret Service did not place the AGR complex that the shooter fired from inside the secure perimeter.
❌ Critical pieces of information on July 13 moved slowly due to fragmented lines of communication and unclear chains of command.
❌ Crooks did not use a ladder to access the AGR roof. Instead, he climbed on the roof using an air conditioning unit.
