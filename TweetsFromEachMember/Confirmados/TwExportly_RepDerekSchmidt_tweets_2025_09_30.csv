'1940842306162102639',"Congressman Schmidt issued the following statement celebrating the passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"":

“Last November, Americans voted for change in Washington, D.C. Today, Congress is delivering much of the change promised by President Trump’s America First agenda that voters in our Second Congressional District chose by a large margin.

“We make America safer by funding permanent border security and the removal of illegal aliens from our country. We also strengthen and modernize our national defense.

“We make America more affordable by canceling an estimated $1,200 tax increase scheduled for hundreds of thousands of Kansans I represent. We make permanent key parts of the 2017 tax cuts that are helping middle-class Kansas families, including the expanded child tax credit, provisions supporting main street businesses, and the increased standard deduction used by more than 90% of Second District taxpayers. We add new tax relief for seniors, workers, and families, including no tax on tips, tax cuts on the purchase of American-made vehicles, and savings that offset taxes on Social Security for more than 80% of the seniors who receive benefits. We also provide stability and support for farmers and ranchers throughout our district by enacting critical parts of the long-overdue Farm Bill. These policies support growth and economic development throughout eastern and central Kansas.

“This bill also includes specific wins for Kansas that I fought for and supported, including provisions to protect Kansas hospitals and to support low-income housing, community banks, disabled people, students, and farmers. The people of the Second District will always be my first priority, and I will continue to work to strengthen services that meet Kansas needs.

“America is more than $36 trillion in debt and sinking further each year because federal spending keeps growing faster than revenues, which is why we are bending the curve of federal spending growth downward by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. By themselves, these savings are not enough to put America’s finances in order, but they’re a long overdue start and represent the first federal spending reduction in a generation. In the coming weeks, I’ll continue working to protect taxpayers and lower spending by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse throughout our government.

“Americans expect us to do what is necessary for our country even when it is hard. In our big and diverse country, enacting change requires compromise. This legislation contains some provisions I don’t support and omits others I favor, but its benefits to the Kansans I represent easily exceed its shortcomings. America cannot remain on our decades-long path toward insolvency and weakness, nor can we tax and spend our way to prosperity, strength, or a more free and secure future. The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ takes a first step toward putting our country back on track as I promised Kansans I would work hard to do, and for that reason it received my vote.”",en,Tweet,0,9,3,11,618,2025-07-03 19:37:19,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
