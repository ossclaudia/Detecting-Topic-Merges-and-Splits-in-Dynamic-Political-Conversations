Old battles have indeed become new again, but if there is one thing that John taught us, it’s that we must press on!

When I am at my most distraught, I think about John's words as he crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the last time before his passing. His body was frail and riddled with cancer but his mind was sharp and his charge to us was clear.

“Never give up. Never give in. Keep the faith, and keep your eyes on the prize.”

My friends, we are living through troubling times. We can be tired. We can be frustrated. We can be downright mad. But what we cannot do is give up.

Just imagine where we would be if John Lewis and those Foot Soldiers had given up on Bloody Sunday. They were beaten, bruised, gassed, and whipped. They had every reason to throw up their hands and surrender!

But they didn't. They got back up and tried again. They marched on until victory was won.

Now more than ever, we need to take a page from their playbook.
