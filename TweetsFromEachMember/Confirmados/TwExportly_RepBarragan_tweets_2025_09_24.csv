After deploying the military onto the streets of Los Angeles, the Trump administration has now assaulted a sitting U.S. Senator for simply doing his job.

Senator Alex Padilla, while attending a press conference, was violently shoved, forced to the ground, and handcuffed for asking a question.

Meanwhile, immigrants, largely with no criminal records, are being targeted in ICE raids. National Guard and Marines patrol our neighborhoods against the governor’s wishes.

Congressional Republicans are trying to gut Medicaid — cutting nearly $1 trillion in healthcare so billionaires can get more tax breaks.

But this isn’t just numbers on a page. It’s people. It’s families in our community who rely on Medicaid to survive.

I serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee — the committee in Congress that oversees Medicaid. Next week, we’ll hold a  markup to debate the Republican budget plan that would slash this vital program.

Every day until then, I’m sharing stories from LA County — real people whose lives and care are at stake. If Republicans want to talk about cutting Medicaid, they need to face the human cost.
I’ll be there to fight back. #ProtectMedicaid
