'1969847476044910907',"This reckless decision by the UK, Canada, and Australia is a betrayal of our ally Israel and a gift to Hamas and Iran’s terror proxies. Rewarding terrorism with premature recognition does nothing to advance peace and will only embolden extremists whose stated goal is the destruction of Israel. Just today, senior Hamas leader Ghazi Hamad admitted that this recognition is ‘one of the fruits of October 7.’ These countries are legitimizing terrorism and validating the mass murder of innocent civilians. It is shameful and dangerous.

Israel has every right to defend itself and determine its own future without foreign governments dictating terms. As I have said before, the path to peace is simple: Hamas must surrender, release all hostages, and renounce its mission to wipe Israel off the map. Anything less is appeasement and puts innocent lives at risk.

America must stand firm with Israel and reject these misguided moves by our allies. The United States cannot and should not follow suit.

Our bill will double the standard deduction and provide massive tax relief to working and middle class families. No taxes on overtime or tips and an enhanced child tax credit = a lot more money back in folks’ pockets. 🏠 ✅ 💰

This is meaningful relief for middle-class families in the Hudson Valley who have been hit hard by the current $10,000 cap.

In addition to securing SALT relief, we were able to ensure pass-through entities are able to deduct their state and local taxes as well, a big win for small businesses across the country.

Just today, local utility companies are advising that blackouts may occur due to the heat wave increasing demand on our grid, with 6200 power outages already reported by Con Edison.

'1894059777115963808',"Today marks the third anniversary of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. To be clear: Vladimir Putin is a vile dictator and thug and has committed countless war crimes on his march towards rebuilding the old Soviet Union. He alone is responsible for the devastation that has been wrought over these past three years.                                   

As Ukraine has sought to defend itself and its people, we have rightly supported them. They have fought valiantly in defense of freedom and Democracy — ideals Vladimir Putin would never support.

However, this war must come to an end, and a settlement be negotiated that ensures Ukraine’s sovereignty and lasting peace in the region. In the absence of that, I am concerned about the path forward. If Ukraine falls it will have devastating consequences for Europe, the United States, and the free world.

As negotiations commence, we must be clear-eyed and hold Putin and Russia accountable for their conduct. We must ensure Putin and Russia are removed from Ukraine. And we must ensure stronger economic and national security ties between the United States, and Ukraine as the rebuilding process begins. There is a long road ahead, but I am confident we will be able to bring this war to an end and reassert America’s role as Leader of the Free  World.",en,Tweet,4,83,15,32,2809,2025-02-24 16:20:15,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1838739825693753638',The Enhanced Presidential Security Act just passed the Senate unanimously after passing the House 405-0 last week. I’ve been proud to work with @RepRitchie and @SenRickScott on this. Its swift passage through both chambers is a testament to what can get done if we work together. https://t.co/q8e0zpDw6z,en,Tweet,0,32,8,13,2170,2024-09-25 01:38:31,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1838739547531751427/vid/avc1/720x1280/ClN-fud1Bpzk22gw.mp4?tag=16
