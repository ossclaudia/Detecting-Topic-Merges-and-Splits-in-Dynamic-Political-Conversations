What did you learn in your internship that has helped you through the rest of your college career?  “I learned many valuable things during my time interning in Senator Rounds' office. I continue to use many of those lessons during my time in law school and while working in a law firm. Communication is a big part of interning in the Senate, whether it be communicating with constituents, those who are coming in to meet with the Senator, or other staff members. Learning how to address different people and situations has helped me in school and work as I am able to communicate efficiently and effectively with clients, professors, attorneys, and other staff members. I also enjoyed getting to learn about the legislative process and feel that knowledge has helped me understand the legislative side of the laws I am learning in school. I could go on and on about the things I learned while interning as I gained so much knowledge and experience during my short time in DC.”

Is there a memory from your internship that still sticks out to you? “I have so many memories from my internship, but some of my favorites were getting to go with Senator Rounds to meet with people from my hometown or running into people I knew around the capital. It is always good to see a familiar face when you're away from home! You always felt special getting to go with the Senator to do things as many of the interns for other senators did not get this opportunity! Outside of the office, I enjoyed taking in some Washington Nationals' games and of course beating Senator Thune's team in softball!”",en,Tweet,0,8,5,85,2943,2025-07-09 22:10:52,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gvcec6_XgAAex86.jpg

In addition, this Iranian regime has clearly been preparing to make nuclear weapons for years. Their only purpose was to threaten Israel and the United States. They were doing this while pretending to negotiate in good faith. Time to call it what it is.

What did you learn in your internship that has helped you through the rest of your college career? 
“One thing I learned throughout the summer internship is adaptability and the value of asking questions. Senator Rounds’ office has many constituent services and legislative responsibilities that ensure all tasks are done efficiently and on time. Adapting to situations, asking clarifying questions, and critically listening to staff and constituents’ requests has helped me become a better student by encouraging me to grow in the comfort that not knowing everything right away is okay. Asking questions helps you better understand what is required of you to complete any task to the best of your ability, which has helped me throughout my entire college experience.”

Is there a memory from your internship that still sticks out to you? 
“Although I made many great memories, some that stick out to me include the times I spent at different Senate Committee Hearings on Capitol Hill. These opportunities deepened my understanding of how the legislative branch of the government functions and deepened my appreciation for the work that Senators, specifically Senator Rounds, do for South Dakotans. Outside of the internship, exploring the Washington D.C. area over the summer was also one of my favorite parts of the summer.”",en,Tweet,0,5,2,4,839,2025-06-10 20:04:22,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtGraWxXIAAXslh.jpg

'1928174547062378808',"Lorraine has been a valuable member of our team for over two years. We fully support her appointment as the State Director of Rural Development. With more than 30 years of experience in housing and economic development, Lorraine’s knowledge and expertise have been a real asset on our legislative team. Her career of public service has made South Dakota a better place to live, work and raise a family. Lorraine will do a great job as Rural Development State Director, and while we will miss her greatly, we are excited for her as she begins this new chapter.

'1902741581846720565',"Happy to report that the TAILOR Act passed out of the Banking committee last week. Smaller financial institutions - like many across South Dakota - deserve a break from burdensome overregulation. My bill would require federal financial regulators to consider individual financial institutions' risk profiles when formulating regulations. This would mean the regulation would actually match the risk, allowing these community banks and credits unions to focus on serving their customers instead of trying to comply with one-size-fits-all regulations.

South Dakotans rely on USPS’s rural services to receive their mail. Transferring local processing operations to Fargo, North Dakota would have resulted in a slower delivery time for packages and letters, particularly for letters originating in Huron that simply need to be sent across town.
