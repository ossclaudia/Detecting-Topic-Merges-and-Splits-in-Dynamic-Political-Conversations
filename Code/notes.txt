The next part is to divide the tweets in weeks. The tweets gathered are from 25/09/2024 to 24/09/2025. To make all weeks have 7 days, the starting date will be 26/09/2024 (Thursday) and each week slice will start at a Thursday and end at a Wednesday, finishing at 24/09/2025. 52 week files will, therefore, be created


df['created_at'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created_at'])

df = df.sort_values('created_at')

start_date = pd.Timestamp("2024-09-26")  # Thursday
end_date = pd.Timestamp("2025-09-24")    # Wednesday

os.makedirs("datasets/weeks", exist_ok=True)

week_num = 1
current_start = start_date

while current_start <= end_date:
    current_end = current_start + pd.Timedelta(days=6)  # From Thursday until next Wednesday
    
    mask = (df['created_at'] >= current_start) & (df['created_at'] <= current_end)
    week_df = df.loc[mask]
    
    week_filename = f"week{week_num}.csv"
    week_df.to_csv(os.path.join("datasets/weeks", week_filename), index=False)
    
    current_start = current_end + pd.Timedelta(days=1)
    week_num += 1
