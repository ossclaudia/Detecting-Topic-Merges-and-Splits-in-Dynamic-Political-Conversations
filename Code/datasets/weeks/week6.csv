"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1851955105039278379',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 100 BC, the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, celebrated on to mark the end of the harvest and the onset of winter, began. 

The Celts, who lived in what is now Ireland, the UK, and northern France, believed this night blurred the line between the living and the dead. They lit bonfires, wore costumes, and performed rituals to ward off spirits and seek guidance from Druids, the Celtic priests.

In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III established November 1 as All Saints Day, which integrated elements of Samhain, leading to the evening before being known as All Hallows Eve, or Halloween. By the 9th century, as Christianity spread, it further absorbed Celtic traditions, and November 2 became All Souls’ Day, honoring the dead in ways similar to Samhain.

While Halloween celebrations were limited in Puritan New England due to strict religious beliefs, they thrived in southern colonies where communal harvest celebrations emerged. With the arrival of Irish immigrants in the late 19th century, Halloween gained national popularity. These immigrants brought customs like dressing in costumes, where children went door-to-door asking for food, evolving into the modern trick-or-treating tradition.

By the late 1800s, there was a concerted effort in America to reshape Halloween into a community-focused holiday, emphasizing neighborly gatherings over its darker roots. This led to the rise of Halloween parties, featuring games, seasonal foods, and festive costumes. Newspapers and community leaders advocated for removing frightening elements, resulting in a Halloween that lost much of its superstitious and religious connotations by the early 20th century, focusing instead on fun and community spirit.",en,Tweet,2,29,4,4,2399.0,2024-10-31 11:51:19,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbN3WjCW8AA2oGt.jpg

UNRWA is the only organization currently able to provide essential services to respond to the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the West Bank.

With this latest wrongful action, Netanyahu not only harms the innocent now but still refuses to prioritize the release of the hostages, and once again demonstrates the wisdom of those former top Israeli defense and security officials who have identified him as an existential threat to Israel itself.

Here is our joint statement about the many concerns that were raised by veterans and VSO representatives:  

“On October 16, we met with local veterans and Veteran Service Organizations at the Palm Springs Air Museum to address critical issues in veterans' health care. Listening to veterans share their struggles with referral delays and inefficiencies at the Loma Linda VA, and the lack of accountability among senior VA leaders underscored the urgent need for veteran-centered reforms to hold failing leaders accountable. That’s why we’re leading H.R. 2478, the Restore VA Accountability Act, to bring accountability back to VA nationwide, for good.

One key concern raised was the lack of reliable transportation in the region, which forces many veterans to face unnecessary logistical barriers when it comes to receiving essential healthcare. This is unacceptable. We are committed to advancing legislation that holds the entire VA accountable – including Loma Linda VA employees – to ensure that no veteran encounters barriers when receiving the timely, high-quality care they have earned.

Together, we are fighting to create a health care system that prioritizes transparency, accountability, and respect for those who have served our country. Veterans gave their all for this nation, and it is our duty to honor that sacrifice by building a system that meets their needs no matter what.”",en,Tweet,0,11,2,13,861.0,2024-10-31 19:29:07,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbPf-J-akAI44ME.jpg

Today’s thorough report from Chairwoman Foxx and the Education and Workforce Committee shows students why they may want to consider getting a degree elsewhere.
 
Pro-Hamas encampments grew and were allowed to fester on college campuses in the aftermath of the horrific terrorist attack on October 7, 2023. Harvard chose not to stop students from shouting antisemitic phrases; Northwestern’s provost approved of boycotts of Israeli products and put radical anti-Israel faculty in charge of negotiations with pro-Hamas encampments; at Columbia, faculty obstructed plans to discipline antisemitic students who stormed a campus building; and at UCLA, officials stood by idly as illegal, antisemitic encampments endangered and violated the rights of Jewish students. In each instance, these institutions violated the law and their own codes of conduct. Across the board, too many of our ‘elite’ university classrooms have been transformed into training camps for anti-American and anti-Israel activism, subsidized by the taxpayer.

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1852303430330519790',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1955, a bomb aboard United Airlines Flight 629 kills 44 people. 

The flight took off from Denver, bound for Portland. Just 11 minutes into the flight, the plane crashed near Longmont, killing all 39 passengers and five crew members. Initial investigations revealed signs of an explosion; wreckage analysis showed damage to the fuselage, and eyewitnesses reported seeing fireballs in the sky and on the ground.

As the investigation progressed, it became clear that the crash was not due to mechanical failure or pilot error. The FBI was called in to pursue a criminal investigation. A crucial lead emerged when investigators found that passenger Daisie E. King had been carrying newspaper clippings concerning her son, Jack Gilbert Graham, who had a criminal history involving forgery and was on a local most-wanted list. Notably, Graham was the beneficiary of at least $37,500 in life insurance policies on his mother, and there were reports of strained relations between them.

As the investigation deepened, FBI agents discovered detonating wire at Graham's residence. This prompted further interrogation, during which Graham confessed to his heinous act: he had constructed a homemade bomb using 25 sticks of dynamite, hidden it in his mother’s luggage, and set it to explode after a timed delay, having purchased a 60-minute timing device shortly before the flight.

Graham's motives were rooted in financial gain; in addition to the life insurance policies, he stood to inherit a significant sum upon his mother's death. Testimonies revealed frequent arguments between them, supporting the notion of a strained relationship leading to Graham's desperate act.

Ultimately, he was found guilty and sentenced to death, with his execution taking place in January 1957.

One lingering question about the case was why Graham was only charged with the murder of his mother despite the loss of 44 lives. Legal experts noted that this strategy was likely the most straightforward route to secure a death penalty conviction, as specific laws governing airline bombings had yet to be established.",en,Tweet,1,19,4,3,2459.0,2024-11-01 10:55:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbS0Js_XAAA3gjk.jpg

They are people like Valerie Hamilton, who dedicates her life to creating enriching opportunities for our Children in Bristol; Jeff Bekos, the devoted Doylestown Dad (One Dads Mission) who cycled across the country to raise funds for the @RMHC in gratitude for the support he received during his daughter’s health battle; the committed members of Levittown's Queen Bees Foundation, who unite to uplift those in need; Chrissy Elberson, a @BensalemSchools teacher who goes beyond the classroom to empower our future leaders; the members of Shir Ami Reform Synagogue in Newtown, who collected nearly 40,000 pounds of food to feed our neighbors in need; Plumstead Township Police Chief David Mettin, a steadfast public servant for over 37 years; young Layla Peck, a 7-year-old who organized a surprise celebration for one of our cherished World War II veterans; the Bucks Dragon Boat Senior Ladies A Team, who together saved a life; and Elizabeth Todderud, who handcrafted over 300 blankets for local military families welcoming new life. Each of them, along with so many others, reminds us of what we can achieve through everyday acts of kindness and strength.

Howard Hughes, a successful Hollywood producer, founded the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1932 and made several aviation records, including a transcontinental flight in 1937 and a round-the-world trip in 1938. After the U.S. entered World War II, Hughes was commissioned to develop the H-4 flying boat. Originally conceived by Henry Kaiser, the project fell to Hughes due to Kaiser’s withdrawal. With steel in short supply, the aircraft was primarily made of wood, which led to its nickname. It was intended to transport over 700 troops.

The development cost $23 million and took so long that the war ended before its completion in 1946. Critics questioned its viability, prompting Congress to require a demonstration of airworthiness. Hughes surprised thousands of spectators by flying the Spruce Goose for a mile over Long Beach Harbor.

Despite this successful flight, the Spruce Goose never entered production due to concerns about its wooden structure. After becoming increasingly reclusive, Hughes maintained the aircraft in a climate-controlled hangar until his death in 1976. The Spruce Goose is now displayed at the Evergreen Aviation Museum in McMinnville, Oregon.",en,Tweet,1,19,5,6,2387.0,2024-11-02 11:09:12,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbYA5HqW0AAdvp6.jpg

This unprecedented decision jeopardizes BILLIONS of dollars in investments and thousands of Texas jobs, not to mention generating serious uncertainty for future investments throughout the country.

Jeopardizing these projects is terrible for lots of reasons.

These projects not only drive economic activity but also help REDUCE global emissions because NATURAL GAS EXPORTS displace dirty foreign coal and dirtier gas from adversaries like RUSSIA. Only a window-licking fool would want these projects canceled.

But that’s what radical environmentalists are: fools. So we are fighting back. Because it’s not just about these projects, it’s about the precedent it sets. We can’t let this become the norm. Proud to join @tedcruz in urging the court to rehear the case.

God’s Word says that He can change the times and the seasons, so we know He is in control of this phase in our nation’s history. We pray for the season to not be volatile, and that our nation will see Christ in it.

Their anger stemmed from the U.S. allowing the deposed Shah, who had been overthrown in Iran's 1979 revolution, to enter the country for medical treatment. The students, part of a radical Islamic movement, threatened to kill hostages if any rescue attempts were made, escalating tensions between Iran and the United States.

In the wake of the takeover, Khomeini solidified his power, and after a brief period, the students began releasing non-American hostages, along with women and minorities, whom Khomeini described as oppressed by American society. However, 52 American diplomats and embassy staff remained captives for 14 months as President Jimmy Carter struggled to resolve the crisis through diplomacy. 

Carter's inability to secure a resolution was compounded by a failed military rescue mission in April 1980, which resulted in the deaths of eight U.S. servicemen. This debacle further eroded public confidence in his leadership and severely impacted his reelection campaign. 

After months of tense negotiations, a deal was finally reached, and the hostages were released on January 20, 1981, just minutes after Reagan took office, illustrating the enduring animosity towards Carter.",en,Tweet,1,35,9,8,2828.0,2024-11-04 12:01:09,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gbif9nSXsAAzFpa.jpg

It’s damning.

These were 12,000 GOVERNMENT jobs. 

It shows 100,000 American manufacturing jobs were wiped out in 2024 under Biden/Harris. 

1000s of Americans lost their jobs, while over 1 MILLION foreign-born workers got jobs.

The only problem? Trump already had a chance and he did the opposite.

➡️ He weakened Clean Water Act protections, dismantled air pollution standards, and stalled or reversed bans on toxic chemicals like chlorpyrifos and perchlorate—both linked to serious health risks, including developmental issues in children.

➡️ He appointed corporate insiders and lobbyists to oversee our environmental and chemical laws, undermining our watchdog agencies by turning them into extensions of the industries they were meant to regulate.

➡️ He picked a Big Pharma executive to run the FDA, a coal insider to oversee the EPA, and an oil lobbyist to oversee conserving our natural resources.

➡️ He pressured regulators to cover up evidence of the dangers posed by toxic chemicals, according to new allegations by whistleblowers.

➡️ He consistently favored Big Ag, and hurt small farmers by undermining rural development and prioritizing massive industrial farms that could care less about toxic pesticides in our food.

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1853767391316000779',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1940, Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to an unprecedented third term as President of the United States, becoming the first U.S. president in history to win more than two terms in office. 

Roosevelt, who had already served as president for nearly eight years, defeated his Republican opponent by a wide margin, securing 84.5% of the electoral vote. His victory reflected the continued public support for his leadership during one of the most challenging periods in American history.

FDR's presidency was marked by bold and transformative actions aimed at addressing the Great Depression and guiding the nation through the early years of World War II. Under his New Deal programs, Roosevelt introduced groundbreaking economic reforms, including Social Security, labor rights protections, and public works projects, which sought to provide relief, recovery, and reform to a country devastated by economic collapse.

As he campaigned for his third term in 1940, Roosevelt was also faced with the growing threat of global conflict. World War II was already raging in Europe, and Roosevelt had begun to prepare the U.S. for its eventual involvement, despite widespread isolationist sentiment at home.

Roosevelt's third term would prove to be pivotal, as the United States officially entered World War II in December 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt's leadership during the war would shape not only the future of the United States but also the world order in the post-war era.

FDR's election for a third term marked a significant moment in U.S. history, signaling the nation's confidence in his ability to navigate turbulent times. His continued presidency, however, also sparked debates about presidential term limits, leading to the eventual passage of the 22nd Amendment in 1951, which formally restricted U.S. presidents to two terms in office.",en,Tweet,0,28,0,9,4740.0,2024-11-05 11:52:42,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gbnnnd1XgAAVdoO.jpg

At great personal risk they stood up for each other for two challenging months. They set an example for working people everywhere – to fight for fair wages and benefits – and they were hugely successful. The deal that Machinists and Boeing came together last night to agree on delivers better benefits for Boeing workers, including a wage increase, stronger retirement plans, and other significant benefit improvements.
 
""I will always support the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain for better working conditions. I’m grateful today for the many leaders who rose to the occasion during these negotiations. Much is owed to Machinists President Job Holden, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, and the Biden-Harris Administration’s Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su for their expertise and leadership in this process.

""This new agreement should represent a new chapter for Boeing. For many decades, Boeing was a pillar of American innovation and manufacturing, but in recent times its felt like they have chosen to prioritize shareholders and investors over their own employees. I am hopeful that with this successful negotiation with the Machinists, that Boeing can learn from this experience and get back to where the company came from: a business focused not only on short-term profits but on building the best airplanes in the world. It’s their middle- and working-class employees that build value not only in Boeing but also in our broader economy. I’m glad to see their work being recognized with this agreement that sets a new standard for workers in the aerospace industry.
