The budget resolution is just a key to open the door to start reconciliation, it‚Äôs not the hill to die on.

Reconciliation is the most impactful legislation we will pass with both chambers and without Democrat votes and is where spending cuts actually happen.

That‚Äôs how Democrats accomplished their most damaging policy changes in spending under Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Reconciliation will be Energy, Border, and Tax laws and more that are much needed to send to President Trump‚Äôs desk.

President Trump is growing our economy by bringing in nearly $7 trillion of business investment and using tariffs to generate revenue and establish fairness and America‚Äôs dominance in world trade.

President Trump is reducing the size and scope of the federal government and cutting spending by getting rid of useless agencies like the Department of Education, cutting wasteful, grants and government contracts, and with DOGE rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.

"Brownley, Julia",Representative,California,26,Democratic,House: 2013-Present,Yes,RepBrownley,'1910355348709318935',"My Republican colleagues should be ashamed for advancing such a self-serving budget that continues to prioritize the interests of billionaires and big corporations over hard-working American families. This budget is not a serious plan for our nation‚Äôs future nor a responsible framework for government spending. It is a reckless giveaway to the ultra-wealthy that guts vital programs that millions of Americans rely on to survive.

Rather than providing relief to struggling families, Republicans are handing out an average tax cut of over $300,000 to the wealthiest one percent ‚Äì all while pushing the costs of these tax breaks onto everyone else and plunging millions of Americans into financial hardship. This budget isn‚Äôt just fiscally irresponsible ‚Äì it is an economic disaster.

While Americans face record-high inflation and rising costs, Republicans have done nothing to ease the pain or address the escalating economic crisis. In fact, they are actively making things worse by blindly backing Trump‚Äôs disastrous tariffs and dragging our economy toward a recession.

That is why I voted no. @HouseDemocrats are working for the American people, and I will continue fighting to protect the interests of hard-working families across this country.

Second, the Speaker of the House made a specific commitment to guarantee the House framework tying tax cuts to spending cuts.¬†This was a non-negotiable deal-breaker ¬†‚Äì and will be for the final product.¬†¬†In keeping with the House budget resolution, the commitment would mean we start with a base assumption of $2.5 Trillion in economic growth and then $1 for $1 tax cuts to spending cuts above that number ‚Äì such that when we achieve $1.4 Trillion in cuts, we will achieve the number necessary for TCJA permanence.

Third, and finally, the Senate Majority Leader committed to achieving the House minimum of $1.5 Trillion in spending cuts. This comes on top of budget topline numbers that, while aspirational, represent a significant statement of commitment by the Senate to drive down spending.

I would have preferred we amended the Senate bill to reflect these commitments.¬†But, in the interest of comity, I will take them at their word. But, to be clear, failure to achieve these baselines including deficit neutrality will make it impossible for me to support a final reconciliation product.

This is the opportunity for Congress to simply make a down payment on our $36 trillion national debt.¬†It is on all Republicans to ensure that the crippling tax of inflation does not put car and home ownership further out of reach for the American family. It is time for House and Senate committees to get to work to save our Republic from financial ruin. Failure is not an option. I look forward to working with Majority Leader Thune, Speaker Johnson, and the President to deliver for the American people.‚Äù",en,Tweet,0,66,4,23,3249.0,2025-04-10 17:55:47,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Let me set the record straight: I voted for the SAVE Act for the simple reason that American elections are for Americans. Requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote is common sense.

Some claim that requiring proof of citizenship is too onerous a burden, or that it will ""disenfranchise"" those whose names have changed for reasons like marriage. The truth is the SAVE Act ensures name changes will not prevent anyone from registering to vote.

The bill allows for several different ways to prove citizenship. But most importantly, it requires state leaders to establish protocols to allow citizens to register even if there are discrepancies in documents, such as name changes.

Maine's voting culture is the best in the nation.

For many Coloradans, especially low-income citizens who have been terrorized by Tren de Aragua, SB25-003 creates a barrier that puts firearm ownership out of reach and renders them defenseless.

The irony is not lost on me that the Trump Administration‚Äî that already contains antisemites in its ranks‚Äî is seeking to add a divisive figure like Rabbi Kaploun as its antisemitism czar.

Let‚Äôs not forget that Rabbi Kaploun is the same Trump campaign official who false claimed that President Biden, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even make a statement about combating anti-Semitism.‚Äù This insulting statement couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth. Have we all forgotten in these past months that it was the Biden Administration that developed and released the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism? Have we forgotten that President Biden would regularly invoke the antisemitism of the Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville as the very reason he returned to public life to seek higher office?

According to reports, Rabbi Kaploun also helped organize the event at which Trump claimed that if he were to lose the election, the ‚Äúthe Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss‚Äù‚Äî a textbook example of antisemitic scapegoating. At that same event, Trump made another antisemitic and conspiratorial comment, claiming that Democrats somehow had a ‚Äúhold or curse‚Äù on American Jews.

Perhaps most offensively, Rabbi Kaploun publicly claims that after October 7th, ‚ÄúDemocrats refuse to even recognize the butchers of women and kidnappers of children as terrorists.‚Äù This absurd and insulting claim does not deserve a response.

Public schools across the country ‚Äì from rural to urban communities ‚Äì will lose billions of dollars that help them afford teachers, textbooks, and supplies. Cuts to nutrition programs will see families, school children, seniors, disabled persons, and even young active-duty military families and veterans go hungry.
The Administration says they want to eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse and reduce the deficit ‚Äì which we all support ‚Äì but this budget resolution does neither. What they are doing is eliminating transparency and dismantling the government.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1910721959811227900',"Each week, we share stories from across our district that celebrate the extraordinary individuals who uplift our community with compassion, resilience, and heart. Today, we honor a young girl whose bravery has sparked a movement, whose smile has lifted thousands, and whose spirit reminds us what true courage looks like. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero: 13-year-old Lily Tomlinson of Pipersville.
 
In December, Lily was diagnosed with DIPG, a rare and aggressive brain tumor. Just weeks earlier, she was a healthy, active middle schooler‚Äîearning high honors, creating art, reading books, laughing with friends, and doting on her little brother, Luca. Then, without warning, came a diagnosis no family is ever prepared to hear.
 
But even in the face of such devastating news, Lily's beautiful spirit continues to shine with hope, heart, and resilience.
 
With a Taylor Swift blanket tucked around her legs, a sticker of her favorite animal‚Äîa black cat‚Äîon her cheek, and a soft smile that says more than words ever could, Lily lifts her left hand high and offers a thumbs up.
 
‚ÄúA thumbs up means I can still hold my hand up,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing good. Just smile and wave, boys, smile and wave.‚Äù
 
That is Lily. Brave. Brilliant. Unbreakably positive. Even as her illness has progressed and she has lost the use of her right side, she has kept her sense of humor: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a lefty anyway.‚Äù Her positivity isn‚Äôt just admirable‚Äîit‚Äôs transformative. It‚Äôs touched her classmates, our community, and a world of strangers who now carry her story in their hearts.
 
In the months following her diagnosis, Lily‚Äôs light has reached far beyond Bucks County. She‚Äôs united everyone from neighbors here in PA-1 to Swifties around the world, who have rallied around her with messages of love, strength, and solidarity. What began as a fight for one young girl has become a testament to the power of positivity in the face of unimaginable difficulty.
 
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Rare Disease Caucus, I‚Äôm fighting to bring more attention, funding, and hope to families like Lily‚Äôs. But Lily is already teaching us what no policy ever could‚Äîhow to live with purpose and find happiness even in the most difficult moments.
 
When asked what she wants her parents to know, Lily‚Äôs answer was simple‚Äîand unforgettable: ‚ÄúThat I‚Äôll always be with them.‚Äù

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration and this week's guest stars, the @HouseGOP, delivered this week:

@therealdonaldtrump again downgraded America, pausing his chaotic tariff scheme only after crashing stock and bond markets, wiping out Americans' savings and further isolating our nation from our former allies while ratcheting up China tariffs and inviting retaliation.

@elonmusk again downgraded the savings DOGE is supposedly finding, going from his promise of $ 1T in waste, fraud and abuse savings to $150B, as he said in yesterday's Cabinet meeting. I'm thrilled to save Americans $150B but can't trust the word of Musk and DOGE.

The President has invoked a wartimes power act to label people ""enemies"" and ship them out of the country without due process guaranteed by the Constitution.

House Republicans passed a budget resolution that will cut almost $1 trillion in healthcare, adds trillions of dollars to the national debt and gives trillions of tax giveaways to the ultra rich. Trillions.

As part of that bill, the House Republicans passed a rule turning a 24-hour day inside out. The rule reads, in part, ""...each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through September 30, 2025, shall not constitute a calendar day."" Huh?

House Republicans snuck language into a larger bill to ensure they can prevent any attempt by Congress to revoke the emergency powers Trump is currently using to enact these economy-killing tariffs.

House Republicans passed the SAVE Act to suppress the votes of active duty servicemembers, married women and rural voters across the country.

House Republicans passed a bill attacking federal judges for--wait for it--following the law. (Read that again. It's a real thing.)

House Republicans passed a bill to increase overdraft fees. They used to be capped at five bucks. Thanks to Republicans, that's not the case anymore. You get hit with a much higher fee, banks make more money.

The President is using the Justice Department to go after former government officials who didn't break any laws but irritated him by following the law in his first term.

The President is trying to kill the ""notice and comment"" rules that allow for public input on government rules, in a bid to erase regulations unilaterally.

Another high-ranking female military commander was relived of duty, this time Colonel Susan Meyers of the US Space Force, stationed in Greenland.

The White House invited a ""reporter"" from Zero Hedge--a website accused of spreading Russian propaganda-- into the press pool while continuing to block the AP despite federal court ruling requiring them to be reinstated.

At the end of the Old Testament, the prophet Zechariah (Zech. 9:9) had told God's people to expect their righteous and victorious King to enter the city humbly riding on a donkey. This sign would be another confirmation that Jesus was their Savior.

The crowds assembled with great joy that day and lined the street shouting, ""Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord."" (Ps. 118:25-26) As a gesture of joy and respect, many spread their cloaks on the road and others cut branches from the nearby palm trees and placed them on His path.

In Scripture, palm branches are a symbol of victory. (Rev. 7:9)¬†¬†At the time, the Jewish people wanted a savior to deliver a temporal victory over their Roman oppressors... but Jesus arrived to deliver a much greater victory--over sin and death--for all eternity!

Secretary Collins and Chairman Bost have repeatedly assured the public that no veterans‚Äô benefits would be cut in the Administration‚Äôs ‚Äòdownsizing‚Äô efforts. The decision by VA to remove critical foreclosure assistance that prevents veterans from losing their homes proves that promise was false. Yet another critical VA program has been destroyed by Trump and DOGE.
After increasing unemployment and manipulating the stock market for their own gain, President Trump has left 15,000 veterans using the VASP program in the dark and ended a program that could help nearly 80,000 veterans who are in danger of foreclosure. Veterans and their families rely on the VASP program to avoid housing insecurity and homelessness. Now, Trump and Collins have inexplicably chosen to plunge veterans into further economic crisis.
The VASP program provided relief to veterans in every state who were on the brink of homelessness. The alternative Republicans tout‚Äîa so-called ‚Äòpartial claim program‚Äô‚Äî doesn‚Äôt exist yet, and even if it did, it wouldn‚Äôt help the veterans who are in trouble right now. Ending VASP without a real, functioning alternative in place is reckless and dangerous.

"Lee, Mike",Senator,Utah,,Republican,Senate: 2011-Present,Yes,SenMikeLee,'1912167208748265719',"Google and Facebook have a stranglehold on the digital advertising landscape.

That's why I have introduced the bipartisan AMERICA Act to break their monopoly.

Here's the deal...

When you visit a website or open an app, a real-time auction serves an ad on the website or app. The auction takes place in a fraction of second, in much the same way that electronic securities trading functions.

Billions of times every day, publishers use supply-side brokers and advertisers use demand-side brokers to connect with one another in the ad exchanges, which is a real-time auction marketplace.

As Google‚Äôs own employees have said ‚Äú[t]he analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the New York Stock Exchange.‚Äù

Digital advertising is dominated by Google and Facebook. Google, in particular, is the leading or dominant player in every part of the ad tech stack: buy-side, sell-side, and the exchange that connects them.

For example, Google Ad Manager is used by 90% of large publishers, and in the third quarter of 2018 it served 75% of all online display ad impressions.

Google uses its pervasive market power across the digital advertising ecosystem, and exploits numerous conflicts of interest, to extract monopoly rents and stack the deck in its favor. These monopoly rents function as a tax‚Äîupwards of 40%‚Äîon every ad-supported website and every business that advertises online, collectively a huge segment of the modern
economy.

Examples of alleged conduct by Google include:

¬∑  Giving its own ad services information and speed advantages over competitors
¬∑  Steering bids to its own services to the detriment of its customers and competitors
¬∑  Using information about its competitors‚Äô trading activity to give its own properties an advantage
¬∑  Coercing publishers to license Google‚Äôs ad server
¬∑  Using its control over publisher ad serving to block competition from other ad exchanges
¬∑  Manipulating auctions to exclude competition from competing ad services
¬∑  Hiding anticompetitive behavior behind opaque and non-transparent practices
¬∑  Using its control over the ad stack to punish publishers and competitors that try to develop new
competitive alternatives to circumvent Google‚Äôs abuse

Google is not the only company that operates on both sides of the ad tech market, however. Rules to address its stranglehold should be written broadly, to avoid replacing one abusive monopolist with another.

The Advertising Middlemen Endangering Rigorous Internet Competition Accountability (AMERICA) Act restores and protects competition in digital advertising in two ways:

1. The AMERICA Act prohibits large digital advertising companies from owning more than one part of the digital ad ecosystem if they process more than $20 billion in digital ad transactions:

a) Ad exchange owners cannot own supply-side platform or demand-side platform.

b) Supply-side platform owners cannot also own a demand-side platform, and vice versa.

c) Buyers and sellers of digital advertising cannot own a demand-side platform or supply-side platform (except to sell their own advertising inventory).

2. The AMERICA Act requires medium-sized and larger digital advertising companies that process more than $5 billion in digital ad transactions to abide by several obligations to protect their customers and competition. The key obligations include the following:

a) They must act in the best interests of their customers, including by making the best execution for bids on ads.

b) They must provide transparency to their customers so that those customers can verify they are acting in their best interest.

c) If allowed to operate on both sides of the market, the company must erect firewalls to prevent abuse and conflicts of interest.

d) They must provide fair access to all customers with respect to performance and information related to transactions, exchange processes, and functionality.

These restrictions and requirements mirror those imposed on electronic trading in the financial sector‚Äî an industry to which Google itself has compared its technology.

The AMERICA Act would be enforced by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general. It also includes a private right of action for violations of the best interest, transparency, and other requirements imposed at the $5 billion threshold when committed by companies over the $20 billion threshold.

If it becomes law, the bill would most likely require Google and Facebook to divest significant portions of their advertising businesses‚Äîbusiness units that account for or facilitate a large portion of their ad revenue. Amazon may also have to make divestments, and the bill will impact Apple‚Äôs accelerating entry into third-party ads.

Several smaller ad tech competitors would also fall under the best interest and transparency requirements, but industry experts have confirmed that any compliance burden would not impair their ability to compete.

If you made it this far, thank you and congratulations!

Passed in 2017, the TCJA delivered the largest middle-class tax cut in U.S. history, reduced taxes for the lowest-income Americans by 10%, and drove the fastest two-year growth in real wages in two decades‚Äîall while helping lower wealth inequality.

If Congress allows these tax cuts to expire, a family of four in Pennsylvania will be forced to pay an additional $1,491 in taxes each year.

Additionally, small businesses would benefit by the extension of several provisions, like 100% bonus depreciation and the section 199A small business deduction, which would allow for greater reinvestment and growth for these businesses.

For younger workers paying into the program now, don‚Äôt be fooled by lies concerning fraud, of which there is almost none. Social Security is not a Ponzi Scheme; it is a hard-earned benefit you pay for and will need in retirement, likely more than any generation before you as wealth inequality worsens, higher education and housing becomes more expensive, and Republican tax breaks for billionaires threaten the Trust Fund.

Tell Trump and Musk to keep their #HandsOff Social Security.
