Lauderdale Naval Air Station in Florida for a routine training mission and disappeared inside the Bermuda Triangle. 

After completing their initial objective, the flight plan called for them to head east for 67 miles, then north for 73 miles, before returning to the base, totaling 120 miles. 

Two hours into the mission, the flight leader, an experienced pilot, reported compass failures and became disoriented. His instruments malfunctioned, and the other pilots experienced similar issues. Despite attempts to contact land-based radio stations, the squadron's location could not be determined. At 6:20 p.m., the flight leader sent a confused radio message suggesting that the planes may have to ditch due to fuel shortage. By then, radar had located Flight 19 north of the Bahamas, but the search was complicated by poor weather.

A search and rescue Mariner aircraft with a 13-man crew was dispatched at 7:27 p.m., but it disappeared shortly after takeoff. A tanker off the Florida coast reported seeing an explosion. Despite one of the largest air and sea searches in history, no trace of the planes or the crew members was ever found.

The VA requested and received from Congress $2.88 billion to address an end-of-fiscal-year benefits funding shortfall, later revealing this funding was not actually needed & remains unspent.

The VA has now sought $12 billion to address a projected health care budget shortfall for FY25, which they later revised to $6.6 billion, providing little explanation for this sudden change.

This raises serious questions about the budgetary management of the Biden Administration and the VA.

"Peters, Scott H.",Representative,California,50,Democratic,House: 2013-Present,Yes,RepScottPeters,'1864751497004875822',"Over the Thanksgiving break, I heard a lot of concern about the proposed 23-story tower in Pacific Beach. The developer found a parcel technically not covered by the coastal height limit and aggregated a number of density incentives from state law to add up to a very tall project.

I support building more housing in our existing neighborhoods. I‚Äôm a founding member of San Diego YIMBY (Yes in My Backyard) Democrats and the bipartisan YIMBY Caucus in Congress. Homelessness is high where rents are high, and rents are high where supply fails to meet demand. The cost of housing is the biggest impediment to the prosperity of the Golden State, and unless we lower costs, our teachers, police, firefighters, and our children won‚Äôt be able to live here. To lower costs, we need more homes.

Part of the solution is to build more housing on underused properties in our existing neighborhoods, including coastal neighborhoods like Pacific Beach. New housing can improve neighborhoods and make them more vibrant, walkable, and safe. It‚Äôs what I did as a City Councilmember when we added 138 units on La Jolla Boulevard as part of the redesign. The Seahaus project replaced a dilapidated motel with an attractive housing project now inhabited by customers of local businesses, children in local schools, and engaged neighbors. The developer also funded the construction of two of the five roundabouts. It wasn‚Äôt easy ‚Äì some neighbors even filed a petition for my recall from office. But in the end, we got more housing and a better neighborhood.

That‚Äôs not what we will get from the Pacific Beach proposal. Other home builders I‚Äôve spoken to worry that it will taint the reputation of all development and be a poster child for those who resist all new housing. I hope the Turquoise Street developer will reconsider the proposal and offer something in better keeping with the scale of the neighborhood. I also understand that this project will likely exceed the surrounding height limit. We can accommodate taller buildings on the major streets that can still fit in. A four or six or maybe even an eight-story building on that property could provide a good number of units, still enhance the neighborhood, and provide a path for future developments of the sort. But this project, in its 23-story form, is a mistake.",en,Tweet,7,21,7,22,6278.0,2024-12-05 19:19:36,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

I know the outgoing Biden and incoming Trump Administrations are following the developments, but I urge us to come up with proactive measures to ensure that the tens of thousands of ISIS prisoners detained in northeast Syria are not set free.

U.S. military forces have been working with the Syrian Democratic Forces to make sure ISIS does not come back in northeastern Syria. If there is a further collapse of the Syrian government, I fear that U.S. forces could be put in jeopardy. It is therefore imperative that we have contingency plans to reinforce our troops to make sure the anti-ISIS mission does not collapse. There is nothing worse for the region ‚Äì and the United States ‚Äì than to have tens of thousands of radical ISIS fighters back on the battlefield.

Syria is yet another example of what happens when you take your eye off the ball.

Al Hol refugee camp is a nightmare in the making for the entire region and world as it is being used by radical forces to recruit new fighters.

Today, we shine a spotlight on a man whose life has been defined by an unwavering commitment to service‚Äîmeet this week's Hometown Hero, Merle Winslow of Bristol Borough. 
 
A lifelong Bristol Borough resident, Merle‚Äôs legacy of service began in 1964 when he joined the Bristol Consolidated Fire Company upon graduating from Bristol High School. He then answered the call to serve his country, enlisting in the United States Army in 1965. Stationed in Germany as a Morse Code Radio Operator, his leadership and discipline quickly set him apart, earning him a promotion to Sergeant E5 in under two years‚Äîa testament to his character and resolve.
 
Upon returning home, Merle continued to answer the call to serve, this time as the Bristol Borough Fire Inspector. By 1969, he was appointed Fire Marshal, working tirelessly for nearly a decade to protect Bristol families and businesses. In 1995, Merle took on the role of Deputy Emergency Management Coordinator, and then, in 2003, stepped into the position of Emergency Management Coordinator‚Äîwhere he has served with unwavering commitment for the past 21 years. Throughout countless emergencies, Merle has been a steady, reliable leader, consistently guiding the community through crises with courage and expertise. His leadership has saved countless lives, prevented disasters, and ensured the safety of historic Bristol Borough.
 
Perhaps most inspiring is Merle‚Äôs enduring role as a volunteer firefighter. For an incredible 60 years, he has answered the call, running toward danger to protect others‚Äîa selfless commitment made even more remarkable when you consider he accomplished this alongside his demanding role as Emergency Management Coordinator.
 
Merle's lifetime of service and leadership have shaped a safer, stronger community, setting a standard for public service, and his kindness and spirit of generosity have earned him a place in the hearts of all who know him and the Bristol Borough history books. 
 
Please join me in thanking Merle for his decades of extraordinary service and wishing him a well-deserved retirement filled with happiness, joy, and the knowledge that his contributions have made an indelible impact on our community.",en,Tweet,0,5,0,1,802.0,2024-12-06 19:37:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeI7REDWsAAAlNP.jpg

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1865370104302567694',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1941, Japan launched a surprise assault on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. naval base in Hawaii, marking the U.S.'s entry into World War II. 

Tensions between the U.S. and Japan had been escalating for years due to Japan's military expansion in Asia, particularly its invasion of China. By 1941, the U.S. had cut off vital exports to Japan, including oil, and severed diplomatic relations, leading Japan to consider war.

Japan‚Äôs military leaders planned the attack on Pearl Harbor as a means to cripple the U.S. Pacific Fleet and secure unchallenged control over Southeast Asia. Despite warnings of possible Japanese aggression, U.S. military leaders did not take sufficient precautions. Tensions in Washington were high, but key warnings failed to reach Pearl Harbor in time.

The attack began at 7:55 AM with a wave of bombers, torpedo planes, and fighters targeting the U.S. fleet. The Japanese destroyed or damaged eight battleships, three cruisers, and nearly 200 aircraft, killing over 2,300 Americans. However, the U.S. aircraft carriers were not in port and survived the attack, which later proved crucial in the Pacific war.

The attack unified the U.S. public, and Congress declared war on Japan the next day with only one dissenting vote. Japan‚Äôs miscalculation led to its eventual defeat in the war. Despite the severe damage at Pearl Harbor, the U.S. was able to recover quickly, and Japan‚Äôs strategy ultimately backfired, propelling the U.S. into a total war effort that would contribute to the Allied victory but at the cost of 400,000 American lives.",en,Tweet,2,75,16,8,8116.0,2024-12-07 12:17:44,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeMgORDW8AARNJQ.jpg

We have to ensure that the roughly 50,000 ISIS prisoners in northeastern Syria ‚Äî being primarily held by Kurdish forces ‚Äî are not released. 

We should not allow the Kurdish forces ‚Äî who helped us destroy ISIS on President Trump‚Äôs watch ‚Äî to be threatened by Turkey or the radical Islamists who have taken over Syria. 

Turkey has legitimate concerns regarding different groups that reside in northeastern Syria. But if there is conflict between Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces or Turkey attacks Kurdish forces, it will set in motion an ISIS jailbreak, which would be a nightmare for America. 

The last time ISIS was in charge, thousands of Europeans and Americans were killed by ISIS plots that originated in Syria. 

Furthermore, the reemergence of ISIS creates chaos throughout the region, which is going to lead to higher gas prices for us at home. 

Turkey deserves to have a demilitarized buffer zone between northeastern Syria and Turkey to protect Turkish interests. However, if Turkey takes military action against Kurdish forces in Syria, it will jeopardize America‚Äôs interests dramatically. 

In the past I have drafted sanctions targeting Turkey if they engage in military operations against the Kurdish forces who helped President Trump destroy ISIS. I stand ready to do this again in a bipartisan way.",en,Tweet,622,5697,1103,6317,2113565.0,2024-12-09 01:54:39,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson Decries Acquittal of Daniel Penny in Jordan Neely‚Äôs Death

‚ÄúIs this who we are? Is this the new normal?‚Äù Congressman Jackson Urges Action to Restore the Sanctity of Life and Justice for Black Lives

Washington, D.C. ‚Äî Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson issued a powerful statement today in response to the acquittal of Daniel Penny, who faced charges related to the death of Jordan Neely, a young Black man experiencing a mental health crisis on a New York City subway.

‚ÄúThe outcome of this trial forces us to confront troubling questions about the society we are becoming. Is this who we are? Are we willing to accept a new normal where vigilantes feel entitled to take justice into their own hands, especially when it comes to Black lives?

Jordan Neely‚Äôs story is a heartbreaking reminder of the challenges faced by individuals living with mental health struggles. He deserved compassion, care, and assistance‚Äînot a violent end. The decision to acquit Daniel Penny sends a dangerous signal: that some lives, particularly Black lives, can be devalued without consequence.

This verdict mirrors systemic disparities we‚Äôve seen time and again. Consider how frequently Black men are subjected to harsh penalties for less severe actions. Cases like Albert Wilson and Kalief Browder underscore the glaring inequities in our justice system. Meanwhile, individuals like Penny, who take lethal action, are absolved. We must ask ourselves how we reconcile these outcomes with our claims of justice and equality.‚Äù
‚ÄúAmerica has always been a nation that wrestles with its conscience. Today, I urge us all to rise above fear and indifference, to embrace our better angels, and to reaffirm the value of every human life.

The killing of Jordan Neely should never have happened. It speaks to a failure on many levels: a failure of compassion, a failure of public systems to provide adequate mental health support, and a failure of the justice system to ensure accountability.

No one struggling with a mental health crisis should face violence instead of help. No Black life should be so easily disregarded. As a nation, we must reckon with this and commit to charting a different course.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis tragic case highlights urgent areas for action. As members of Congress, it is our responsibility to address the underlying issues that allow these injustices to persist.
1. Increase Oversight on the Use of Force:
Pass legislation that establishes      stricter standards for holding individuals accountable when they use      lethal force outside the boundaries of the law.
2. Improve Mental Health Support Systems:
Expand funding for crisis      intervention programs and mental health resources, particularly for      underserved communities.

Prioritize the passage of the Mental      Health Equity Act, which aims to address mental health disparities in      communities of color.

3. Curtail Vigilantism:
Strengthen federal penalties for      individuals who engage in extrajudicial violence, ensuring that no one      takes the law into their own hands without consequences.

4. Reform the Justice System:
Support legislation like the George      Floyd Justice in Policing Act to address racial bias and inequity in      the legal process.

5. Promote Community-Based Solutions:
Increase investments in programs      that provide non-violent responses to mental health crises, including      mobile crisis response units and peer support networks.‚Äù

6. Address Veterans‚Äô Mental Health Needs:
Adding complexity to this tragedy is Daniel Penny‚Äôs status as a military veteran. Veterans are among our nation‚Äôs most respected citizens, yet too often they face severe challenges, including mental health crises that go unaddressed. Congress must take proactive steps to ensure that veterans receive comprehensive mental health support. It is imperative to provide the necessary resources to prevent any veteran from contributing to or being caught in such devastating situations. The tragic loss of Jordan Neely is a reminder of Congress's responsibility to protect its citizens, invest in mental health services, and reform judicial inequities.

To this end, legislators like Congressmen David Trone and Ro Khanna have sponsored critical measures to address mental health needs, including:

The Occupational Therapy Mental      Health Parity Act, which enhances access to occupational therapy for mental health      under Medicare, ensuring veterans and others can access holistic,      life-improving services.
H.R. 2067, the Medication Access and      Training Expansion (MATE) Act, designed to improve training for      treating substance use disorders, which are closely tied to mental health      issues.

These legislative efforts emphasize the need for targeted support systems for veterans, addressing underlying issues such as PTSD, anxiety, and societal reintegration challenges.

Advocate for national standards      in crisis response, ensuring trained professionals‚Äînot civilians‚Äîintervene      in mental health emergencies.

Expand funding for community      mental health programs and veterans' mental health services to prevent      tragedies like this.

Congress must increase funding      for veterans‚Äô mental health services through the Department of Veterans      Affairs (VA), including therapy, counseling, and crisis intervention.

Support legislation that expands      training for veterans transitioning to civilian life, focusing on      de-escalation and understanding mental health crises in the community.

By addressing veterans‚Äô mental health needs comprehensively, we can ensure that our heroes receive the care they deserve while also helping to prevent situations where unresolved trauma may lead to tragedy.

‚ÄúThe acquittal of Daniel Penny is not just a failure of the courts‚Äîit is a failure of our collective humanity. This moment calls on all of us to reflect and act. Allowing tragedies like this to become the norm is unacceptable.
The time has come to renew our commitment to protecting the vulnerable, ensuring justice for the marginalized, and reaffirming the inherent dignity of every person.
Jordan Neely‚Äôs life mattered. Black lives matter. And as a nation, we must do better to honor that truth.‚Äù",en,Tweet,0,3,3,2,486.0,2024-12-09 22:01:51,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeY5FZZXoAAekBw.jpg

A constitutional crisis emerged in the British Empire when King Edward VIII announced his intention to marry Wallis Simpson, an American divorc√©e. This proposal faced strong opposition from the British government and the Commonwealth due to religious, legal, and moral objections. As the head of the Church of England, Edward's potential marriage to a twice-divorced woman was deemed unacceptable, as the church did not permit remarriage if the former spouse was still alive. 

Despite the objections, Edward remained determined to marry Simpson, whom he claimed to love. His refusal to give her up led to his abdication, and he was succeeded by his brother, Albert, who became George VI. Edward was given the title Duke of Windsor and married Simpson the following year. They remained married until his death 35 years later.",en,Tweet,0,23,2,4,3272.0,2024-12-10 12:32:44,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GecAbT0W4AASF_S.jpg

Her collections, including ""Black Feeling, Black Talk"" and ""Re: Creation"", were not just poetry‚Äîthey were calls to action during the #CivilRightsMovement, giving voice to the fight for equality and justice.

Nikki Giovanni reminded us that poetry is power, that art can heal, and that words can build movements. Her unwavering commitment to social justice and her celebration of Black culture taught us to resist oppression and embrace our humanity.
