At the heart of our discussion was the urgent need to align Ukraine‚Äôs economic recovery with global security‚Äîand that meant locking in a strategic minerals partnership to power both.

This is how we confront aggression: with unity, with purpose, and with the full weight of American leadership. Those who bankrolled Putin‚Äôs war machine will not profit from Ukraine‚Äôs peace. That future belongs to the Ukrainian people‚Äîand we will stand with them every step of the way.

This budget re-aligns federal spending to the priorities of the people: a secure nation, making America healthy again, a Justice Department combatting crime and not weaponized against the people, and common sense.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1918342684290215944',"Each week, we share stories from across our district of individuals whose embody the spirit of service, leadership, and community. This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of a true Hometown Hero‚Äîthe late Jack Erickson of Newtown, whom we sadly lost at the end of March. 

Jack did not just live in our community‚Äîhe helped shape it. For 96 remarkable years, he led with strength, purpose, and a commitment to serving others. A proud @USArmy veteran, Eagle Scout, and nationally awarded photographer, including a first-place honor from the National Press Photo Association in 1951, Jack captured history through his lens, photographing icons like Marilyn Monroe and President Truman. But his greatest legacy wasn‚Äôt who he photographed‚Äîit was how he lifted those around him. 

Following his military service, Jack built a successful business career, serving as Eastern Regional Sales Manager for Staley Manufacturing Company and later as President of the Bucks County Board of REALTORS Sales Division. However, his commitment to public service is what made the deepest and most lasting impact. Jack spent more than three decades helping preserve the history of Upper Makefield as a longtime member of the Historical Architectural Review Board. He twice led the Washington Crossing Rotary Club, lived out the motto ‚ÄúService Above Self,‚Äù helped launch the local Kiwanis Club, and served as president of the Pennsbury Scholarship Foundation, opening doors of opportunity for generations of students. He was also a proud 40-year member of the Newtown Reliance Company‚Äîhelping keep local traditions alive. 

Jack was a leader, a mentor, and a loyal friend. Whether championing education, supporting local preservation, or simply showing up when it mattered most, embodying his values through action. Although he never sought attention, he earned the admiration and gratitude of an entire community. At age 90, he was named Newtown‚Äôs Aging Athlete of the Year, a testament to the energy and spirit that defined him. Even later in life, he greeted each day with joy and optimism.

I recently led a congressional delegation to the Middle East and saw firsthand that we have partners who are ready and willing to work with us and with Israel to achieve this goal. However, Israel's current actions in Syria, Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon run the risk of making these efforts at stability in the region much more difficult to achieve.

Israel is blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza, enabling rapid settlement expansion and settler violence in the West Bank, and delegitimizing the new governments in Lebanon and Syria with military operations. I understand that Israel must defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas and other Iranian proxies, but these extremist groups thrive in chaos and are able to recruit and gain support where populations in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria and Lebanon continue to suffer in active war zones. The only long-term hope is for stable governments to emerge in these places.

Israel must immediately allow humanitarian assistance back into Gaza. It should do far more to stop settler violence in the West Bank, and, crucially, it must work with Arab partners in the region to support Palestinian leadership that can be an alternative to Hamas and give all the Palestinian people some hope for the future. Additionally, Israel's continued attacks on and occupations of land in Lebanon and Syria threaten to undermine the fragile, fledgling efforts of each to build new peaceful and stable governments.

Bringing a coalition of partners together as a deterrence to Iran is the only way out of this cycle of regional conflict that has been devastating to the civilian population. Israel must immediately let humanitarian aid in, stop legitimizing settlements in the West Bank, and halt military actions that continue to contribute to the chaos in the region.

I campaigned for no more foreign wars.

And now we are supposedly on the verge of going to war with Iran.

I don‚Äôt think we should be bombing foreign countries on behalf of other foreign countries especially when they have their own nuclear weapons and massive military strength. 

And on top of that, now we are told that we have signed a deal for mineral rights in Ukraine, in order to pay us back for the hundreds of billions of dollars that we gave Ukraine and they used for money laundering, sold the weapons we gave them to our enemies, and their leader is a dictator who canceled elections, was involved of the first impeachment of Trump, and campaigned for Biden.

Didn‚Äôt we learn our lesson when we went to war in Iraq and killed Saddam Hussein because of ‚Äúweapons of mass destruction?‚Äù
Did we ever find any? And did any of that oil over in the Middle East make us rich? The answer is no, we are $36 trillion in debt today. 

So why on earth would we go over and occupy Ukraine and spend an untold amount of future American taxpayer dollars defending and mining their minerals as well as potentially putting American lives at risk and future war?

Why don‚Äôt we just mine our own rare earth minerals that are tied up on federal lands that the government confiscated years ago? 

I also campaigned on accountability for the communist and tyrannical acts made by the government during Covid. Yet the Covid vaccine still has FDA approval even though there are millions reported injuries and deaths, and this mRNA vaccine is known to have horrific side effects and DOES NOT STOP PEOPLE FROM CATCHING COVID.
And to this day, it‚Äôs still on the childhood vaccine schedule, why on earth is this happening? Hasn‚Äôt big pharma made enough billions and billions and billions of dollars on this lie?

I also campaigned on accountability for all the law fair that was waged against the American people in the past four years. What about all the people that were locked up in jail and the abuse that they went through? And when are those vicious attorneys and judges ever going to be held accountable for the lives they ruined?

And I campaigned for an end to waste fraud and abuse of the American people‚Äôs harder tax dollars. I believe the DOGE mission is one of the most important things happening today in our government, and yet where are the rescissions that we should be voting on in Congress? 

And one of the biggest issues in the nation that I have fought for, and early on I was one of the only ones that took a loud screaming stand against, is the evil transgender assault against our children.  Most normal people in this country can‚Äôt even comprehend how it‚Äôs allowed to happen to kids who by law can‚Äôt even get a tattoo, drive, or vote. And how did so many of our teachers turn into the predators themselves that groom children with gender lies? This should be an all out effort by Republicans to end this insanity.

And look at the extreme nature of our rogue judicial system that is so defiant that there are judges that defy our nation‚Äôs laws and block the deportation of literal enemies of the United States of America. Where is the outrage and moral courage to dispose of this treason? Sadly not in Congress.

And what about election integrity? This should be the most important issue that the Republicans aggressively fight to protect because without secure elections protected from illegals voting and protections from stealing our votes, the American people have lost their power.

After a February announcement from the Department of Commerce that the program was being defunded, I contacted Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and the Trump administration to explain all that is at stake for Maine‚Äôs coastal communities with the loss of Sea Grant funding. After several productive conversations, Secretary Lutnick directed NOAA to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the work to be performed by Maine Sea Grant to ensure that it focuses on advancing Maine‚Äôs coastal economies, working waterfronts, and sustainable fisheries, and, this week, they received their funding.

I am thrilled that Maine Sea Grant has received its full funding so that the important work they do to conduct research, support a robust pipeline of skilled labor, and enrich our state‚Äôs economy can continue unimpeded. Maine Sea Grant has more than 700 established partnerships with businesses, researchers, community organizations, and local and county governments, and their work contributed to $23.5 million in documented economic benefits in 2023 alone.

Going forward, earning my vote for funding and policies will be defined by these issues:

1. I will not vote to fund a single penny or bullet to Ukraine regardless of a useless mineral deal that the American people do not care about or want. 
Write the several hundred billion off as a loss instead of permanently injecting ourselves into a never ending blank check and geopolitical disaster that the American people do not support or even care about. Haven‚Äôt enough been slaughtered? Let‚Äôs mine our own rare Earth resources, we are rich either them, and create American jobs.

And add Iran. Let the countries in that region of the world deal with them as they choose. Not America, we have an enemy that has literally been murdering, raping, and stealing from Americans for years. I‚Äôve never seen a Houthi, but I‚Äôve seen and heard the horror and heartbreak from American families about their family members murdered by the Cartel‚Äôs crimes and drugs.

If we can post on social media that we are going to bomb Iran, why would we hesitate or ask permission from Mexico to take out the organizations that enrich themselves by tens of billions every year by murder, rape, drug trafficking, and human and child sex trafficking? 

2. I will not vote to fund a CDC that keeps the failed and dangerous mRNA Covid vaccines on the childhood vaccine schedule. Aren‚Äôt children being injected with enough poisons? Why does this continue? 

3. I will not vote to fund reconciliation and tax law that raises taxes on hard working small business owners and does not include the President‚Äôs tax campaign promises of NO tax on tips, overtime, and social security. For the love of God, give the American people and those who have suffered and worked the hardest a break. 

4. Make the DOGE cuts permanent. This is one of the most important patriotic efforts to gut the bloated and failing federal government of extreme and outrageous corruption, fraud, waste, and putrid spending. 

5. I will not vote for a single penny to fund any thing that is involved in the trans agenda and child abusive medical industry that lies to children about their gender and sexuality and performs any level of sex changes on minors. There are only two genders, male and female, created in the image of GOD. We must stop this evil.

6. No federal funding for abortion and any entity involved in organ harvesting of dead and murdered babies. Period.

""Kathy Hochul‚Äôs criminal-first Parole Board is considering parole for a violent criminal thug who threw a brave NYPD cop off a Times Square roof. This is a disgusting betrayal of law enforcement and law-abiding New Yorkers.

Only in Kathy Hochul‚Äôs New York would such a vile criminal get another shot at freedom. Hochul puts criminals first and brave law enforcement and New Yorkers dead last. Hochul‚Äôs failure to fire soft-on-crime Parole Board members fuels this outrage, letting dangerous felons threaten our streets.

As Governor, Hochul has the power to remove these commissioners for cause yet she refuses to clean house. Her weak leadership emboldens criminals and endangers our communities.

This week: the Bipartisan PFAS Task Force.

As Co-Chair and Founding Member, I‚Äôm leading a national, bipartisan effort to confront the PFAS crisis head-on‚Äîbecause no one should have to question whether their water, homes, or schools are safe.

Today, I officially relaunched the Task Force for the 119th Congress and welcomed new Co-Chairs: @RepDebDingell, @RepJenKiggans, & @repkmr. Together, we‚Äôre turning PFAS issues into action.

Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre advancing this mission: ‚¨áÔ∏è

‚úîÔ∏è Driving bipartisan legislation like the PFAS-Free Procurement Act, which I just introduced last week to reduce harmful chemical exposure by prohibiting federal contracts for products containing PFOS and PFOA
‚úîÔ∏è Securing historic federal investments in PFAS research, remediation, and prevention
‚úîÔ∏è Educating Congress and the public on the severe health and environmental risks 
‚úîÔ∏è Holding polluters accountable and pushing for comprehensive cleanup
‚úîÔ∏è Protecting communities across the country, where families have lived in danger for far too long

PFAS is linked to cancer, liver damage, and developmental harm‚Äîand the science is clear: these chemicals have no place in our future.

"Hern, Kevin",Representative,Oklahoma,1,Republican,House: 2018-Present,Yes,repkevinhern,'1919758736307974389',"In Oklahoma, we know about energy.

Oklahoma is home to major players in the oil & gas industry - in fact, Tulsa was once the oil capital of the world. But did you know that Oklahoma is also one of the leading states in renewable energy as well?

That's because we understand that we need both. Solar and wind, so-called 'green' energy sources, are great. But we can't rely on them full-time. That's why we're always going to need nuclear power, natural gas, and coal. These traditional energy sources are reliable and provide Americans with accessible, affordable, dependable energy.

The recent power outages across Spain and Portugal prove this point. You don't need to go all-in on any one or the other. An all-of-the-above approach guarantees reliable energy access.

The whole world can learn a lesson from these blackouts: virtue signaling to the climate lobby will come at the expense of your power grid.

We discussed the need for river roads so Border Patrol agents can access remote areas safely and efficiently. I also raised concerns about Carrizo cane, which blocks visibility and hampers patrol efforts along the river.

I highlighted the urgency of updating surveillance technology, streamlining the procurement process, and deploying more AST towers. Too many areas along the border still lack coverage, putting our agents at greater risk.

I also pressed for new investments in scanning technology at our ports of entry - where most contraband comes through - and shared concerns about potential cuts to @CBP pensions that would hurt our frontline personnel.

üö®This historic drug bust led to the arrest of six people living in our country illegally who were running a massive drug operation. 

üö®The @DEAHQ seized a total of:
-11.5 kilos of fentanyl, including 3 million fentanyl pills ‚Äì stamped as oxycodone
-$5 million in cash
-35 kilos of meth
-7.5 kilos of cocaine
-4.5 kilos of heroin
-49 rifles and pistols

As a result of the federal investigation, DEA arrested one of the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel in Oregon, and seized illicit drugs in New Mexico, Arizona & Utah.

75,000 Americans have been dying of fentanyl-related overdose deaths each year. Fentanyl-related overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 34. 

Since @POTUS took office in January 2025, nearly 30 million fentanyl-laced pills have already been seized, protecting our communities and keeping these deadly pills from reaching the hands of our loved ones.
