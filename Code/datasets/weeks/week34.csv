It also takes long-overdue steps to root out fraud and waste in the SNAP program by reining in the bureaucratic abuse that‚Äôs allowed states like California to hand out benefits to able-bodied adults with no work requirements and who don‚Äôt meet the federal requirements, all while taxpayers foot the bill.

The bill has improvements to agriculture programs as well, including making crop insurance work better. A working crop insurance program that protects farmers also reduces the need for supplemental disaster costs‚Äîprotecting farmers and taxpayers at the same time. We also improved programs for our specialty crops in California such as almonds, walnuts, pistachios, prunes, peaches, olives, and many others.

This is a strong step forward‚Äîsupporting those who truly need help, restoring fairness for rural counties, and bringing a little more common sense to Washington.",en,Tweet,2,11,6,11,1241.0,2025-05-15 16:41:51,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Once passed, the TRAVEL Act will empower the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to appoint traveling physicians to aid underserved communities like the Marianas and improve healthcare access for our veterans.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1923418134142243053',"Each week, we shine a light on a Hometown Hero‚Äîsomeone whose service, sacrifice, or spirit reflects the very best of our PA-1 community.
 
But this week, we don‚Äôt honor just one. We honor every man and woman who has ever worn the badge to protect and serve our neighborhoods. Because every officer who puts on the uniform, every deputy who answers the call, every trooper who runs toward the danger, they are all Hometown Heroes.
 
National Police Week is a solemn reminder that behind every badge is a person willing to risk everything for someone they may never meet. A neighbor. A stranger. A child. A community. And in our community, we have felt that sacrifice deeply. Since 1898, sixteen of our own have laid down their lives while protecting Bucks County:

PA Deputy Constable Erwin Mondeau, 1898
PA Constable Henry Kolbe, 1914
Bucks County Sheriff Abram Kulp, 1927
Quakertown Boro Officer Edward Shearer, 1936
Dublin Boro Chief Eli Myers, 1965
Bristol Township Detective George Stuckey, 1972
Bensalem Township Officer James Armstrong, 1975
Bensalem Township Officer Robert Yezzi, 1980
Bucks County Deputy Sheriff Thomas Bateman, 1986
Bucks County Deputy Sheriff George Warta, Jr., 1986
Bucks County Ranger Stanley Flynn, 1993
Plumstead Township Officer Joseph Hanusey III, 2002
Newtown Borough Officer Brian Gregg, 2005
Middletown Township Detective Christopher Jones, 2009
Bucks County Ranger Thomas Booz, 2020
Warrington Township K9 Officer Stephen Plum, 2022
 
They wore different uniforms, served different towns, but shared a common mission: to keep our PA-1 community safe, no matter the cost.
 
Officer Brian Gregg, just 46 years old, was shot and killed by a drunk driving suspect he was standing guard over. Detective Chris Jones, just 37, was struck and killed by a drunk driver while conducting a routine traffic stop. Officer Joe Hanusey, just 30, a rising star, earned the Top Gun Award for most DUI arrests in Pennsylvania and poured his heart into Plumstead‚Äôs Youth Aid Panel, giving first-time offenders a second chance and mentoring our young people toward a better path. And Officer Stephen Plum, just 38, a proud U.S. Marine Corps veteran, died of a heart attack shortly after responding to a tense barricade situation; his final act was one of protection.
 
These men didn‚Äôt just serve‚Äîthey embodied what it means to be a Hometown Hero. Their memory lives on not only in our words but in our actions. So, please join our community this Monday, May 19, at 7:00 p.m. at St. Andrew Catholic Church in Newtown for the annual Bucks County Police Memorial Ceremony to celebrate their service and sacrifice.
 
And while we honor their memory, and the memory of all the PA-1 residents who wore the badge and gave their lives while serving other communities, we must stand with those still serving. Every day, our officers quietly sacrifice‚Äîmissing holidays, bearing unseen burdens, stepping into danger‚Äîbecause they believe in duty, community, and something greater than themselves. As a former FBI Special Agent, I‚Äôve seen their courage up close. I know what they carry‚Äîand I will never stop fighting to ensure they have what they need: resources, training, support, and the respect they‚Äôve earned.
 
And let‚Äôs carry that spirit forward. Let‚Äôs make every week Police Week. A handshake, a kind word, a show of support‚Äîsmall acts that remind our officers they are not alone.
 
To the families of the fallen: your loved ones are never forgotten. And to all those who have served or are still serving: we thank you and we stand with you‚Äîtoday and always.
 
May God bless our law enforcement officers, their families, and our beloved Bucks County.",en,Tweet,0,10,2,1,1067.0,2025-05-16 17:39:53,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrFamMlX0AQ03Ee.jpg

SALT caps at $30,000 is for Lawler‚Äôs district allows 93% of his constituents to write off their entire property tax bill!

Lawler can win re-election on that and the $30,000 SALT caps is even better than the measly $20,000 SALT cap he put in his own legislation. ¬†

He should be saying thank you to all of us from red states that are supporting the SALT caps being raised to $30,000 to help his constituents in his terrible blue states.

But instead he is grandstanding and refusing to vote for the most important legislation that we can accomplish this term.¬† The tax law is about to expire and that will raise taxes 65% on everyone. ¬†

Then we have the other wing of our conference who just voted NO in the budget committee mark up on the reconciliation budget.¬† 

The Freedom Caucus now refuses to vote for the bid beautiful bill because it doesn‚Äôt cut Medicaid enough.

This group, Clyde, Roy, Norman, and Brecheen are all in nice red seats and I think they are screwing things up just as badly as RINO Mike Lawler.

I would argue that it is all of them that don‚Äôt appreciate our majority like I do!

I just want to pass the big beautiful bill, Trump‚Äôs EOs, and DOGE rescission cuts and win, win, win!!

Then we can do another reconciliation bill and hopefully get another bite at the apple to win some more!

But I do.

Because I was there with them.

It wasn‚Äôt SALT caps or Medicaid cuts.¬†

It was NO tax on tips, overtime, social security, closing the border and stopping innocent American‚Äôs like¬†Laken Rileys from being murdered, lowering inflation to make life affordable for the average American who can no longer afford it, ending the never ending foreign wars, and Making America Healthy Again.¬† It was MAGA and America First.

Congress has to stop repeating history‚Äîwe know that keeping wind and solar credits in this bill will drain taxpayers, offshore American jobs, and prevent American energy dominance. President Trump has been clear: it‚Äôs time to end the Green New Scam. That means now, not later. Our ‚Äúno‚Äù vote in committee yesterday was a necessary stand to force this change.

As it is currently drafted, the House‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äù keeps many of the Democrats‚Äô Green New Scam tax subsidies in place‚Äîlike wind and solar credits‚Äîfor nearly two more decades, until 2041. The so-called ‚Äúphase out‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even begin until after President Trump‚Äôs term ends.

As this article makes clear, delaying a Green New Scam repeal until 2029‚Äîor later‚Äîrisks locking these subsidies in permanently. Every year they remain, the green lobby gets richer, more established, and harder to defeat.

These subsidies are propping up Chinese industry at the expense of American workers. In 2024, solar accounted for 61% of all new U.S. electric generation‚Äîdriven by federal handouts. China dominates the global solar supply chain, so we are effectively using American tax dollars to subsidize Chinese manufacturing. Meanwhile, affordable, reliable U.S. natural gas and coal‚Äîand the jobs they support‚Äîare pushed aside.

Oklahoma is a top-five natural gas exporter. We know firsthand that grid instability, job loss, and dependence on China have no place in a Republican energy bill. We must repeal these subsidies ASAP‚Äînot in 2029.

Standing in the heart of a city older than the nation itself, I was proud to recognize the people and partnerships that made this day possible. From Mayor Dr. Victor Trevi√±o‚Äôs leadership to the tireless efforts of the Webb County Heritage Foundation and Andrea Ordo√±ez. Together with educators, cultural groups, and everyday citizens, they remind us that history lives on through the people who carry it forward.

Laredo is not just a border town. It is a borderland civilization. A city where seven flags have flown, where commerce and culture meet, and where generations have grown up bilingual, proud, and deeply rooted.

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1924079387848179732',"There is a lot of confusion about the big beautiful bill and understandably so.

If I had it my way, Congress would be forced to pass a balanced budget every single year and if we didn‚Äôt then we would not be eligible for re-election!

But clearly I don‚Äôt have it my way because Congress is a majority ruled legislature.

The big beautiful bill is a special type of budget called reconciliation that can pass the House by majority and Senate, meaning that it can pass in the Senate with 51 votes and not have to stand up under the 60 vote rule. And there are a lot of rules about what can go in and what can‚Äôt go in this reconciliation budget bill. I don‚Äôt make the rules. I‚Äôm just explaining it so that hopefully it helps you understand why it doesn‚Äôt contain things that I want passed immediately and should‚Äôve been done already in the House and the Senate like the very important DOGE cuts.

So we have three types of legislation that we can pass in the House that passes President Trump‚Äòs agenda. 

1. The reconciliation bill that Trump wants and named The Big Beautiful Bill. This is essentially an omnibus that prioritizes spending on border security, energy, and the tax bill. This will fund the federal government and prioritize spending to match policies that the Trump administration is asking the House and Senate to pass. It is going to be expensive and the White House is working closely with the House and Senate on what is in this bill. This is not a federal reduction bill, it‚Äôs a federal funding bill. If we don‚Äôt pass this, the tax law will expire and taxes will be increased by 65% on most Americans. It also funds two of our top priorities - border security and deportations and American energy and destroying the Green New Deal. Again don‚Äôt shoot the messenger, I‚Äôm just explaining it to you and not sugar coating it.

2. DOGE cuts also called rescissions. These can be passed separately or in one big package. Personally, I would like to be passing them every single week. I don‚Äôt know why we can‚Äôt pass DOGE cuts like defunding studies of the sex lives of shrimp each week. I think DOGE cuts are extremely important because this is how we reduce the size and scope of the behemoth, the federal government. 

3. President Trump‚Äôs Executive Orders. The House and the Senate can vote to pass legislation that would codify into law President Trump‚Äòs executive orders. He has now signed over 150 EOs. I would love to see all 150+ past. But if I were you, I wouldn‚Äôt get your hopes up that that will happen because after all this is Washington DC that never really does the well of the people. Sadly, and I‚Äôm just being honest not that I support that. I support doing the will of the people.

Here is what I am being told between the House and the White House. 

They told me that once we finish with reconciliation, President Trump‚Äòs big beautiful bill, that we will be passing DOGE cuts. OMB is going to send a rescission package to House Appropriations Committee. Again, I would like to be doing them every single week, but they are planning to do them in a package as far as I have been told.

Also, they told me that the executive orders will come through House committees. I don‚Äôt have details on the timing of that but will try to find out. 

Lastly, getting 218 Republicans to vote together is like herding cats. And it‚Äôs a lot more complicated when the Republicans, who never supported President Trump until the very end of the campaign when they had to because he was beating everyone, are all standing on their own little hills in their own little castles defending their own little kingdoms instead of fighting together.

And when spending bills are over spending instead of being a balanced budget a little bit over spending is the same as being a little bit pregnant. The reality is over spending is over spending. If there was a real fight for a balanced budget I would be leading it, and it would be worth it.

Until then, DOGE cuts!",en,Tweet,461,11069,2777,1900,249925.0,2025-05-18 13:27:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration delivered last week:

During a House budget hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said ""I don't think people should be taking advice--medical advice--from me.""

President Trump worked hard trying to convince us that not accepting a $400 million plane from Qatar that he wants to use as Air Force One and then transfer to his eventual library would be dumb. Congress has to approve gifts to all Presidents but Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said this was ""not in my lane.""

After summarily firing the Librarian of Congress and then the head of the U.S. Copyright Office, the Trump administration is attempting a hostile takeover of the Library of Congress, a part of the legislative branch. Unknown to most people outside of the Washington bubble is the fact that the Library's sub-agencies are the ones that give confidential legal advice to members of Congress while also overseeing and preserving all copyrighted material in the nation. Trump and Elon Musk want access to that information and data.

We learned that the architect of Project 2025, Russell Vought, will be taking over DOGE when Musk's tenure as a special government employee expires. Vought is the same person who believes the nation is experiencing a ""Marxist takeover"" and promised to put career civil servants ""in trauma.""

American intelligence officials released a report confirming that the Venezuelan government is not controlling the Tren de Aragua gang's operations in the United States. President Trump's assertion the gang works in concert with the Venezuelan government and has invaded our nation is how he rationalized invoking the Alien Enemies Act. And the authors of the report were quickly fired by DNI Gabbard.

Falsely claiming a genocide against white South African farmers, President Trump granted refugee status to and flew a group of Afrikaners to the US on a State Department-chartered plane with plans to resettle them here using federal resources. The president suspended humanitarian admissions of all other refugees immediately after taking office in January.

Homeland Secretary head Kristi Noem announced the end of temporary protected status for Afghan refugees in the U.S., many of whom worked with us and saved the lives of American troops in Afghanistan. Our forcing them to return to a nation where they are considered enemies of the state undermines, to say the least, our military's ability to work collaboratively with locals in future conflicts.

"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1924216512862449927',"From @WSJ: ‚ÄúRoy and other Republicans say the current plan misses a rare chance to alter the nation‚Äôs red-ink trajectory by reducing spending on growing social safety-net programs. They want Medicaid work requirements to start sooner than 2029, as the current bill does. The spending hawks also want faster removal of clean-energy tax credits, which the current bill phases out over several years. They warn that the bill, as written, front-loads tax cuts in the next few years and delays spending cuts. That combination, they argue, means that budget deficits could be significantly higher in the short run.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrecheen is particularly focused on the clean-energy tax credits and wants them eliminated as soon as possible. He opposes the provision in the bill that keeps some partial credits in place for projects placed in service as late as 2031 and warned that lobbyists would push a future Congress to keep wind and solar tax breaks alive.‚Äù

We must address the solar and wind tax credits now. If they are allowed to linger, we risk our electric grid becoming entirely dependent on subsidized, unreliable energy. China manufactures most of the solar components we continue to use, meaning we are subsidizing Chinese industry. This threatens American jobs and displaces reliable natural gas.

Assuming the state had a 75% FMAP, the state would then receive $15 million in federal Medicaid matching funds (75% of $20 million).

As a result:

- hospitals would gain $10 million ($20 million in increased Medicaid payments minus $10 million in tax payments),

President Trump was absolutely inspiring, always witty, and emphasized the importance of passing what he has named the Big Beautiful Bill. 

The bill is a plan, a framework with initiatives for national security, economic strength, and in fact, world stability. This bill will secure the border even further through legislation so it cannot be overturned in the future. It will make us energy dominant again, will restore our military, and make our American economy the most competitive in the world. 

But in the same note, I believe this reconciliation bill is only the beginning‚Äîwhen it‚Äôs done, it will only be five to six months into the President‚Äôs four year term.

Oversight Hearing: Surveillance in Private Spaces

Liberty begins with the right to close a door. A hidden camera kicks that door off its hinges.

The Constitution‚Äôs Fourth Amendment enshrines a ‚Äúreasonable expectation of privacy‚Äù. Yet today, that freedom is violated by secret cameras and hidden devices to record women and girls with impunity.

Freedom is not a theory; it is the right to breathe, to dress and undress, to sleep without someone‚Äôs camera filming your naked body. The Founders wrote liberty in parchment; hidden cameras erase it in pixels.

I speak not just as a lawmaker, but as a survivor. Starting on November 5, 2023, I discovered my former fianc√©, Patrick Bryant, had filmed women without their knowledge, without their permission and without their consent.

He filmed rape too.

He appeared to catalogue the footage in the way he saved the files. And he stored these images for years.

This isn‚Äôt just creepy. It‚Äôs criminal‚Äîbut only under weak state laws.

In South Carolina, first-time voyeurs face a misdemeanor and a small $500 fine. That‚Äôs not justice. That‚Äôs betrayal.

Real men guard a woman‚Äôs privacy; predators harvest it.

When predators install covert cameras or forge explicit images, they do not invade a room, they invade a life, and that life deserves more than a misdemeanor.

Exhibit 1: A screenshot of my naked silhouette‚Äîfilmed in secret. The camera sat silent, yet it screamed my safety was negotiable and my dignity disposable.

Exhibit 2: An image of the building where women were recorded. [Enter into the record the Deed and short term rental documents.]

Exhibit 3: Screenshot. Just one camera I found had 10,633 videos saved on it at one point.

Exhibit 4: Screenshot. Evidence Bryant was transferring data off his phone‚Äîthousands of files.

He seemed to have certain fetishes of the women he catalogued: as they stood at the end of his bed undressed, sexual intercourse I‚Äôm very specific places in front of his hidden camera, and in specific positions, while they were changing, genital areas of women at the beach and pool, and at least one rape victim while she was unconscious.

He would even save a headshot of the victim next to a series of images of their private parts.

He kept the images for YEARS. One series of upskirt photos, he saved for almost ten years.

Exhibit 5: Various images of women filmed and photographed without their knowledge, their bodies redacted to protect their identity. I discovered up to four recording devices.

Exhibit 6: Screenshot. Rape victim unconscious. (with her face blurred, and with her permission).

These weren‚Äôt accidents. They were premeditated. Planned. Filmed. Stored. Meticulously Organized. Categorized. Catalogued. Private hidden folder. For YEARS.

At least two potential victims told me they once saw one of his cameras and he denied he was recording.

I would learn after finding these images, and speaking to potential victims, Bryant allegedly raped atleast 3 women.

We face an enemy that records first and apologizes never.

When I spoke up, Bryant didn‚Äôt apologize. He retaliated.

In fact, Patrick Bryant has started the process of suing his victims. Myself included.

[Enter into the record 2 Preservation Letters redacting rape victims names and other names.]

So let me be crystal clear: I won‚Äôt be intimidated. And I won‚Äôt back down, not for myself, and absolutely not for the women he violated for YEARS.

Predators like Patrick Bryant don‚Äôt ask permission, and neither should justice. A hidden camera does not erase liberty and doesn‚Äôt deserve a slap on the wrist.

Justice also does not crawl out of a plea deal, it arrives in a sentence that fits the crime and restores the victim.

Justice should come in the form of real sentences, real fines, and real protection for victims.

That‚Äôs why I introduced:

The Sue VOYEURS Act, which creates a civil right of action for victims.

The Stop VOYEURS Act, which expands the narrow federal prohibition on video voyeurism.

Secret recordings thrive in the shadows. These bills drag them into broad daylight.

Liberty is not theory‚Äîit‚Äôs the right to undress in peace. To live unrecorded. Without being filmed while naked.

Let‚Äôs make sure the law reflects that truth. We need laws with teeth. We need survivors with standing. And we need to leave predators with nowhere left to hide.

Today, I choose daylight. I invite every member of this House to step into that light with me, to pass these bills, and to prove that in the digital age liberty still lives where Americans stand as our forefathers promised.

I encourage other potential victims to come forward. Potential victims may contact SLED‚Äôs lead investigator directly at: Haley Nelson, hnelson@sled.sc.gov.

A tipline also remains active with the Congresswoman‚Äôs office at 843.212.7048 for those who believe they may have been recorded, assaulted, or otherwise victimized by these predators.

I would run through a brick wall to protect women and girls in South Carolina.

To other potential victims, I want you to know, ‚ÄúI have your back.‚Äù

Why require proof of citizenship to get a job and not require the same verification to vote?

In Utah, California, and 17 other states, illegal immigrants can receive a drivers license.

What is to stop these illegal immigrants from checking the box saying they are a citizen and registering to vote? Nothing. Indeed, the Supreme Court found--wrongly, in my view--that states are forbidden from requiring proof of citizenship during registration.

This needs to change. 

Elections sometimes come down to ‚Äúexceedingly, exceedingly, exceedingly‚Äù small margins.

These are illegal population numbers from Pew Research, as of 2022‚Äìand remember, they further exploded during Joe Biden‚Äôs presidency!
 
Pew estimated 1.4% of Wisconsin‚Äôs population is here illegally. The presidential race there was decided by a 0.8% margin.

In Nevada, 5.8% of the state‚Äôs population is here illegally. The last presidential race was decided by a 3.1% margin.

In Georgia, the estimate is 3.4% are here illegally. The last Presidential election was decided by a 2.2% margin.

In Pennsylvania the estimate is 1.8% here illegally. The last presidential election was decided by a 1.7% margin.

In North Carolina the estimate is 3% here illegally. The last presidential race was decided by a 3.2% margin.

In Michigan the estimate is 1.3% here illegally. The last presidential race was decided by a 1.4% margin.
