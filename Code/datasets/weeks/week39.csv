"Moore, Blake D.",Representative,Utah,1,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepBlakeMoore,'1935490460522263009',"The security environment in the Middle East is rapidly changing as we speak. I‚Äôm hesitant to offer definitive analysis in a time of such uncertainty, but here are a few core observations of mine from the past few days:
1) Israel‚Äôs clear-eyed decision to strike and dismantle a rogue Iranian nuclear program, one that was censured by UN authorities last week for breaching the Non-Proliferation Treaty, is firmly within the U.S. national interest. It‚Äôs a good thing that Iran‚Äôs ability to threaten the U.S., Israel, and our other allies with the nuclear weapon has now been degraded.

2) I‚Äôm glad that the White House has made clear that they are prioritizing the safety of our servicemembers in the region and the 500,000+ Americans living in Israel. They do not want to spark a wider regional war, and neither do I.

3) Conventional air superiority still reigns supreme. Drones/unmanned tech will continue to play a major role in the future of warfare but, as we saw, they cannot replace fifth generation aircraft. Utahns know this well with Hill Air Force Base being home to the nation‚Äôs first active duty F-35 wing. 

4) There is a quietly-growing consensus from our European and Arab partners that the best possible outcome is one where Iran can no longer possess a nuclear weapon. This consensus is long overdue.

5) Lastly, I realize this would be very difficult to achieve with the Ayotollah‚Äôs firm grip on power and the IRGC‚Äôs omnipresence, but I desperately hope this conflict leads to an opportunity for the amazing Iranian people to recapture a voice within their government and create more of their own destiny.",en,Tweet,1,18,2,32,21304.0,2025-06-19 01:11:00,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Texas already runs one of the most efficient Medicaid programs in the country. These GOP cuts could strip up to $55 billion in funding, threaten 142,000 healthcare jobs, and severely impact rural hospitals, many of which already operate at a loss.

Today, we shine a light on a man who has exemplified that spirit every day for the last 35 years. Meet this week's Hometown Hero: Lieutenant John Michniewicz of the Middletown Township Police Department.

Lieutenant Michniewicz began his law enforcement journey in 1990, graduating from the Philadelphia Police Academy with a clear and unwavering mission: to serve and protect our community. Over the next three and a half decades, he became a cornerstone of the Middletown Township Police Department‚Äîrising through the ranks as Patrolman, K-9 Officer, Detective, Sergeant, and ultimately Lieutenant. In every role, he led by example, bringing a deep sense of duty, professionalism, and compassion that elevated the entire department and set a lasting standard for those who served alongside him.
 
This week, I had the honor of joining MTPD To celebrate Lieutenant Michniewicz as he prepares to retire after 35 years of distinguished service. As someone who works closely with our law enforcement officers day in and day out, I witness the strength, sacrifice, and dedication it takes to protect our communities, and Lieutenant Michniewicz embodies all of that and more. He has not only earned the respect of his fellow officers but also the trust and admiration of our entire community. His leadership, steady presence, and unwavering commitment to public safety have left a lasting mark on Middletown, and his legacy will continue to guide the department for years to come.
 
Beyond his day-to-day service, Lieutenant Michniewicz played a critical role in preparing the department for the future. He conducted countless background investigations to ensure recruits met the highest standards of character and professionalism. He also made a strong commitment to developing his professional leadership, graduating from some of the most respected law enforcement programs in the country, including Northwestern University‚Äôs School of Police Staff and Command, the Police Executive Research Forum‚Äôs Senior Management Institute, and the FBI‚Äôs Executive Development Program.

I am concerned that the current war could rapidly spiral into a broader war in the Middle East, with grave consequences for regional stability and American lives.

But let‚Äôs be clear: the authority to declare war belongs solely to the United States Congress. President Trump does not have congressional approval to take offensive military action against Iran.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve signed onto the bipartisan War Powers resolution to prohibit U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran war without congressional approval.

I have called on Speaker Johnson to immediately reconvene the House to respond to possible military action in Iran. He must also immediately convene a classified congressional briefing on the escalating conflict.

But let‚Äôs remember how we got here: although imperfect, the Obama administration negotiated a nuclear agreement that successfully and verifiably prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. President Trump recklessly withdrew from that deal, removing restrictions and giving Iran a green light to resume its nuclear ambitions.

Let's take a look at who he appointed to replace them. üßµ 

Dr. Joseph R. Hibbeln, who has no professional track record at all with vaccines.

Martin Kulldorff objected to mass vaccinations for COVID-19, and himself neglected to get one. He was later dismissed by Mass General Brigham and fired from Harvard Medical School. He's also accepted over $30,000 in return for testifying against vaccines. 

Dr. Retsef Levi, a professor at MIT, has used his profile to call for the termination of COVID vaccines, wrongly claiming they caused a record number of deaths.  

Dr. Robert Malone claimed the American people got COVID-19 vaccinations because they were, in part, hypnotized. He inaccurately said some of those vaccinated then developed AIDS. 

Despite being on the FDA panel that approved COVID vaccines, Dr. Cody Meissner has argued repeatedly against children receiving them. He criticized children wearing masks during COVID, even though the practice saved lives.  

Dr. Michael A. Ross is an OB-GYN and a board member for a supplement company. He has no public vaccine experience at all. 

Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician, has no public professional experience with vaccines.

Finally, Vicky Pebsworth volunteered as a director for a medical group spreading widespread misinformation on vaccines.

The federal funds, with $1 million for Webb County and $1 million for Zapata County, were awarded to @nwlaredo to weatherize and repair dozens of homes in rural communities like El Cenizo, Rio Bravo, Mirando City, and Oilton. These critical renovations lower utility costs, increase accessibility through ADA-compliant upgrades, and provide safe, livable housing for families who too often lack access to home improvement resources.

As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I was proud to secure this funding through the Community Project Funding process. In Webb County, Phase 1 of the project is already complete, with 17 homes repaired in El Cenizo and Rio Bravo. Phase 2 is now in progress, with work underway in Mirando City and Oilton.

This investment is more than just construction. It is about ensuring dignity, safety, and long-term savings for families in need.

Engaging in direct conflict places U.S. service members and military sites in the Middle East squarely in the crosshairs of Iran and its many proxies. Tonight‚Äôs actions could further escalate tensions, destabilize the region, and drag the United States into an avoidable war.

The way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and to protect American service members is through diplomacy and negotiation, not entering into direct conflict.

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1936844893655020017',"My thoughts on bombing Iran.

I don‚Äôt know anyone in America who has been the victim of a crime or killed by Iran, but I know many people who have been victims of crime committed by criminal illegal aliens or MURDERED by Cartel and Chinese fentanyl/drugs. 

Almost everyone in our country can relate to this fact. 

However America has not dropped bunker busters on the Cartel‚Äôs sophisticated drug tunnels, launched tomahawks on massive cartel poisonous drug operations, or gone to war against the cartels international terrorists networks.

Neocon warmongers beat their drums of war and act like Billy badasses going to war in countries most Americans have never seen and can‚Äôt find on a map, but never find the courage to go to war against the actual terrorists who actually do kill Americans, invade our land, and make BILLIONS doing it day after day, year after year.

I‚Äôm 51 years old. I‚Äôm GenX. 

I‚Äôve watched our country go to war in foreign lands for foreign causes on behalf of foreign interests for as long as I can remember. I was in 10th grade when Desert Storm started and my father before me was sent to Vietnam, another senseless foreign war. 

America is $37 TRILLION in debt and all of these foreign wars have cost Americans TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS of dollars that never benefited any American.

American troops have been killed and forever torn apart physically and mentally for regime change, foreign wars, and for military industrial base profits. 

I‚Äôm sick of it. 

I can easily say I support nuclear armed Israel‚Äôs right to defend themselves and also say at the same time I don‚Äôt want to fight or fund nuclear armed Israel‚Äôs wars. 

Nor any other country for that matter. 

I‚Äôm sick of funding foreign aid and foreign countries and foreign everything. 

I want to fund American interests and issues.

I want GREAT trade deals so American businesses and people can afford goods and be successful.

I want low inflation and low interest rates.

I want American construction, housing, and manufacturing to BOOM.

I want Americans to be rich and have security in their future.

I want my children‚Äôs generation to HAVE A GREAT FUTURE!!!

My kids are 22, 25, and 27. 

It pisses me off beyond comprehension that my children‚Äôs generation can‚Äôt afford to buy a house, can‚Äôt afford insurance, and have little hope for their future!!! 

Americans are exhausted by all of this and rightfully so. 

I can also support President Trump and his great administration on many of the great things they are doing while disagreeing on bombing Iran and getting involved in a hot war that Israel started.

That‚Äôs not disloyalty. Critical thinking and having my own opinions is the most American thing ever.

Because contrary to what brainwashed Democrat boomers say, Trump is not a king, MAGA is not a cult, and President Trump has surrounded himself with people who once disagreed with him and even ran against him for President.

Also the same Democrats in Congress that are all of sudden clutching their pearls about Trump bombing Iran FULLY SUPPORTED AND VOTED TO FUND Dementia ridden Biden‚Äôs proxy war against Russia in Ukraine and stood by Biden‚Äôs disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Hypocrites is all they are and they are just desperately trying to find solid ground to oppose Trump on because so far they‚Äôve failed at grasping anything yet.

Now what has been done is done and Americans now fear Iranian terrorists attacks on our own soil and being dragged into another war by Netanyahu when we weren‚Äôt even thinking about any of this a week ago.

We don‚Äôt know what the future holds and I pray for the safety of all people and an end to the constant demand for America to go to war.

Our troops always deserve our respect, no matter who is president.

I never for a second doubted our military's ability to strike its targets. But taking out facilities is the easy part. It's what comes next that's hard-and we've seen how this story goes.

Launching airstrikes without consulting Congress, without a clear strategy, and without providing transparency to the American people is not an acceptable path forward. I am also extremely worried that the massive risk of escalation will further put our service members at risk.

If we desire peace in the region, we can never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. It would be incredibly naive to believe that if Iran obtained a nuclear weapon that they would not use it. But the Administration has an obligation to brief Congress and outline their objectives for the timing of this action. We cannot be dragged into another war in the Middle East by those who have learned nothing from the last two decades.

Iran is run by a terrorist regime who has unequivocally stated their intention to develop nuclear weapons in order to destroy Israel.  

The Iranian regime has also repeatedly stated their next target - should they succeed in defeating Israel - will be America.  

Rule number one in self defense:  when someone threatens the lives of you and your family, believe them; and, then do everything in your power to prevent it. 

The previous Administration didn‚Äôt understand that basic principle and their policy of appeasement was received by allies and enemies alike as weakness, which only emboldened Iran to accelerate their nuclear power ambitions.

President Trump doesn‚Äôt want war, but peace requires a willing partner.  The Iranian regime has shown no change in policy or posture including ending their nuclear weapons program, killing American troops, funding terrorists in the region, and supporting Hamas‚Äô October 2023 terrorist attack on Israel.

Iran mistook Trump‚Äôs reluctance for war as an unwillingness to use force.  Now they know.  If Iran doesn‚Äôt come to the table soon or decides to strike American targets, President Trump‚Äôs patience for diplomacy will quickly expire.

Iran is a terrorist state that must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon, a development that would threaten American national security and the very existence of our ally, Israel. In the wake of the strike on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, I call on the Trump Administration to re-engage in diplomacy and prioritize the safety of all American service members and civilians in the region.

Granite Staters do not want our country to be drawn into another endless war in the Middle East. It is the role of Congress to consider and approve the deployment of U.S. military power to wage war, not a unilateral decision to be made by the President. That is why the administration must come to Congress immediately to answer questions about this attack and present a plan to protect our service members and national security interests.

Administrations of both parties have, for too long, operated beyond the powers granted to them by the Constitution and the law. I have consistently argued during my time in office that Congress must reassert its authority to determine the appropriate use of military force and prevent the United States from getting bogged down in conflicts. That is why I will support H. Con. Res. 38 and will continue to review additional measures to restore this check and affirm the role of Congress to debate and approve future military action.",en,Tweet,3,7,2,15,3670.0,2025-06-23 16:53:18,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

These programs are lifelines for thousands of families in Arizona.

This is personal for me. When I was a kid, my three sisters and I relied on free lunch at school. That tray meant my mom could breathe a little easier and I could just be a kid.

That‚Äôs what Republicans in Congress are threatening to rip away from tens of thousands of kids in Arizona. These are kids who don‚Äôt have a lobbyist and who didn‚Äôt ask to be caught in a political fight but got caught in one anyway.

I'm not being dramatic; this isn‚Äôt a hypothetical. Under the budget that House Republicans narrowly passed last month, 63,000 Arizona families are at risk of losing some or all of their SNAP benefits. Kicking kids off SNAP will also make it harder for schools to qualify for federal school meal funding, impacting 121,693 Arizona students.

These cuts aren‚Äôt just bad policy. They‚Äôre a moral failure.

The United States is the richest country in the history of the world. We shouldn‚Äôt accept moms opening the fridge and having to decide who skips dinner like it‚Äôs normal. We shouldn‚Äôt accept second graders sitting through math class on an empty stomach. We have enough to make sure kids in Arizona get lunch at school and that families can put food on the table. We just have to decide that‚Äôs what matters.

The Roadless Rule was never about responsible conservation; it was about bureaucratic overreach that undermined the ability of local forest managers and communities to effectively manage their lands.

I‚Äôve been involved with the challenges of Middle East for nearly 30 yrs. Donald Trump‚Äôs handling of Iran has been a masterclass in Presidential Leadership of historic proportions. Not only has the nuclear threat of a messianic regime been significantly diminished, new opportunities for regional peace have been opened. (I say this even if fighting resumes with assorted splinter factions of the Iranian IRCG). From Sulamani, to the Abraham Accords to the nuke lab strike, President Trump has displayed bold, strategic and region changing leadership. 
2. While I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic about the ceasefire due to the severe degradation of Iran‚Äôs military and terrorist proxies, the ongoing threat of virulent radical Islamic terrorism from significant elements should not be minimized in the days, months and years ahead. We must maintain vigilance and capability for this threat,
3. The 3 keys to the recent success have been A)Israeli ingenuity, B) American resolve and C) Increased US domestic energy production which has given us increased flexibility in dealing with the region and made us not only wealthier but also safer.
4. Perhaps the biggest impact of the ‚Äú12 Day War‚Äù (if that‚Äôs what we are calling it?) may be its potential impact to reduce the chance of war on Taiwan/Korea & China/N. Korea if the correct lessons are learned.
