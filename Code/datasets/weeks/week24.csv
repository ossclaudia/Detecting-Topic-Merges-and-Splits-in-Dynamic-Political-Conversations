There were moments‚Äîfew and far between‚Äîthat I could find a glimmer of common ground: supporting our servicemembers and first responders, leading the world in innovation and resurrecting shipbuilding in the United States, and ending childhood cancer. 
 
But we can‚Äôt end childhood cancer while slashing cancer research funding at the NIH and gutting Medicaid‚Äîthe number one health insurer of children in this nation. We can‚Äôt lead the world in innovation or build more ships while instituting unreasonable tariffs on aluminum and lumber from our trading partners, threatening universities, and turning our back on our democratic allies. We can‚Äôt support our servicemembers and first responders by demonizing individuals who want to serve in our military, slashing federal funding for public safety programs, and summarily firing civil servants. 
 
During the longest address by an Executive to the Congress in history, the President spent less than two minutes on the high cost of living that so many Americans are burdened by every day. He did not commit to protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. In fact, he spent 13 minutes in ludicrous rants about fantastical (and wildly false) waste in Social Security and elsewhere in the federal government. 
 
I want to be clear that nothing about this Presidency‚Äìincluding his attacks on the civil service and the Constitution‚Äìis normal. I attended the Joint Address because I feel it is an important symbol of Congress as a co-equal branch of government, especially when the Executive is trying to test the limits of its powers. One-third of the American people voted for President Trump, one-third voted for someone else, and one-third did not feel passionately enough, heard, or represented to even vote. I‚Äôll be focused on listening and winning the hearts and minds of folks and colleagues in all three groups. That‚Äôs the path forward for us as a nation. That's the only way to earn the trust of colleagues across the aisle who can help us stop a lot of this calamity and nonsense.

Pushing the Ukrainians toward peace and trying to secure a critical minerals agreement with them makes perfect sense to me. Talking to Russia about how to end the conflict makes perfect sense to me. 

Ukraine has made major announcements in the last 48 hours about ceasefires, the minerals deal, and their willingness to engage in peace talks.

Putin has been defiant and resistant publicly to President Trump‚Äôs overtures. If Putin refuses to seriously come to the peace table, I hope and expect that President Trump would unleash more economic sanctions on Russia‚Äôs banking and energy sectors, and if necessary, apply massive tariffs. The impact on Russia‚Äôs already weak economy will force them to the table.

The Alamo is more than a battlefield. More than a legend. It‚Äôs a dare. A dare to stand when you‚Äôre outnumbered. A dare to fight when surrender is easier. A dare to believe that principles‚Äîreal, hard, inconvenient principles‚Äîare worth more than comfort, safety, or even survival.

In 1836, 189 men took that dare. They weren‚Äôt all Texans, and they weren‚Äôt all soldiers. But they had one thing in common‚Äîthey refused to live under tyranny. They didn‚Äôt expect to win. They expected to die. And they did.

But here‚Äôs the thing: The Alamo wasn‚Äôt a defeat. It was a spark. A spark that burned into the soul of every Texan, igniting a fight that led to victory at San Jacinto. In just 18 minutes, Texas was free, and the world learned something about Americans‚Äîwe don‚Äôt run.

 The spirit of the Alamo is still alive today. It lives in every American who stands for what‚Äôs right, who refuses to back down, and who chooses principle over convenience.

In the first weeks of this administration, Donald Trump fired 2,400 VA employees.

Each of these veterans has honorably and courageously fulfilled their obligation to our country and in many, many cases they bear the scars, visible and invisible, as a result of that service.
¬†
Today we have a backlog of 250,000 cases at the VA, which means months of waiting for those Veterans who are waiting for treatment or benefits or both.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1898059222023278849',"Each week, we shine a light on the extraordinary individuals who strengthen and uplift our community. But every so often, a story emerges that speaks to something even greater‚Äîthe quiet power of instinct, the courage found in the unexpected, and the steadfast presence of those who rise to meet the moment when it matters most.

As we approach International Women‚Äôs Day, we celebrate the women who keep our communities, our families, and our world moving forward‚Äînot with fanfare but with unwavering resolve. And this week, we recognize one such woman‚Äîa nurse whose quick thinking and steady hands turned what could have been a crisis into a moment of grace. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero‚ÄîStephanie Frisco, a school nurse in the @Neshaminy_SD.
 
Last Thursday began like any other at Walter S. Miller Elementary School in Levittown‚Äîhallways filled with eager students, teachers shaping young minds, and the steady rhythm of a school day unfolding. But for Genevieve Peto, a devoted educator and expectant mother, the day would take a turn for which no lesson plan could have prepared her.
 
In moments like these, there is no time for hesitation‚Äîno second chances, no margin for error. With the steady confidence that defines true heroes, Stephanie assessed the situation, understood the urgency, and took command. There was no hospital. No team of doctors. Just the four walls of a school nurse‚Äôs office and a woman who refused to let uncertainty stand in her way. And in just ten minutes, despite never having delivered a child before, Stephanie helped Genevieve bring baby Cora safely into the world. A moment that could have ended in crisis became a story of courage, instinct, and grace under pressure.
 
Genevieve understands how easily that day could have taken a different turn. But when she looks back, it‚Äôs not with fear‚Äîit‚Äôs with profound gratitude. ""She really was an angel, truly. We're beyond thankful.""
 
What happened that day was more than a remarkable moment‚Äîit was a testament to the women who, day after day, step up, lean in, and do what needs to be done. We see it in the halls of our schools, where teachers like Genevieve shape the next generation with patience and wisdom.We see it in the hands of nurses like Stephanie, whose instincts and composure turn the unexpected into the extraordinary. We see it in mothers, daughters, sisters, and leaders‚Äîin the women who make the world work, often without fanfare, always with resilience.
 
Tomorrow, we celebrate International Women‚Äôs Day‚Äîbut every day, we honor the Stephanie Friscos and Genevieve Petos of the world‚Äîthe women whose strength, skill, and resolve keep our families, our communities, and our country moving forward. So today, let's applaud Stephanie for her quick thinking and steady hands, congratulate Genevieve, welcome baby Cora into a world made stronger by women like them, and celebrate the countless women in PA-1 and beyond who show us, time and again, what true resilience looks like.",en,Tweet,1,10,1,4,1666.0,2025-03-07 17:12:37,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GldCzSQXUAAKa2W.jpg

This investment has helped strengthen school security measures, ensuring a safer learning environment for students and staff.

These funds have been used to enhance district-wide security, including bullet-resistant film for interior windows, upgraded security cameras, non-scalable fencing, advanced monitoring systems with badge access, and salaries for tech personnel to oversee and install security infrastructure. By implementing these improvements, Lytle ISD is better equipped to respond to potential threats and maintain a secure environment for students.

Today, I once again called on PHMSA Acting Administrator Ben Kochman to address these concerns with urgency and provide full documentation. The integrity of this pipeline, the safety of our families, and the protection of our natural resources are non-negotiable.

Among the critical questions raised:

‚úîÔ∏è What led triggered Sunoco to install Type A sleeves in the 1990s on the Twin Oaks pipeline?

‚úîÔ∏è Can PHMSA provide evidence that Sunoco has comprehensive and effective emergency response plans to adequately protect densely populated residential areas and critical natural resources in the event of a major pipeline failure?

‚úîÔ∏è What enhanced preventative measures have been implemented in high-risk residential areas?

‚úîÔ∏è What threshold must be met for PHMSA to mandate a pipeline shutdown, and how close is Sunoco‚Äôs pipeline to that threshold?

Upper Makefield residents deserve clear answers, real oversight, and stronger enforcement to protect their homes and environment. PHMSA must act now. I will always fight to protect our home, and continue pushing until we get the transparency and accountability our community deserves.

"Perez, Marie Gluesenkamp",Representative,Washington,3,Democratic,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMGP,'1899585631933673685',"Today, I voted against a flawed Continuing Resolution, because we should work on a bipartisan basis to pass a bill that works for communities like mine.

My highest priority in Congress is to defend the interests of #WA03 ‚Äì and the path of chaos and uncertainty today‚Äôs partisan CR presents is at best counterproductive and at worst empowers the most partisan members of Congress to have the most say in how our public dollars are spent.

This CR fails to fund much-needed community-led investments across SW WA to support public safety, veterans, students, farmers, and utility infrastructure.

It lowers funding levels for the U.S. Geological Survey and NOAA, as our communities face concerns about seismic monitoring in the region and layoffs of employees that provide vital weather data for maritime safety.

It would also cut U.S. Army Corps of Engineers construction funding by 44% ‚Äì which could impact efforts to keep goods moving safely on our waterways and manage flood risk ‚Äì while halting new projects.

This legislation cuts nearly $800M from VA facility construction, doesn't protect funding levels for veterans homelessness, mental health, and addiction programs, and provides no advance appropriations for the Toxic Exposures Fund to avoid lapses in support for heroes suffering from service-connected illnesses.

It also decreases funding for state, private, and Tribal forestry programs that support forest management and prevent wildfire, small business development projects, clean drinking water grants, state and local law enforcement programs, and the Community Connect Program, which has supported rural broadband expansion in Lewis County.

A $20.2 billion cut to IRS operations and tax enforcement would also make it more difficult to investigate complex forms of tax evasion by the wealthiest Americans ‚Äì which delivers a significant return on investment.

The DoD has also never operated for an entire fiscal year under a CR, which raises concerns about impacts on our military readiness.

Congress too frequently relies on stopgap measures, rather than completing full-year bipartisan funding solutions. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I know how important it is to protect Congress‚Äôs power of the purse ‚Äì and provide guidance to agencies on how to effectively spend taxpayer dollars.

Congress needs to do the hard work of passing regular appropriations bills, rather than ceding our Constitutional obligations by relying on a hastily constructed CR.

I came to Congress to vote on the merits of bills. As an independent voice for SW WA, I‚Äôll continue to put hardworking families first out of fierce loyalty to our communities.

Folks across #WA03 want responsible governance ‚Äì and I look forward to finding bipartisan opportunities to address our most urgent priorities.

I urge all of my colleagues on both sides to get back to the table and negotiate a responsible, bipartisan fiscal package that meets the needs of communities like ours.",en,Tweet,3,220,24,34,12299.0,2025-03-11 22:18:01,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",#WA03,,,

"Roy, Chip",Representative,Texas,21,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepChipRoy,'1899606251253952709',"üö® REP. ROY STATEMENT ON HOUSE PASSAGE OF CONTINUING RESOLUTION üö®

""Today, I voted to effectively freeze spending levels for six more months and to give runway for the Trump Administration to continue its efforts to root out wasteful spending. House Republicans and President Trump are moving quickly to clean up the mess left by Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden, who refused to pass a budget or any appropriations bills ‚Äì despite the House GOP passing five off the floor, and all 12 out of committee.

Notably, this ‚Äúcontinuing resolution‚Äù excludes earmarks, modestly reduces year-over-year spending, and most importantly, prevents Democrats from purposefully shutting down DOGE, President Trump, and Russ Vought from uncovering the billions in waste, fraud, and abuse that has been going on for decades.  The American people are now seeing that this whole town ‚Äì THE SWAMP ‚Äì has been wasting their money on absurd expenditures.

But this is just one more step, of many, in the spending fight.  

Now, our focus must be on supporting the President‚Äôs efforts to impound and rescind unnecessary spending, passing appropriations bills for FY26 at a low topline including many of the DOGE-identified cuts, and then finalizing a conservative reconciliation package. We must cut the massive inflation tax resulting from rampant spending by working to deliver on spending reductions ABOVE the $2 trillion FLOOR the House passed in our budget along with making tax cuts permanent.
