That’s the real world. But here in the U.S. Senate, we are currently debating a rescissions package that would severely cut funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, drastically affecting Alaska’s 27 public media stations and many more across the nation. 

Some colleagues claim they are targeting “radical leftist organizations” with these cuts, but in Alaska, these are simply organizations dedicated to their communities. Their response to today’s earthquake is a perfect example of the incredible public service these stations provide.

He would have a lot to say about what’s going on these days. The attacks on our democracy. The whitewashing of our history. The efforts to make it harder for Americans to vote.

Old battles have indeed become new again, but if there is one thing that John taught us, it’s that we must press on!

When I am at my most distraught, I think about John's words as he crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the last time before his passing. His body was frail and riddled with cancer but his mind was sharp and his charge to us was clear.

“Never give up. Never give in. Keep the faith, and keep your eyes on the prize.”

My friends, we are living through troubling times. We can be tired. We can be frustrated. We can be downright mad. But what we cannot do is give up.

Just imagine where we would be if John Lewis and those Foot Soldiers had given up on Bloody Sunday. They were beaten, bruised, gassed, and whipped. They had every reason to throw up their hands and surrender!

But they didn't. They got back up and tried again. They marched on until victory was won.

Now more than ever, we need to take a page from their playbook.

As we navigate this dark chapter of our history, let’s keep the faith, and let’s continue to get into some Good Trouble.

"Salazar, Maria Elvira",Representative,Florida,27,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMariaSalazar,'1945908933735895546',"This is incorrect.

This is a provision from the Dream Act included in the bill. No criminals or gang members are eligible. Period. 

Here’s how it works — when a Dreamer would apply to adjust status, there is an investigation - including a criminal background check, check for gang affiliation, and more. 

During that investigation, the federal and state gang database network can absolutely be a factor in determining gang membership, but the presence on a list alone does not disqualify them immediately.

There must be another factor to prove gang membership - which could be a criminal charge (not just conviction), tattoos, gang dress, evidence from law enforcement investigations, social media, witness testimony, prison records, etc. 

Also, the burden is on the Dreamer to prove they qualify for adjusted status - so if they are on a database (or not on a database, but there is other proof of gang membership), they have to prove that is incorrect. 

This is because the gang databases have proven inaccurate in federal courts. 

Just like many who have found themselves incorrectly flagged on a database - NICS (gun purchases), No Fly list, etc - when they shouldn’t be. 

So when it comes to gang membership, it means — Gang database + another factor.

"Durbin, Richard J.",Senator,Illinois,,Democratic,"Senate: 1997-Present, House: 1983-1997",Yes,SenatorDurbin,'1945927342179647534',"Today’s Committee executive business meeting included 10 nominees—among them Emil Bove, nominated for a lifetime appointment on the federal bench.

Mr. Bove belongs nowhere near the federal bench.

He led the Administration’s effort to strike a corrupt bargain with New York City Mayor Eric Adams and has been trailed by a history of complaints—long predating his affiliation with President Trump—about his temperament, poor judgment, and lack of candor before the court.

Additionally, Erez Reuveni, a career Justice Department attorney who defended the first Trump Administration’s immigration policies, filed a whistleblower complaint with my office regarding Mr. Bove.

That complaint recounted that Mr. Bove suggested DOJ might need to say ""f--- you"" to federal courts that issued orders that the Administration opposed.

I asked Mr. Reuveni whether he could substantiate his claims, and in response, he provided text messages, email exchanges, and other documents corroborating his allegations.

Given Mr. Reuveni’s credible allegations against Mr. Bove, which, if true, clearly disqualify him for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench, I called for the Committee to hear from Mr. Reuveni, under oath, before we voted on Mr. Bove’s nomination.

But Chairman Grassley denied that request.

And today, he cut off debate time on Mr. Bove’s nomination before turning to his vote, as well as nine other nominations, including Ms. Pirro’s.

Chairman Grassley claimed that he was following Committee precedent. This is simply untrue.

When I was Chair, I only limited debate when Republicans invoked Senate rules to shut down Committee meetings, and after Committee members were given ample opportunities to voice their concerns about nominees on the agenda.

Today, Chairman Grassley blocked Democratic members from discussing the controversial records of nominees like Emil Bove and Jeanine Pirro, shut down debate, and forced votes for no apparent reason.

I voted YES on the GENIUS Act because it’s a meaningful step toward ensuring that Americans who choose to invest in stablecoins are protected from fraud and abuse. This bill is far from perfect and more must be done to confront the blatant corruption we’re seeing from Donald Trump, who has shamelessly used his position as President to line his pockets with millions in crypto. I’ll keep fighting for strong anti-corruption legislation to stop the kind of self-dealing that’s happening in plain sight.
 
I voted NO on the CLARITY Act. I support a regulatory framework that distinguishes between digital assets, fosters innovation, and promotes responsible growth, but this bill simply doesn’t get us there. It’s riddled with loopholes and carveouts that leave everyday investors exposed to the kinds of volatile, often fraudulent crypto schemes we’ve seen too regularly with memecoins. It fails to strike the right balance between innovation and consumer protection. As the bill moves to the Senate, it’s critical that our colleagues strengthen it, starting with ensuring that states like Massachusetts retain the authority to crack down on fraud and abuse.

Given the Army presence at the Corpus Christi and Red River Army Depots, Army Futures Command, Forts Hood and Bliss, Joint Base San Antonio and other critical military installations, it’s clear that Texas offers unmatched advantages in infrastructure, workforce, and geographic positioning. Texas is the most capable and ready state to accelerate Army transformation.

The conversation reinforced that Texas has long served as the backbone of American defense—home to hundreds of thousands of servicemembers, military families, and a robust defense industrial base. With world-class installations and proven readiness, Texas is uniquely positioned to lead the next era of the U.S. Army.

I affirmed that Texas should not just be a participant, but a core partner in what ATI represents: forward-leaning innovation, operational agility, and strategic readiness. The discussion highlighted the critical importance of protecting and expanding the missions at Red River Army Depot (RRAD), Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA), and Army Futures Command (AFC)—each of which plays an indispensable role in supporting the Army’s current and future force.

The meeting also included proposals to relocate additional Army missions and capabilities to Texas. These actions would strengthen ATI implementation while maximizing efficiency, speed, and national security outcomes.

Cartels are using drones to track Border Patrol and troop movements, enabling the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into the U.S. These systems are growing more advanced and harder to detect, putting border communities and law enforcement at serious risk. Unlike responsible operators, cartels don’t follow regulations — they adapt quickly to evade detection. This amendment helps our agents match that agility by giving them the tools and authority to respond in real time.

Working with @RepCloudTX, we developed bipartisan language that directs @FAANews, @DHSgov, and @CBP to create a no-drone zone along the southern border. It targets illegal activity without disrupting responsible drone use. The amendment also includes clear exceptions for law enforcement, emergency responders, and legal operators like farmers and ranchers.

This sends a clear message: Congress recognizes the threat and expects federal agencies to act swiftly to counter it.

""Today, House Republicans took a significant step forward to provide a market framework to ensure that Americans can innovate with cryptocurrencies. 

I supported H.R. 3633, the CLARITY Act, to allow such innovation without fear of an uncertain regulatory environment.
 
I was most proud to support H.R. 1919, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act – which will guarantee that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC’s) are not permitted in the United States. CBDC’s would represent a radical attack on the privacy of Americans and would allow government and financial institutional unchecked power over our bank accounts, and importantly, our freedom to purchase and move about unimpeded by government surveillance. No government power should be able to limit the ability of a citizen to transact pre-emotive lay based on the policy whims of any particular party in power. The Senate should pass this and send it to the President’s desk immediately.
 
Regrettably, I opposed S. 1582, the GENIUS Act because it was passed without the necessary protections to prevent Central Bank Digital Currencies, and I do not believe we should proceed with building out the necessary structures for stable coin or the development of market structures (CLARITY) without the protection against CBDC.
 
Innovation and prosperity is important – but freedom is the centerpiece of both. We should demand freedom first.""",en,Tweet,0,24,3,6,3183.0,2025-07-18 03:07:48,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

We saw the consequences of weakened alert systems during the catastrophic floods in Texas. Communities were caught flat-footed, in part because they lacked access to timely, reliable emergency broadcasts. Contrast that with what we saw just yesterday in Alaska, where public broadcasters immediately issued alerts after a powerful 7.3 magnitude offshore earthquake, potentially saving lives.

The American people hardly have any idea what it is, what it means, and what passed.

1. GENUIS ACT - I voted NO. It passed the Senate and the House and will be signed into law today. 
This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor Centralized Bank Digital Currency. The Federal Reserve has been planning a CBDC for years and this will open the door to move you to a cashless society and into digital currency that can be weaponized against you by an authoritarian government controlling your ability to buy and sell. Do you actually trust your government to never do that to you? I don’t.

2. Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act - I voted YES. This bill passed the House but we were told all week that it will not pass the Senate because the Senate does not have any path at all to get 60 votes to ban a CBDC. This bill prohibits Federal Reserve Banks from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency. It’s a good bill and protects your money, but will die in the Senate. However, this should be people’s highest demand.

3. Clarity Act - I voted YES for self custody protections. This bill passed the House and will likely get some changes in the Senate then have come back to the House for another vote before it can be signed by the President and become law. This bill establishes a detailed regulatory framework for digital assets and allocates authority between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The most important thing that needs to remain is protecting people’s self custody of their digital currency. This is yet to be seen and should be demanded. I will vote NO when it comes back if self custody protections are taken out.

In 1971, we were taken off the gold standard to cash, which was a ridiculous decision and has weakened our dollar tremendously.

Now we are on the path to move from cash you can hold in your hand, hide from the government, and save for yourself and your family to a digital currency system where your ability to buy and sell will ultimately be held in digital accounts that you can not tangibly hold yet are at the will of those who control the banks and the government.",en,Tweet,805,6082,2027,817,273095.0,2025-07-18 14:10:04,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

The third witness in our investigation into the cover-up of President Biden’s cognitive decline and unauthorized executive actions pleaded the Fifth Amendment today. There is now a pattern of key Biden confidants seeking to shield themselves from criminal liability for this potential conspiracy.

Annie Tomasini, former Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Oval Office Operations, pleaded the Fifth when asked if Joe Biden, a member of his family, or anyone at the White House instructed her to lie regarding his health at any time. She also pleaded the Fifth when asked if she ever advised President Biden on the handling of classified documents found in his garage, if President Biden or anyone in the White House instructed her to conceal or destroy classified material found at President Biden’s home or office, and if she ever conspired with anyone in the White House to hide information regarding the Biden family’s ‘business’ dealings.
 
It’s unbelievable that Ms. Tomasini and others refuse to answer basic questions about President Biden’s fitness to serve.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1946281104756945129',"Each week, we recognize a Hometown Hero—someone whose impact on our community is lasting, profound, and deeply felt.
 
This week, we honor someone who has long embodied that title: Carla Reynolds. While she was named a Hometown Hero before, it only felt right—especially this week—to honor her once more.
 
This past weekend, we gathered for Unity Day, the event Carla built with love, vision, and purpose. It was moving, powerful, and unmistakably her. Though her physical presence was missing, her spirit filled every corner of that celebration.
 
Carla believed in the power of unity, not as a slogan, but as a way of life. Through Unity Day and her Boots on the Ground Foundation, she brought people together across every divide, fed families in crisis, and gave hope to those who felt unseen or unheard. She believed in meeting people where they are—and lifting them up with dignity and grace.
 
She also poured her heart into our young people, spotlighting Bucks County students who excelled in school, in service, and in sports—because, in her words, “Our kids need to know we see them.”
 
Carla made our community feel more whole, more connected, more compassionate, more human. Her life was a living example of what it means to love your neighbor. And though we said goodbye far too soon, we will continue to celebrate her, carry forward her mission, and ensure that Unity Day remains a tradition that reflects her values and vision.
 
To her daughter Tamara and all who loved her: thank you for sharing Carla with us—she will forever be our Hometown Hero.",en,Tweet,0,8,1,4,1369.0,2025-07-18 19:49:10,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GwKUVq2W4AAUk8g.jpg

Mass amnesty is NOT the answer to solving America’s illegal immigration crisis.

Our Constitution is clear; if you want to become an American citizen, FOLLOW THE LAW.

"Cuellar, Henry",Representative,Texas,28,Democratic,House: 2005-Present,Yes,RepCuellar,'1946397111471485207',"Today, I held a press conference alongside Mayor Treviño to update the community on how the Department of Defense is supporting border security here in Laredo.
 
Last week, I toured one of the Stryker units with Mayor Treviño, Customs and Border Protection, and Army leadership to see firsthand how these armored vehicles equipped with thermal imaging and drone detection technology are helping strengthen our border security. These assets provide critical surveillance in the dense brush where illegal crossings often happen, giving Border Patrol real-time intelligence and allowing agents to respond more effectively and safely.
 
I also spoke with Major General Scott Naumann, Commander of Joint Task Force–Southwest Border, to hear directly what our troops need to succeed. The challenges we face are real and growing. Earlier this week, I was briefed on an alarming incident where an Army official was assaulted by an undocumented individual hiding in thick brush. Thankfully no one was injured, but these kinds of threats are increasing. Laredo now ranks among the top cities for cartel-operated drone activity, and the Rio Grande brush accounts for the vast majority of illegal crossings and concealment.
 
The Stryker units are already making an impact. Their cameras can detect movement as small as a mouse from over a mile away, helping Border Patrol focus resources where they are needed and deterring illegal crossings. Clearing overgrown vegetation is also critical to improving visibility and patrol mobility. The Stryker units are prepared to assist with clearing key zones in coordination with the International Boundary and Water Commission and local groups to ensure it’s done responsibly and transparently.
 
These vehicles remain on perimeter routes and use sensors, not weapons, to scan from a distance. They are not patrolling our streets or enforcing immigration law. This is a precision mission focused on deterring cartel drones, disrupting smuggling networks, and ensuring the safety of our frontline officers.
 
In Congress, I am working to fund river-road improvements, expand patrol access routes, remove Carrizo cane, and modernize federal law so Border Patrol and military units have the tools and protections they need.
 
I want to thank Mayor Treviño, Chief Muñoz, @DHSgov , @DeptofDefense , and our local law enforcement for working in lockstep to reducing cartel-drone incursions, illegal crossings, stash houses, and high-speed car chases. This unified effort across all levels of government is delivering results.
 
South Texas is strong and resilient. When we work together and lead with facts, not fear, we rise to any challenge. To every soldier, agent, and neighbor, thank you.

That’s why affordable housing is my number one issue as the proud U.S. Representative for our home.  It’s why I introduced a legislative package as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee to help tackle this crisis from every angle: expanding tax credits to build more workforce housing, helping first-time homebuyers afford a down payment, freeing up existing housing stock, and co-leading the Rent Relief Act to put money back in renters' pockets when housing costs soar.

CA-19 was named the least affordable rental market in the U.S. To afford a modest two-bedroom, you’d need to earn $81.21/hour. That’s five full-time jobs at minimum wage. 

As your Federal Representative, I continue to fight the challenges that we face when it comes to affordability. I don’t just talk about it, I’m actually doing something about it to ensure that the federal government plays its part to ensure that living in CA-19 is more affordable.

I’m proud to announce I’ve secured $25 million to revitalize the Bristol Port Terminal—one of the largest infrastructure investments in our county’s history.

This transformative project will:

✅ Build a new 1,100-foot dock
✅ Modernize offloading operations
✅ Dredge over 70,000 cubic yards of material
✅ Upgrade rail lines to expand freight capacity

This isn’t just about infrastructure—it’s about the future of our regional economy. It will reshape supply chain access, create good-paying jobs, and position Bucks County as a critical hub in America’s infrastructure network.

This is a great step forward, and I look forward to continuing working closely with the Bucks County Redevelopment Authority and local leaders, especially in Edgely, on additional infrastructure projects already underway to address local traffic and strengthen commerce.

A few days later, President Trump thankfully issued an executive order to address abuse specific to wind and solar projects. 

This administration is moving the ball forward in alignment with most Americans who are tired of watching their tax dollars subsidize projects that should stand on their own.

These federal programs—Head Start, childcare services, food pantries—were created to help low-income American families, not to be handed out to illegal aliens. If we are going to get a handle on our spending and end the magnet for illegal immigration, we must end benefits for non-citizens.

The Trump administration is right to require that federal benefits only go to those who are legally eligible. That’s not controversial. It’s common sense.

California’s push to block this change is solely about continuing to give benefits to those not in our country legally. It’s about clinging to a failed, lawless immigration agenda and forcing taxpayers to foot the bill. I support President Trump’s effort to restore order to our benefits system and ensure that these programs serve the people they were meant to—U.S. Citizens.

Today, I am proud to join as a cosponsor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act — a vital step toward truth and accountability in the face of unspeakable abuse. With this resolution, we declare unequivocally that violence against women will not be ignored.  

For years, Epstein’s victims — many of them just children when they were abused — have waited for justice, often in silence and in pain. 

They deserve answers. They deserve dignity. And they deserve action from their government. 

That is why it is especially shameful that Speaker Johnson has shut down the House of Representatives for the summer to avoid a vote on this resolution. 

To block transparency in this manner is not only an abdication of duty — it is a profound insult to the victims who have carried the burden of this trauma for decades.  

The American people deserve to know the full extent of who was involved with Epstein and all of them must be held accountable — no matter how powerful.

In Pennsylvania, MA beneficiaries save over $3,000 a year on average and experience 70% fewer hospital readmissions compared to traditional Medicare.

I have been, and will continue to be, firm in my efforts to protect and improve essential programs like Medicare Advantage because they deliver real results for our seniors.

Today, I asked Alignment Health CEO Dawn Maroney how integrated care is improving patient outcomes, and Dr. Brian Miller how we can reduce administrative burdens like prior authorization that delay care and drain provider resources.

The evidence is undeniable: Medicare Advantage is essential, it works, and it can and must be strengthened—not sidelined.
