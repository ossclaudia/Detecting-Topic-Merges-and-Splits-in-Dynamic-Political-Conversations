Unfortunately, today it has come to my attention that one of the 2025 recipients of the Harry S.

This scholarship must be rescinded and I am calling for a full review of the political imbalance in the scholarship selections.

I urge the Trump administration to collaborate with the Israeli government and humanitarian organizations working in Gaza to establish a safer and more effective approach to delivering aid, while doing everything possible to ensure Hamas does not steal these resources from civilians. Failing to adequately address the humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza is a failure to uphold U.S. values, increases Hamas‚Äôs support, and prolongs the war.

Today, we honor the life and service of Alec Campbell‚Äîa DCNR Resource Ranger at Tyler State Park, a devoted father, and a true public servant‚Äîwhose life was tragically cut short this past weekend at just 38 years old.
 
Alec‚Äôs passing is a heartbreaking loss‚Äînot only to those who knew and loved him but to our entire community. Rangers like Alec rarely seek spotlight but their service is essential. They are the quiet guardians of our natural spaces‚Äîeducators, protectors, first responders, and stewards‚Äîoften putting themselves in harm‚Äôs way to ensure the safety and well-being of others.
 
Alec embodied that spirit of service in every sense. Along with restoring trails, removing invasive species, and planting natives, perhaps his most important work was leading volunteer and youth projects that have left a lasting mark on Tyler State Park. He was a patient teacher, a passionate conservationist, and a calming presence for visitors from all walks of life. Whether working with young Scouts or guiding students through the forest, Alec always made people feel seen, heard, and safe.
 
His background in psychology, his gift for connection, and his deep love for the outdoors made him more than a ranger‚Äîhe was a bridge between people and nature, between learning and healing.
 
It‚Äôs easy to take that kind of service for granted. But we shouldn‚Äôt. Because our parks don‚Äôt care for themselves. Our trails don‚Äôt repair themselves. And when someone gets lost or needs help, it‚Äôs rangers like Alec who answer the call.
 
Please join me in extending our prayers and condolences to Alec‚Äôs wife, Rena, their two young boys, Calder and Miles, and his @DCNRnews family. Let us honor Alec by remembering the value of quiet service‚Äîand by recognizing the brave men and women like him who dedicate their lives to preserving, protecting, and serving our community every single day.

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump Administration delivered this week:

President Trump has once again proven that his loyalties are to the rich and well connected. This week, he pardoned over a dozen former elected officials, reality TV personalities, mega donors and a gang leader. Some of the cleared charges include corruption, tax evasion, insider trading, bribery, and federal firearm offenses.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues to undermine the health care and medical research across this country, unilaterally deciding this week that healthy children and healthy pregnant people should not get the covid vaccine. He also announced that medical journals are corrupt and scientists should no longer publish their research in them. Secretary Kennedy also continues to spread misinformation in service of President Trump‚Äôs agenda by misrepresenting scientific data and citing medical studies that do not exist.

President Trump and his allies are to trying to manipulate the information being shared with the American people. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard asked analysts at her agency to revise a report that was at odds with President Trump‚Äôs immigration policy, and the White House fired members a nonpartisan organization that publishes a record of U.S. foreign policy.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is in hot water again after it was reported that he used illegal and unconstitutional wiretaps as part of his investigation into information leaks coming from the Pentagon.

The Trump Administration will no longer allow federal employees to use paid time off in order to vote.

This is a crisis that has taken far too many lives, but one that this community is confronting with courage and unity.

Together, we recognized the deep toll this epidemic has taken on our families, our neighborhoods, and our way of life. Many lives in Webb County have been lost to fentanyl. Each one was a loved and valued member of our community. But in the face of that pain, Laredo did not stay silent or still. You came together, took action, and chose to fight back.

Thanks to the extraordinary leadership of individuals like Mayor Dr. Victor D. Trevi√±o, Deputy Fire Chief Roberto Gonzalez, Police Chief Miguel A. Rodriguez Jr., and Sheriff Martin Cuellar, along with our educators, health professionals, law enforcement, and countless community partners, overdose deaths in Webb County dropped by 52 percent in just one year. That is real progress and a testament to what is possible when a community works together.

Nearly five million dollars in federal support has helped fund prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts, including expanded Narcan access. But the driving force behind this change is right here in Laredo. It is in the people who refused to lose another life without a fight.

As part of today‚Äôs conference, I was proud to present Congressional Certificates of Recognition to several law enforcement agencies and community organizations for their outstanding efforts in combating substance abuse and saving lives. Their dedication has made a lasting impact and continues to protect and uplift our community.

All in manipulations to support wars and issues that have absolutely nothing to do with our people, our security, and our future.

Yet the taxpayer funding that has been doled out by the trillions always enriches the military industrial complex and special interest NGOs and all the people that figure out how to get contracts off the latest grift.

$36 trillion dollars in debt.

Our fathers, uncles, brothers, sons, cousins, and friends killed or forever injured from foreign wars.

A federal government and elected leaders obsessed with foreign causes and conflicts going on taxpayer funded codels to inject themselves into the grift.

A never ending flow of lobbyists going through revolving doors of Congressmen‚Äôs offices with funding requests that ‚Äúprotect jobs‚Äù in our districts.

And mainly a government that is too broke to fix our own infrastructure, education system, mental health and drug crisis, and invest in our children‚Äôs futures. 

American people, you aren‚Äôt angry enough at what your leaders have done to you and lied to you about for decades now. 

And you are the only ones who can truly fix it.",en,Tweet,586,16781,4484,2804,519719.0,2025-05-31 14:19:25,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

While the details of this ‚Äúdeal‚Äù remain murky, any agreement struck between President Trump and Nippon is unenforceable unless steelworkers are at the table. The current collective bargaining agreement requires robust investment to keep Granite City competitive worldwide. Given that the current proposal fails to meet those standards, it simply cannot move forward.

Granite City deserves more than broken promises and publicity stunts. I‚Äôm fighting to ensure that at least $500 million of the $14 billion deal is dedicated to upgrading Granite City Works with a modern granulation system and the infrastructure needed for workers to thrive. It's unfathomable that the initial proposal includes billions for new facilities yet leaves behind the steelworkers at Granite City Works ‚Äì men and women who have honorably served U.S. Steel since 1927.

"Fine, Randy",Representative,Florida,6,Republican,House: 2025-Present,Yes,RepFine,'1929517581506867352',"I couldn't sleep last night.  I can't sleep on my plane to DC.  Too much sadness, anger, and fear.  

I‚Äôm not supposed to be in Congress.  Seven months ago, I got elected to the Florida Senate.  I worked hard to get there.   I was excited thinking I'd have a four year break before another election.  

I couldn‚Äôt have imagined that two weeks later, I‚Äôd get called to run for Congress.  It wasn‚Äôt part of my plan.  It wasn't part of my family's.  

But G-d puts us where He wants us to be.   And as I sit on my flight to DC this morning, struggling to comprehend that I live in a country where Jews can be burned because they are Jews, I know at least one reason He put me here.  

80 years ago they burned us too.  Call your Jewish friends today.  They will tell you that it feels like we are being hunted.  That it is open season.  We are experiencing anti-Semitic hate unlike anything we have ever experienced. 

But there is hope. 

Florida is the safest place in America to be Jewish, and that is not by coincidence.   Together with my friends in the House and Senate -- and they are more than colleagues to me -- we passed bill after bill, most that I initially wrote by hand.  

It came at a cost.  Two people made death threats against my family that landed them in prison.  

It hasn't gone perfectly.  There are still issues.  And some could have done more.   But there has been massive progress. 

I am new in Congress, and as the guy who just showed up, I'm as low on the totem pole as you can be. 

But I am going to work with whoever is willing and whoever I have to in order to solve this problem.  And I will fight whoever opposes us, including anyone on my side who gets in my way.   

I did not come up with my nickname, but it does suit me. 

My power has always been my voice, and I won't be afraid to use it. 

Those who try to shout me down -- like the lunatics who comment here ‚Äî the leftists, the Nazis, the Muslim terrorists, the woke right, and those who I beat along the way ‚Äî every comment gives me more strength and more purpose. 

It refires the forge that was lit when I was a 13 year old boy facing my own trials of antisemitism. 

So keep it coming.   You just make me more determined.  You fuel the forge. 

My plane is getting ready to land in DC.  The battle is right in front of me. 

I am ready to fight.  I know we will win.  

Because we have a secret weapon:

We have G-d on our side.

There is no justification for this kind of targeted hate, and we need to be clear-eyed about the alarming rise of antisemitism in our own country. 

In 2024, there were more than 9,300 antisemitic incidents. That‚Äôs a 344% increase over the past five years and an 893% increase over the past decade. Our neighbors, friends, and fellow Americans are being targeted simply for being Jewish. We must speak out, stand up, and ensure that antisemitism is confronted wherever it manifests and that those who commit such acts are held fully accountable.

One MAJOR way: We're working with the Trump @WhiteHouse on an upcoming @DOGE cuts package to CANCEL wasteful spending using something called the rescissions process.

Here's how it works:

Under the Impoundment Control Act, we've asked the Trump administration to send Congress a package of previously appropriated federal funds for us to eliminate. 

Note: this rescissions package only requires a simple majority vote (aka 51 of our 53 @SenateGOP seats). 

Among other cuts, the upcoming rescissions package targets billions in wasteful foreign aid spending.

Now, once the Trump administration sends this rescissions package over, by law, Congress has 45 DAYS to review the funding and strike it down.

While celebrating his 21st birthday, Zach Carach was allegedly struck by a vehicle driven by Tony Lopez ‚Äî who then fled the scene.  Lopez is an illegal alien with six outstanding warrants. He was last seen in Mt. Juliet ‚Äî in my district. The license plate in the photo is reportedly linked to the vehicle that picked up Lopez after he abandoned a damaged rental car.

For context: Lopez entered the U.S. illegally in the fall of 2023 ‚Äî when Joe Biden was President.

Zach remains hospitalized, yet Nashville Mayor Freddie O‚ÄôConnell appears more focused on obstructing federal immigration enforcement than protecting the people of this city. Over the past two weeks, his administration has been accused of leaking DHS agent identities, directing questionable ‚Äúcharity‚Äù funds to illegal aliens, and publicly attacking law enforcement officials.

Why won‚Äôt he confront the surge of illegal aliens contributing to chaos in Middle Tennessee?

If Mayor O‚ÄôConnell won‚Äôt take action against fugitives in our communities, then it‚Äôs up to us ‚Äî law-abiding Americans ‚Äî to help. Share this post and demand justice for Zach. President Trump worked to secure our border. Now local leaders must do their part to help ICE remove those who never should have been here in the first place.

"Pressley, Ayanna",Representative,Massachusetts,7,Democratic,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepPressley,'1930005199244144657',"Yesterday, while ICE officials smugly touted the arrest of nearly 1,500 people in Massachusetts over the past month, I convened immigrant families from my district who have been unjustly harmed by Trump‚Äôs cruel and unlawful mass deportation agenda.

All across the Massachusetts 7th, ICE raids have robbed us of family members and our collective sense of security and belonging.

And the stories we heard were harrowing.

We heard from Kenia from Chelsea, who was driving to a Mother's Day church service with her husband Daniel when ICE agents in unmarked vehicles ambushed them, broke the passenger side window, forcefully extracted Daniel from the car, and slammed his face on the sidewalk while their three children watched in horror.

""We are devastated. No one should live through this,"" Kenia said. ""He needs to come home.""

We also heard from Mercedes, an East Boston resident, whose family is struggling after her husband Jose was arrested at work and detained for two days at an ICE facility in Burlington. Jose was living here legally with Temporary Protected Status but was told by the ICE agents who detained him that ""only people born here have rights.""

""We are deeply traumatized,"" she told us. ""My husband and I can't sleep. I'm afraid to go out. I'm afraid to take my daughter to school. Our 12-year-old daughter who was born in this country has anxiety attacks.""

And we heard from Yolanda, a Randolph resident, whose husband Santo was taken through the back exit of a police precinct and handed off to ICE officers, but not before he was mocked by the officers on duty and told to ""go meet his new family."" Santo was shipped off to a detention center in Louisiana, where he has struggled to control his diabetes and hypertension, and has reported that the medical staff and officers make fun of him because of his English and have failed to properly treat his conditions.

These horrific raids have never been about ""safety"" or ""law and order,"" as the Trump Administration claims ‚Äî they have always been about terrorizing immigrant families, abusing power, and sowing fear in our communities.

They are absolutely shameful and in many cases, unlawful and in violation of folks' constitutional rights.

Donald Trump is a dictator who wants a citizenry that is inactive and indifferent to the suffering of their neighbors, including our immigrant families in the Massachusetts 7th. But we will not stand by while he and ICE carry out their unlawful mass deportation agenda and rip our families apart.

We stand with our immigrant neighbors. Children should not live in fear of their parents disappearing. And elders should not live in fear of going to the grocery store or their faith house.

I was proud to convene this urgent and timely discussion about how we can push back against this harmful agenda, uplift impacted families, and share resources. And I am grateful to our advocates, families, and local partners for joining us.

Together, we say: Hands off our immigrant neighbors.",en,Tweet,0,86,22,195,6035.0,2025-06-03 21:54:31,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gsi1qBtXsAAh9DQ.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gsi1qBuXYAAs606.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gsi1qBtWAAAQSJx.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gsi1qB4XMAEbN48.jpg"
