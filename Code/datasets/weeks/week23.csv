Maybe it‚Äôs better - appreciate @LACaldwellDC for not wasting my time to write whatever she already planned anyway, and not harassing my family and my staff.

I was not planning to comment on the blatant lies from the fake media, but started to get inquiries from even more reputable outlets. I just cannot believe how low our level of journalism has became.

I am frustrated with my branch, which has not been governing for a while, and these unnecessary last-minute ‚Äúfloor drama‚Äù, but it‚Äôs my job to fix it.

I do not disclose details of my private conversations to the media, but I will take this opportunity to share my thoughts about President Trump that media never writes about.

President Trump is a strong man, but he is also a very kind and sensitive man who cares deeply about our country and the people. He listens - not like most politicians, and he truly wants to deliver regardless how hard it is. I do not recall him ever raising his voice with me. He knows that I care too. We always have very thoughtful and meaningful discussions. He is my only hope to get things done!

‚ÄúSpartz, sitting in the Republican cloakroom, took the call, and others could clearly hear the president‚Äôs voice screaming out of the speaker. She was a fake Republican derailing his agenda, he yelled. He was the president, he reminded her.‚Äù - Crazy blatant lie! What a sham! :)

-Aligning us with our adversaries and voting against our ally on the UN resolution condemning Russia for invading Ukraine
-Passing an initial budget framework in the House that would add $5 TRILLION to our national debt over just ten years and gut programs like Medicare and Medicaid so President Trump can extend tax cuts to the rich
-Firing ~6,000 American veterans who protected us as members of our all-volunteer armed forces and then served us again in federal jobs in the VA, Justice, Transportation, Social Security, Labor, and State departments, to name just a few
-Closing Social Security offices, laying off employees who manage its website and customer support, and closing its Offices of Transformation and Civil Rights, all to make it harder to apply for, manage, and receive the benefits that you have paid for in every paycheck
-Firing hundreds of scientists and experts from critical posts in the National Weather Service and NOAA just before the annual Atlantic storm season
-Preparing to cancel the FAA's contract with Verizon to award it to one of Elon Musk's companies, adding another $2B to the more than $3.3 BILLION Musk's SpaceX and Starlink have received from the federal government in just the past 12 months
-Announcing from the Oval Office the sale of $5 million ""Trump gold cards"" to provide rich people permanent U.S. residency and a pathway to citizenship
-Dismissing cases against companies accused of cheating millions of American consumers, including student loan and home mortgage companies that engaged in illegal kickbacks, loan churning, and illegal debt collections.

This week, we honor a young man who embodies the heart of a champion‚Äînot just in competition but in life. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero: Karl Dickersbach of Fairless Hills.
 
At 26 years old, Karl is more than an athlete‚Äîhe is a force of nature. Whether racing through the snow in a blistering 7-minute mile or soaring over the high jump in the summer heat, Karl has proven time and time again that no challenge is too great and no finish line too far. Since joining @SpecialOlympics in elementary school, he has shattered expectations, earning countless medals‚Äîmost of them gold‚Äîcompeting in events like the Rocky Run, the Marine Corps 10K, the Broad Street Run, and the legendary Penn Relays.
 
Through relentless training, unshakable determination, and a belief that there‚Äôs always another level to reach, Karl has proven that resilience is the key to greatness. His coaches struggle to keep up‚Äîeven on a bike‚Äîand his teammates look to him as a leader who elevates everyone around him.
 
Now, Karl is preparing for the biggest race of his life‚Äîrepresenting Pennsylvania at the 2026 Special Olympics USA Games in Minnesota. Among 3,000 elite athletes and 75,000 cheering fans, he will step onto the national stage, the product of years of grit, sacrifice, and determination. And if you ask his coaches‚ÄîTom Delaney and Lisa Rigefsky‚Äîthere‚Äôs no doubt: Karl is bringing home gold.
 
To Coach Delaney, a Bristol Township School District Special Education Life Skills teacher who has spent over 40 years empowering Special Olympics athletes in our community, Coach Rigefsky, and everyone who has supported Karl‚Äôs journey‚Äîwe thank you. Your leadership has helped fuel his success, and now, Karl is ready to make Bucks County proud.
 
Throughout his life, Karl has proven that with courage, heart, and determination, barriers can be broken, expectations surpassed, and limits redefined.
 
Karl, your entire community stands behind you, proud and inspired by your journey. As you prepare to take the national stage, know that we‚Äôll all be cheering for you, our Hometown Hero, every step of the way!",en,Tweet,0,18,0,13,7971.0,2025-02-28 17:06:42,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gk4-T0IWcAAtiFA.jpg

The CFPB overstepped its authority with its Biden-Era rule capping overdraft fees. While the rule claims to apply only to large banks, the real impact will hit community banks & consumers hardest.

‚ùå Higher costs for consumers ‚Äì With fewer revenue sources, community banks may be forced to raise account fees, increase minimum balance requirements, or limit low-cost banking options. This could push more Americans out of the banking system, not help them.

‚ùå Unfair market pressure on small banks ‚Äì Large banks may lower their overdraft fees to the CFPB‚Äôs arbitrary $5 benchmark, forcing smaller banks to follow suit or risk losing customers. Unlike big banks, community banks can‚Äôt absorb these losses, leading to reduced services and even bank closures. This rule would lead to consolidation and places community banks at a disadvantage.

‚ùå A blow to financial inclusion ‚Äì Millions of Americans rely on overdraft protection to cover emergency expenses. If banks eliminate or restrict overdraft services, many consumers will have fewer options and be forced toward riskier alternatives.

üö® This rule isn‚Äôt about protecting consumers‚Äîit‚Äôs about scoring cheap political points at the expense of Americans. In reality, it will make banking more expensive and less accessible for working families. If the Biden Administration did their homework and spoke to constituents, they'd know this rule is out of touch.

That‚Äôs why Republicans are pushing a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn this harmful regulation. We‚Äôre fighting to protect community banks, preserve consumer choice, and ensure Americans have access to the financial tools they need. Read the legislation below:

President Trump understands that there are very few options to find peace in this 1000 year old conflict and 3 year old war. American blood must not be shed in this fight, so all other options must be explored. President Trump and his team negotiated and came up with, what is quite possibly, the only way to stop the bloodshed and fighting at this point.

The warriors of the Ukrainian military have valiantly fought this war for 3 years. I‚Äôve met with them personally and they have shown courage and bravery in the face of evil.

After only a few weeks in office, President Trump ended America‚Äôs existential border crisis.

For my entire life, the American people have begged Washington to secure our border. And Presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Obama and Biden completely ignored them. They would campaign on securing the border, lie to the American people, and ultimately do nothing.

The lure of millions of new voters or hoards of cheap serf laborers was too appealing to pass up.

But not for Trump.

In February, Border Patrol recorded 8,326 unlawful illegal alien entries.

For reference, when Biden was in office, we‚Äôd have more alien crossings in a single day than that.

8,326 is the lowest number of monthly unlawful entries since Border Patrol began reporting monthly data in 2000.

And while Biden released thousands of unvetted aliens into our heartland every day, the aliens caught under President Trump were detained and deported.

President Trump didn‚Äôt make excuses. He didn‚Äôt focus on ‚Äúroot causes‚Äù or external factors out of our control. He simply chose to enforce America‚Äôs border policies already on the books: capture, detain, deport.

He did his job.

‚ÄúThroughout my time in Congress, I have been working side-by-side with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a solution to enable a long overdue nonstop flight between Washington Reagan Airport and San Antonio. ¬†

In April 2023, I led a letter with the San Antonio delegation to build support for this important flight. Additionally, in the Rules Committee on which I serve, we secured a vote on an amendment to add 7 more direct flights to DCA. Though this amendment fell just short in the House, it demonstrated enormous support and helped pave the way for the compromise of 5 additional slots at DCA that we saw in the Senate-passed FAA bill led by Senator Ted Cruz in May 2024.¬†Finally, in July 2024, Senator Ted Cruz and I led a letter to the Department of Transportation (DOT) urging the Biden Administration to award San Antonio with one of the nonstop flight spots.¬†

Today, the people of San Antonio saw the results of the San Antonio delegation's work toward achieving this priority.¬†I am proud to know that the men and women of Military City, U.S.A will finally be able to fly directly to the airport next door to the Pentagon and that all those in the region can visit their nation's capital more easily.

I‚Äôd like to thank Senator Ted Cruz for his steadfast leadership and work on this effort. ¬†I would also like to thank Senator Cornyn, Rep. Henry Cuellar, Rep. Joaquin Castro, Rep. Greg Casar, Rep. Tony Gonzales, and Mayor Nirenberg for banding together to deliver this priority.¬†

"Neal, Richard E.",Representative,Massachusetts,1,Democratic,House: 1989-Present,Yes,RepRichardNeal,'1897066527108780246',"Mike Slater's story can be summed up in one word: service.

After four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, he returned home to continue that service, first working as the Director of Veterans' Services for South Hadley, and most recently as Program Support Assistant with the Springfield Vet Center.

On February 13, Mike, along with more than 1,000 other VA employees, were let go in one of the many rounds of firings we've witnessed under this administration.

When our servicemembers enter the service, we make them a promise: you protect us, and we‚Äôll take care of you. The VA is central to the obligation we have of fulfilling that promise, which is why we saw historic investments under President Biden with the enactment of the PACT Act. Now, this administration is turning their backs on our veterans at a time when they need our help the most.

The suggestion that nobody from the VA who interacts with veterans has been let go is simply not true, and Mike is a testament to that fact. The notion that we are going to cut programs like Medicaid and SNAP and terminate jobs with the VA, IRS, FAA, and other federal agencies all to support a tax cut for the top two percent is absurd.
