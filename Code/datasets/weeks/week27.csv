"Massie, Thomas",Representative,Kentucky,4,Republican,House: 2012-Present,Yes,RepThomasMassie,'1905047117409800200',"Yesterday, our Judiciary Committee passed HR 38, National Reciprocity. I support this bill, but there is a better option, and it is National Constitutional Carry.

29 states already have Constitutional (i.e. permitless) Carry. Why not extend it to all 50 states?

Under HR 38 (Reciprocity), a resident of one of the Constitutional Carry states can carry in any state that allows their citizens to obtain a permit. The recent ‚ÄúBruen‚Äù Supreme Court decision requires all states that aren‚Äôt Constitutional Carry to issue carry permits to their citizens.

This means that when HR 38 passes, any resident of those 29 Constitutional Carry states will be able to carry in any of the 50 states without a permit. Ironically, however, residents of the 21 states (like New York or California) that aren‚Äôt Constitutional Carry will need a permit to carry in their own state, while visitors from states that are Constitutional Carry (like Kentucky or Ohio) won‚Äôt need a permit to carry in states like New York or California.

If Congress, relying on the Second Amendment, can force California to allow ‚ÄúPermitless‚Äù Carry for Kentuckians who visit California, why would we not force California to allow ‚ÄúPermitless‚Äù Carry for Californians who are in California? In other words, why not pass National Constitutional Carry and afford everyone in the United States the right to ‚Äúbear arms‚Äù which is enshrined in the Constitution?

The other quirk of HR 38 is that (I believe) it would allow a person from Kentucky to carry an AR-15 pistol with a 20-round magazine in California, while Californians would not be allowed to carry, or even own, the same equipment. The Supreme Court decision in ‚ÄúD.C. v. Heller,‚Äù whether you agree with it or not, allows states to have some regulations on firearm equipment and eligibility to possess, but HR 38 seems to contradict that framework.

Contrast this with my National Constitutional Carry bill which basically says if a state allows people to possess (KEEP) a particular firearm, that state must also allow people to carry (BEAR) that firearm.

I introduced my National Constitutional Carry bill in committee yesterday as a substitute amendment to HR 38, National Reciprocity. After introducing the amendment for the record and describing it, I withdrew the amendment instead of putting my Judiciary Committee colleagues in the position of deciding whether to replace National Reciprocity with National Constitutional Carry. The dilemma is that not enough Republicans in the whole House understand the difference, and the prevailing opinion is that Reciprocity can pass the whole House, but Constitutional Carry cannot.

Perhaps when more of my colleagues who are not on the Judiciary Committee understand why we should pass National Constitutional Carry instead of (or in addition to) National Reciprocity, we can make a strong push to report National Constitutional Carry out of the Judiciary Committee for a vote in the full House of Representatives. In the meantime, I‚Äôm glad HR 38 is going to the House floor for a vote.",en,Tweet,431,12821,2482,509,228738.0,2025-03-27 00:00:01,"<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web Client</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1905002099991019520/pu/vid/avc1/720x720/PdNra2qIzGw26hb9.mp4?tag=12

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1905661686582743258',"Each week, we honor individuals from across our district whose lives reflect the very best of who we are. This week, we shine a light on a man whose journey is a testament to faith in action and leadership through service. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero: Donald Schuler Jr. of Lower Makefield.
 
Raised by two pastors‚ÄîDonald and Dawn‚Äîfaith and service were a constant part of his upbringing. From a young age, Don was taught true purpose is found in helping others and living with intention. That foundation would guide every step of his journey.
 
Don‚Äôs path of purpose began at Pennsbury High School, where he was known as a thoughtful leader and someone who was looked up to by others. He served as a Student Council senator, played football, volunteered as a Pop Warner coach, and gave countless hours to his community, volunteering and striving to make a difference wherever he could. In 2006, he was named YMCA Youth Volunteer of the Year and received a Senatorial Citation for his service‚Äîearly signs of a young man committed to leading by example.
 
Don's journey took him from the hallways of Pennsbury to the national stage. A dynamic leader and creative voice, his career has spanned industries and inspired audiences nationwide. As an Executive Success Coach, motivational speaker, and innovative storyteller, Don has partnered with major brands such as Google, Verizon, Budweiser, Campbell‚Äôs, and the NBA‚Äîbringing his message of purpose and empowerment to corporate, educational, and community spaces alike. He has delivered TEDx talks, led national speaking tours, and motivated thousands of students to believe in themselves and their potential.
 
Through it all, one thing remained clear: Don‚Äôs heart never left the community that raised him.
 
Today, Don has come home to serve as the Youth Ministries Pastor at The Crossing Church in Washington Crossing. In his newest role, through mentorship, ministry, and everyday presence, Don is helping our students discover who they are, grow in their faith, and realize the power of living with intention. He's not just encouraging them to find their purpose‚Äîhe‚Äôs walking alongside them as they do.
 
In a world where our young people are bombarded with a multitude of distractions, Don is a steady, guiding voice‚Äîhelping them build confidence, character, and a foundation of faith that will carry them into lives of meaning and service.

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration delivered this week:

Speaker Johnson allowed the House to vote on...wait for it...refrigerators. Meanwhile...

The Administration abruptly cancelled $500 million in deliveries to food banks across the country.

@realDonaldTrump signed an Executive Order to end collective bargaining for federal unions, including those at the Department of State, Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Health and Human Services, Treasury, Justice, Commerce and parts of Homeland Security.

@SecDef , @MikeWaltz47 , @DNIGabbard and other high-ranking military, intelligence and Exec Branch officials shared classified information over unsecure messaging platform Signal (after a Pentagon warning to staff not to use it!), inadvertently invited an @TheAtlantic journalist into the chat and then lied about it all, over and over and over again.

President Trump is moving to kneecap states and reshape elections at every level of government to make registering to vote and voting itself more difficult.

President Trump announced he wants to create a ""compensation fund"" for the January 6 criminals he has inexplicably pardoned.

President Trump is erasing our national heritage by demanding the whitewashing of historic information across all 21 of the Smithsonian museums and its 14 education and research centers, as well as Arlington National Cemetery, and is tasking Vice President Vance with the coverup.

President Trump abruptly cancelled $12B in federal grants for states that were using the funds to track infectious diseases, provide mental health services and addiction treatment, and fund the response to the growing measles epidemic, among other initiatives.

Acting-President @elonmusk is dropping millions of dollars into a Wisconsin Supreme Court race to buy another official--this time a judge he expects will be favorable to his pending lawsuit against the state.

@SpeakerJohnson floated the idea of simply getting rid of federal courts or taking away their funding because he and the Administration don't like judges actually upholding the laws of the land.

Four American soldiers died in Lithuania--a Pennsylvania National Guard partner nation--and Trump didn't know anything about it.

These countries issued travel advisories warning their citizens against visiting the United States: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom.

And once again, the Trump Administration is trying to kill @elmo.

"Elfreth, Sarah",Representative,Maryland,3,Democratic,House: 2025-Present,Yes,RepSarahElfreth,'1905722209831879078',"Today, President Trump and Secretary Hegseth decided to end affirmative action at the U.S. Naval Academy. Let me be clear that this will have negative implications on our national security, as well as our military‚Äôs recruitment and retention for decades to come.

Here‚Äôs a simple example: Our sailors represent America in countries all around the world with cultures and practices different from our own. That means diverse and multi-lingual troops can often be the difference between a successful mission and a failure.

That‚Äôs why I believe that a Navy and Marine Corps that reflect the diversity of our country is our strongest Navy and Marine Corps. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I will continue to fight for a military that respects and appreciates the sacrifices and experiences of all servicemembers. It is shameful that our President and Secretary of Defense cannot do the same.

She has not been charged with any crime.

The video of her kidnapping is harrowing. Plainclothes officers wearing masks surrounded her, grabbed her by the wrists, took her phone away, and handcuffed her before taking her away in a vehicle.

She was on her way to break her Ramadan fast, so I can only imagine how hungry and afraid she was. She also does not have her asthma medications with her‚Äîa human rights violation.

This is unacceptable and she must be released immediately and have her visa restored NOW. 

R√ºmeysa is a peaceful protestor, a graduate student at Tufts University passionate about education, and my constituent who has a constitutional right to free speech and due process. She was here legally on a student visa, before it was unjustly revoked, and making numerous positive contributions to the Tufts and #MA7 community.

This administration is terrorizing students to silence dissent because that‚Äôs what a dictator does. And the only reason she was kidnapped is because she has a dissenting political view, different from Donald Trump‚Äôs. That‚Äôs it. 

This should be a five-alarm fire for anyone who cares about free speech and our democracy ‚Äî regardless of your political party, ideology, or opinion on Israel, Palestine, or any other issue.

This is an assault on the core tenets of our democracy. It‚Äôs unlawful, unjust, and authoritarian, and every person of conscience should be outraged and alarmed. Because if they can do it to her, they can do it to anyone else.

Eating disorders affect seniors at rates similar to the general population, but Medicare doesn‚Äôt cover Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for these conditions, leaving seniors & people with disabilities without access to necessary treatment.

Left untreated, eating disorders can lead to heart failure, kidney failure, diabetes, and more, which is why the Nutrition CARE Act is so critical. This bill will help ensure that all individuals with eating disorders can access the services they need to recover and stay healthy.
