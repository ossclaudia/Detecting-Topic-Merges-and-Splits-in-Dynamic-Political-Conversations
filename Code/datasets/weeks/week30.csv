Roy asked then-FBI Director Christopher Wray in July 2023 why FBI Agent Brian Auten was able to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop investigation and participate in the Mar-a-Lago investigation despite being under ""disciplinary review"" for deceiving FISA courts with the Steele Dossier to spy on the Trump campaign. 

Rep. Roy: ""The FBI conducted an internal investigation of Brian Auten and then sought to suspend him but Auten appealed. 

Nevertheless, in 2020, after Senators Grassley and Johnson highlighted evidence of potential financial crimes and corruption against the Biden family, the FBI assigned Auten to compile an assessment, which was used to characterize the Biden revelations as Russian disinformation.  

The evidence Grassley and Johnson had collected was mostly financial records and could easily have been corroborated as authentic. 

And by then, the FBI had the Hunter laptop in its possession for over a year, so it knew the lucrative payments to the Bidens from corrupt anti-American regimes were authentic. 

How on earth did the FBI empower an agent under investigation for potentially corrupt performance and abuse of FISA in one politically fraught investigation, a Democrat operative-driven case against President Trump, to play a key role to undermine a second politically fraught investigation, a case against the Bidens?

I have long believed that the 14th amendment does not require granting citizenship to the children of illegal aliens or foreign nationals here on temporary, nonimmigrant visas. To that end, last year I introduced legislation to limit birthright citizenship.

One of the greatest pull factors for illegal immigration is birthright citizenship. In addition, birth tourism, particularly involving China, is a large industry where people obtain tourist visas for the purpose of giving birth in the U.S. and establishing U.S. citizenship for that child. It is far past time for the United States to recognize the original, constitutional definition of birthright citizenship, as the current practice is being abused in so many ways.

It is my hope the Court will settle this issue once and for all, and that my legislation to stop the abuse of birthright citizenship will pass quickly.

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration delivered this week:

President Trump is openly defying the United States Supreme Court, refusing to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States while also threatening to send US citizens to foreign prisons.

President Trump launched Truth Social investment accounts made up of stocks in companies directly benefiting from his tariff and trade policies.

After not updating its tracking website for nearly a month, DOGE removed hundreds of ""cuts"" they had taken credit for and edited others to try to juice the savings they are claiming.

Sensitive national security information continues to flow out of the Secretary of Defense's office, and multiple political appointees and staffers were escorted out of the Pentagon or placed on administrative leave. Meanwhile, their boss--a chief Signalgate leaker himself--remains uninvestigated and clearly incapable of protecting national secrets.

Trump's choice to lead the IRS had a great week--the nominee had $130K in personal debt paid off by donors who happen to work in tax consulting businesses or are involved in tax-related legal fights.

The Pentagon continued its erasure campaign, this time removing information from its websites about the Air Force's first female Thunderbird pilot and her accomplishments.

The NIH is following suit, as we learned that 38 of the 43 scientists cut from the boards tasked with reviewing science and research happening in NIH laboratories were female, Black or Hispanic.

The federal office responsible for battling foreign disinformation is being eliminated.

E.coli is back! Fifteen states were hit with a deadly outbreak linked to lettuce but the FDA chose not to share this with the American public. Also this week we learned the FDA plans to stop routine food safety inspections.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1913273738365108455',"Each week, we honor members of our community whose strength, compassion, and resilience make a lasting impact. Today, we recognize a family whose faith carried them through the unimaginable‚Äîand who have turned that journey into a mission to serve others. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero: the Masciantonio family of Warrington.
 
Shortly after Gianna Grace Masciantonio was born, her parents, Joe and Kristen, were told she had only weeks to live. An inoperable tumor had wrapped around her brainstem‚Äîaggressive, untreatable, and fatal. With no options left, they turned to the only thing they had‚Äîfaith. And on Christmas Eve, their prayers were answered. A call from a specialist brought a new possibility: the tumor might not be cancer. A biopsy confirmed it‚ÄîGianna had a rare blood disorder known as systemic JXG. The road ahead would be grueling‚Äî20 surgeries, intense chemotherapy, and months in the hospital‚Äîbut their faith held firm.
 
It was their faith that gave them strength through surgeries and long hospital stays, and it was faith that brought them to Philadelphia in 2015 to be near Pope Francis as he visited the city for the World Family. In a moment neither planned nor imagined, Gianna was lifted into the arms of the Holy Father and kissed on the head. For the Masciantonios, it wasn‚Äôt just a blessing but a sign they were not walking this road alone.
 
Today, Gianna is a thriving 10-year-old with a heart as big as her smile. She loves art, baking, horseback riding, and time spent with her cousins and classmates. But more than anything, she loves life. Every moment with her is a reminder of how precious and miraculous each day truly is. And her parents‚ÄîJoe and Kristen‚Äîhave taken their family‚Äôs deepest pain and turned it into a mission of purpose.
 
After enduring unimaginable challenges, they made a promise to help other families facing similar battles with rare and life-threatening pediatric illnesses. This promise led to the creation of the For the Love of Grace Foundation‚Äîa nonprofit organization grounded in faith, compassion, and action. Since its founding, For the Love of Grace has donated nearly $100,000 to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and provided life-changing support to countless local families. Their assistance includes covering medical bills, funding essential home modifications, and creating prayer groups for parents seeking strength and connection. Their motto, Faith Over Fear, is more than just a phrase; it embodies how they live, lead, and uplift others.  
 
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Rare Disease Caucus, I am humbled to work alongside families like the Masciantonios. Their courage is our call to action‚Äîto secure more funding, research, and resources for children and families fighting rare diseases.
 
Joe, Kristen, and Gianna Grace‚Äîyour faith, strength, and generosity have illuminated the way for countless individuals and continue to make a difference in our community and beyond. Thank you for reminding us that even in the darkest times, faith triumphs over fear‚Äîyou are true hometown heroes, and we are grateful for you!",en,Tweet,2,38,5,4,12318.0,2025-04-18 17:49:40,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Go1QUqNXkAAXTyZ.jpg

The men and women who gathered here were not professional soldiers or political elites. They were neighbors and parents. Workers and worshippers. People with families to protect, farms to tend, and lives to live. And yet, when the moment came, they answered history‚Äôs call.
