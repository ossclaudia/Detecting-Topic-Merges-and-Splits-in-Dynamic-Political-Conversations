To celebrate, I attended the Amelia Island Lighthouse Grand Re-Opening. Built in 1838, this is the oldest lighthouse in the state and has stood watch over Florida‚Äôs coastline as a beacon of hope guiding vessels home for nearly two centuries. 

Last year, I got a call from my son who was serving as the Mayor and he informed me the lighthouse needed a new beacon. Our team immediately went to work joining colleagues from Northeast Florida and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary in the effort to refurbish her brilliant beacon. 

Thanks to the dedication of city leaders and the collaboration of our local, state, and federal partners, this historic renovation has come to fruition‚Äîrestoring her beauty and safeguarding her legacy for generations to come.

This lighthouse isn‚Äôt just a landmark to me; it‚Äôs a part of my childhood, a symbol of the community that raised me, and a reminder of how lucky I am to call this place home.

Today, we celebrate a group that has been a pillar of service for nearly 80 years‚Äîmeet this week‚Äôs Hometown Heroes, VFW Post 6393 Yardley Pennsylvania. 
 
Founded in 1946 by local World War II veterans, Post 6393 has continued to answer the call to serve. With over 200 members, they remain a lifeline for veterans, a partner to families, and a cornerstone of our community. Their work spans generations‚Äîhelping our Vietnam veterans secure long-overdue benefits, welcoming our younger veterans of the Global War on Terrorism, and creating a place where every veteran feels valued, respected, and at home.
 
This year, their unmatched record of service was recognized on the national stage as VFW Post 6393 was named the 2025 Outstanding National Community Service Post of the Year for the Eastern Conference‚Äîan honor awarded to only one post in each region of the country. It is among the highest distinctions in the VFW, recognizing not only the dollars donated, hours volunteered, and miles driven, but the lives lifted, restored, and forever changed.
 
Under Commander Kirk Saboda‚Äôs leadership, Post 6393 has set a new standard for what a modern VFW can be‚Äîforward-looking, inclusive, and deeply engaged in every facet of community life. They deliver free, expert guidance to veterans navigating the VA system, run a home repair program that has restored safety and dignity through more than 60 completed projects for older veterans, and have remodeled their facilities to be fully accessible for all. Through the Code Blue initiative with AHTN, they stand watch on the coldest winter nights, ensuring no homeless veteran‚Äîor civilian‚Äîis left without shelter.
 
That same spirit of service extends seamlessly into our broader community. They sponsor Cub Scout Pack 30 and Venture Crew 6393, host Veterans Night to instill patriotism and civic responsibility in young people, and invite Scouts to take an active role in major community fundraisers, including their annual Classic Car Show and Wrangler Fest. Their poppy campaigns at Easter, Memorial Day, and Veterans Day fuel an emergency relief fund‚Äîready to cover heating bills, urgent home repairs, and other critical needs at a moment‚Äôs notice.
 
Whether folding the flag with a Cub Scout, repairing a veteran‚Äôs home, mentoring the next generation, or standing shoulder-to-shoulder with a neighbor in crisis, Post 6393 lives its creed every single day: ‚ÄúNo one does more for veterans.‚Äù
 
Over the years, I have had the honor of working alongside these extraordinary patriots‚Äîhearing their stories, learning from their hard-earned wisdom, and witnessing the depth of their impact firsthand. Their insight has shaped my work, their friendship is a privilege, and their steadfast partnership in serving our community is one of my greatest honors. I am proud to call these heroes not only partners in service, but true friends.

That‚Äôs a core tenet of successful counterinsurgency operations, as we learned in Iraq and Afghanistan. A military occupation of Gaza with no endgame is a dead end.

Despite pushback from Israel‚Äôs military leadership, the extremists in Netanyahu‚Äôs government see full occupation as a way to cling to power, expel Palestinians, expand settlements, and pave the way for annexation. That is not a plan for peace. Netanyahu‚Äôs statement that Israel does not want to govern Gaza and wants to hand it over to Arab forces is the right idea, but he must agree to, and support, a credible plan for Gaza‚Äôs political future: one that's both free from Hamas and built in the best interest of Palestinians. That is the only road to lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians.

In parallel, it‚Äôs critical that the humanitarian needs of Palestinians are addressed immediately.

Russell had worked as a ground crew member, partly so he could visit his family in Alaska more often. Though he had no formal flight training other than playing video games, he developed a deep fascination with aviation. On the evening of August 10th, he gained access to an aircraft and took off smoothly, only drawing attention once fellow employees realized something was wrong.

During his flight, Russell flew over Mount Rainier and the Olympic Mountains, did a barrel roll, and even requested GPS coordinates for a recently sighted orca and calf.

Air traffic controllers, two F-15 fighter jets, and a civilian pilot tried to persuade him to land, but their efforts were unsuccessful. When the plane eventually ran out of fuel, Russell guided it into Ketron Island. His death was ruled a suicide, possibly linked to past brain injuries from multiple concussions.

Nothing. He spoke at a Democrat convention. But Laura Loomer has ZERO respect or reverence for even the most heroic people in America. Ask any veteran, military member, and American, no one cares about his politics, the man was willing to die to save others from a suicide bomber.

Shut up Laura.

‚û°Ô∏è The ‚Äúcoverage loss‚Äù you cite stems from the state‚Äôs provider tax payments. The state made a commitment to fund 10% of Medicaid ‚Äì the federal government will continue to cover our 90%, and actually increase funding. The federal government will continue to honor our commitment.

‚û°Ô∏è Our bill does nothing to impact Medicaid benefits for mothers and children.

‚û°Ô∏è The people who will lose access to Medicaid under our bill are able-bodied individuals who choose not to work, or are already ineligible to receive benefits under the program. This plan is simply the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid. 

‚û°Ô∏è You claim that 35 rural Kentucky hospitals will close as a result of our bill. Last week, I visited several rural hospitals in my district that you claim will close because of our bill. Every single one of them has said they will stay open providing care to Kentuckians.

Again, enough with the attempts to scare people. Being a leader means making responsible decisions for taxpayers and the most vulnerable in our Commonwealth.

DC‚Äôs violent crime rate has been going down for the last decade.

One of best ways to help cities fight crime is funding community policing programs that have reduced¬†violent crime rates in some cities by as much as 50%.
¬†
But the President has cut these community programs, Byrne JAG, and other grants by $500 million.
¬†
The U.S. Attorney General should let DC mayor Muriel Bowser do her job and the FBI should do theirs. Which means the FBI fighting money laundering, sex trafficking and combatting drug trafficking.¬†
¬†
If the President really wanted to fight crime in our cities, he would create a Fentanyl Task Force with the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and local law enforcement sharing resources and working collaboratively to tackle this scourge. This approach is showing great success on one of our worse crime problems--Fentanyl.
