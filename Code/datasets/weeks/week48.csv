The Korean Axe Murder incident took place a few days before on August 18 when a group of soldiers were pruning a tree planted by Kim Il-Sung. After 15 minutes of trimming, North Korea sent a truckload of soldiers to the site, who swiftly killed the soldiers with the axes used for pruning.

A few days later, Operation Paul Bunyan was carried out to cut down the tree rather than merely prune it. Task Force Vierra, consisting of 813 personnel, included 23 American and South Korean vehicles equipped with chainsaws, two 30-man security platoons, a 64-man South Korean special forces unit, 27 U.S. helicopters, several jets from both America and South Korea, infantry, artillery, and the 71st Air Defense Regiment.

"Stefanik, Elise M.",Representative,New York,21,Republican,House: 2015-Present,Yes,RepStefanik,'1958565612310999214',"Today‚Äôs decision by the New York appeals court to throw out the outrageous and unprecedented $464 million judgment against President Trump is a resounding victory for justice, the rule of law, and the American people. This sham case, orchestrated by radical Democrat Attorney General Letitia James as part of her partisan witch hunt against President Trump, has been exposed for what it always was: a blatant abuse of power and weaponization of our judicial system to interfere in elections and silence political opponents.

From the outset, I have fought tirelessly against this injustice. As a proud New Yorker and defender of our Constitution, I filed an ethics complaint with the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct against Judge Arthur Engoron for his inappropriate bias, judicial intemperance, and repeated violations of judicial ethics including illegal political donations by his staff and unconstitutional gag orders that silenced President Trump. I supplemented this complaint multiple times to highlight the egregious misconduct that undermined public confidence in our courts and turned this trial into a political spectacle. I also filed formal complaints to disbar our disgraceful New York Attorney General Letitia James for her blatant bias and highly inappropriate and prejudicial comments on social media related to this sham case. 

This ruling vindicates not only President Trump but also the countless Americans harmed by the Far Left's illegal weaponized lawfare tactics. Letitia James and her allies must be held accountable for their corrupt actions, and I will continue to lead the charge in Congress to expose and end this weaponization of government.

President Trump has always put America First, and the American people stand with him. We will not allow Far Left Democrats to subvert our Constitutional Republic.

Fentanyl is not a distant problem‚Äîit is the crisis of our time. It is now the leading cause of death for young Americans, often hidden in counterfeit pills that look safe but contain a fatal dose.

‚û°Ô∏è Just one pill can kill.

Behind every life lost is a story unfinished‚Äîa son or daughter, a classmate, a teammate, a friend. Each tragedy leaves a family shattered and a community forever changed.

As Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health & Substance Use Disorder Task Force, I am continuing my work to change that by:

‚úÖ Driving nationwide prevention efforts to educate teens and families and cut through the silence and stigma
‚úÖ Forging partnerships with schools, healthcare providers, and law enforcement so communities are equipped to act
‚úÖ Delivering federal resources to expand treatment, recovery, and life-saving tools for families on the frontlines
‚úÖ Advancing bipartisan legislation to crack down on counterfeit pills, hold traffickers accountable, expand prevention, and save lives

But prevention must also begin at home:

üõë Talk openly about the dangers of fentanyl and counterfeit pills
üõë Never share or take someone else‚Äôs medication
üõë Store prescriptions securely and out of reach of children, teens, and pets
üõë Safely dispose of unused medications through FDA or DEA take-back programs to prevent misuse
üõë Know the warning signs of an overdose‚Äîclammy skin, blue lips or fingertips, gurgling noises, or slowed breathing‚Äîand call 911 immediately

Later, in 1989, I was one of a small group of people chosen to participate in a special conference at the Focus on Family headquarters that led to the founding of the Alabama Family Alliance, that later became the Alabama Policy Institute, as part of a national network of family policy councils. In that regard, Dr. Dobson has had a huge impact in Alabama.

I last talked with him in May and had a chance to thank him for all he has meant to countless millions of people and to my family and me. He was, without question, one of the most influential American leaders in the last 50 years whose voice impacted the lives of millions of families promoting a culture based on the biblical values needed to sustain our nation at a time when those values have been under relentless attack. His more than 70 books and weekday radio broadcast covered the full spectrum of marriage and family from couples just starting out to finishing well in our later years.

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1958863030281805844',"On this day in history in 1992, the infamous Ruby Ridge standoff continued. 

Randy Weaver and his family lived atop a mountain in remote Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Weaver was targeted by the government after selling two sawed-off shotguns to an Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearm (ATF) informant working to catch him. Weaver was let off on bail but failed to appear at court after his defense provided him with the wrong court date. 

After this, ATF handed the case over to the US Marshals, who began surveillance on Weaver and his property by installing various cameras. On August 21, Weaver, his friend, Kevin Harris, his 14 year-old son, Sammy, chased after their dog, Striker, on the family property. They came across an armed, camouflaged man who failed to state that he was a federal agent. The marshal shot and killed the dog before pointing his gun at Sammy, causing Sammy to shoot at the marshal. Sammy was shot in the back while running away from the unmarked agent.

The Weaver family refused to surrender, and the standoff began. The US Marshals then handed the case to the FBI, conveying that a militia group killed a federal agent. Neighbors were evacuated from their homes, roads near Ruby Ridge were closed, and the governor declared a state of emergency. 

The next day, an FBI sniper 200 yards away shot and wounded Weaver and Harris and fatally shot his wife, Vicki Weaver, who was holding their infant daughter.

Nine days later, on August 31, Harris, Weaver, and his three daughters surrendered.

Weaver was initially tried, but was acquitted on all charges except for the original charges of the violation of bail and failure to appear. Weaver filed a civil lawsuit and won over $3 million.",en,Tweet,12,309,58,46,13789.0,2025-08-22 13:05:14,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gy9HigZXsAAYkvj.jpg

Today, we shine a light on one of our own who has risen to the very top of his field while never forgetting where he came from. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero, Robert ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Costa of Lower Makefield.
 
Bob has just been named this year‚Äôs recipient of the National Press Club‚Äôs prestigious Fourth Estate Award‚Äîthe highest honor in American journalism. It is reserved for those whose work has changed the way we understand our democracy and the institutions that shape it. And now, alongside legends like Walter Cronkite, Andrea Mitchell, and Tom Brokaw, stands a proud graduate of Pennsbury High School.
 
From editing the school paper and serving as senior class president, even landing John Mayer to play the senior prom, to covering music for the Bucks County Courier Times and interning with my late brother, Mike Fitzpatrick, Bob‚Äôs story has always been rooted here at home. He went on to the Washington Post, co-authored a best-selling book with Bob Woodward, and today serves as a national correspondent for CBS Sunday Morning and chief Washington analyst for CBS News.
 
But what makes this honor so meaningful is not only Bob‚Äôs remarkable career, but how he‚Äôs carried Bucks County with him every step of the way. Growing up here, surrounded by neighbors with so many different perspectives, taught him to listen first. As he‚Äôs said: ‚ÄúPeople can, in good faith, have different perspectives. You have to listen to your neighbor and not expect that everyone has the same view.‚Äù I share that belief. It‚Äôs at the heart of who we are in Bucks County: disagreement does not have to mean division, and listening is the foundation of both democracy and community.
 
From Pennsbury‚Äôs classrooms to the halls of CBS News, Bob has carried that spirit with him‚Äîand today, the nation honors it with journalism‚Äôs highest prize.
 
Please join me in congratulating @costareports on this well-deserved recognition‚Äîand in thanking him for continuing to make Bucks County proud.",en,Tweet,2,14,4,6,2147.0,2025-08-22 17:11:25,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gy9_44wW8AA9Mkx.jpg

The 2024 Uniform Crime Report shows violent crime and murder rates in cities like Laredo and Rio Grande City are far lower than the national average and dramatically below many large U.S. cities.

For example, Detroit recorded a murder rate of 31.17 per 100,000 residents. Baltimore, 34.8.

In Laredo, the rate was 2.32 and in Rio Grande City, zero.

Safety is more than a number ‚Äì it‚Äôs families walking to church with peace of mind, parents sending their kids to school, and workers heading to the job site knowing their community is secure.

The FBI‚Äôs latest data shows cities along the border like Laredo and Rio Grande City continue to have some of the lowest crime rates in the nation.

This safety is possible because of the dedication of our officers, community leaders, and families who work together every day. In Congress, I have delivered resources to keep it that way, including nearly $58 million for Webb County through Operation Stonegarden and almost $8 million to hire new police officers in Laredo, along with millions more for community policing and school safety.

"Sullivan, Dan",Senator,Alaska,,Republican,Senate: 2015-Present,Yes,SenDanSullivan,'1960105315170738242',"The strategic importance of Alaska has been demonstrated time and time again this summer. Just in the last few days, there have been two Russian incursions into our airspace, which our Alaska-based military, once again, professionally intercepted and sent packing back to Russia. Additionally, our military and Coast Guard have been closely monitoring Chinese vessels in the Arctic Ocean near our EEZ that are supposedly conducting research‚Äîpotentially as a cover for more nefarious objectives. But most importantly, all branches of our military and some allied partners, have been conducting two important military exercises in our state throughout August‚ÄîArctic Edge and Northern Edge‚Äîto train homeland security, combat readiness, and power projection capabilities in the Arctic and Indo-Pacific in the event of a major contingency with one of our adversaries.

The training in Alaska of our military, particularly the Joint Pacific-Alaska Range Complex (JPARC), is unrivaled anywhere in the world. As part of this exercise and challenging training, top uniformed and civilian leaders have come to Alaska, including INDOPACOM Commander Admiral Sam ‚ÄúPappy‚Äù Paparo, NORTHCOM Commander Greg ‚ÄúClete‚Äù Guillot, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Chris Grady, and importantly the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment, the Honorable Dale Marks, whose portfolio is critical to Alaska. I‚Äòve traveled around the state with these fine military officers and leaders‚Äîincluding visits to JBER, Fort Greely, and meetings with the 11th Airborne Division‚Äîto watch the outstanding training throughout Alaska this month. I want to thank all of them for being up here and, in particular, thank Admiral Grady, who will be retiring in September after 42 years of Naval service to our great nation.

We discussed all kinds of important issues for Alaska and our nation, including plans to reopen the naval base at Adak on the Aleutian Island Chain, Alaska energy for our forces, and the importance of increased Naval and Marine Corps presence and operations in Alaska. In that regard, I had the opportunity to fly out to the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) carrier strike group off the coast of Alaska, which is participating in Northern Edge. It is remarkable and humbling to watch a carrier strike group in operation knowing that the average age of the over 5,000 sailors and Marines on the USS Abraham Lincoln‚Äîone of the great instruments of American power‚Äîis about 23 years old. These brave service members are conducting important operations that establish credible deterrence in the North Pacific and help mold the sailors and aviators of the strike group into the most lethal force on planet earth. Of course, on that visit, I had the honor of visiting with some young Alaskans who are deployed aboard the Lincoln, all of whom make us all very proud.",en,Tweet,10,112,32,20,3265.0,2025-08-25 23:21:38,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1960103275438682112/vid/avc1/1280x720/5NUuLKXDC5JxpPjs.mp4?tag=21

We have already seen the results in Washington, D.C. The presence of the National Guard has restored order by reestablishing the rule of law, and the city has now gone nearly two weeks without a single murder. That is a sad commentary on how poorly the city has been run, but it also shows just how effective strong leadership and decisive action can be.

If the President is able to replicate those results in Chicago, it would mean safer neighborhoods for families living there and fewer lives lost to violent crime. But it does not stop at the city limits. When crime is reduced in major hubs like Chicago, it strengthens safety across the entire region, including here in Wisconsin. What helps protect Chicagoans also helps protect Wisconsinites.
