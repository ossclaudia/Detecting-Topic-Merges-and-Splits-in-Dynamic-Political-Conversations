Richard Lawrence, an unemployed painter, tried to shoot Jackson as he was leaving a funeral at the Capitol. However, his gun misfired. Jackson, 67, responded by attacking Lawrence with his cane. During the struggle, Lawrence drew a second pistol, but it misfired as well. Jackson's aides then subdued Lawrence, leaving the president unharmed but shaken. 

Although Lawrence appeared mentally unstable and had no known political connections, Jackson believed his assassination attempt was orchestrated by his Whig Party opponents, who were at odds with him over his efforts to dismantle the Bank of the United States. 

Despite no evidence to support this claim, Jackson remained paranoid, and his vice president, Martin Van Buren, began carrying two loaded pistols for protection. Lawrence was committed to a mental institution, and later tests showed both of his pistols malfunctioned by chance, with the odds of such a misfire calculated at 1 in 125,000.",en,Tweet,3,95,12,10,4590.0,2025-01-30 12:30:48,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiipELFWQAAX7qj.jpg

This devastating accident resulted in the expected loss of all passengers and crew members on both aircraft.

Among those lost were U.S. Army pilots and members of the U.S. figure skating team, along with their families and coaches, who were returning home from a competition. As we learn more about this heartbreaking event, it is evident how profound this loss is for so many communities.

I extend my deepest condolences to the families who have lost loved ones. Our thoughts and prayers are with them this morning‚Äîprayers for the families of the passengers and soldiers, for all who were on board, and for the brave, hard-working first responders who spent the night in rescue and recovery efforts.

Preliminary reports indicate that both the helicopter and airplane were operating on standard aviation paths, suggesting this was a terrible accident.

As my good friend and colleague Rep. Ron Estes said, ‚Äúit is a real tragedy.‚Äù I am thankful to hear that the Kansas Congressional delegation is safe.

There will be discussions about improving and modernizing our transportation system to prevent future tragedies as air travel becomes more congested, but today is not that day.

Yesterday, @POTUS signed a pivotal executive order to address this discrimination against our Jewish communities. This is a critical first step.

By expanding enforcement and monitoring tools, increasing reporting requirements, and holding institutions accountable, this executive order will help protect Jewish students and communities from further discrimination, vandalism, and violence.

Part of that accountability is to do what I proposed months ago and raised with Secretary of State Rubio in his confirmation hearing - foreign nationals who incite violence or endorse terrorist activity by supporting Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and attacks against Jews are in violation of the terms of their visas and should no longer be welcomed as guests of America.

Today, we recognize a remarkable woman whose passion for mentorship has opened doors for countless young people, empowering them to reach heights they never thought possible. Meet this week's Hometown Hero‚ÄîLeah Lovelace-Square, the 2025 Student Leader winner of the @Bucks_edu MLK Leadership Award.
 
A Guided Studies major at BCCC, Leah is pursuing concentrations in Management, Leadership, Entrepreneurship & Business, and Culture & Society‚Äîfields that perfectly reflect her commitment to developing future leaders and fostering opportunities for young people in our community.
 
Leah was raised in a military family and their journey took her across four states and three countries. At Baumholder American High School in Germany, she experienced firsthand the life-changing impact of mentorship and leadership programs. What began as an opportunity became a calling‚Äîto ensure every young person has access to guidance, empowerment, and the chance to build a future without limits.
 
Since 2010, Leah has dedicated herself to mentoring young people, helping them see beyond obstacles and dream beyond limitations. And, in 2022, she founded P.U.U.S.H. (Pushing Underprivileged, Underestimated Students Higher), offering faith-inspired awareness and development programs to enhance academic excitement, life-skill training, and leadership opportunities for students who might otherwise be left behind.
 
Through P.U.U.S.H., Leah is giving young people in our community a seat at the table and the skills and confidence to take the lead. By supporting and empowering young people, Leah is continuing the legacy of Dr. King and making a real difference in the lives of countless students and, in turn, strengthening our entire community. Her work is a testament to the power of belief, the importance of mentorship, and the profound truth that potential exists in every young person....sometimes, they just need a little push.
 
Please join me in celebrating Leah Lovelace-Square for her outstanding contributions and this well-deserved recognition as the MLK Leadership Student Leader Award recipient.

They are trying to acquire a nuclear weapon as part of their religious agenda to purify their faith, destroy the Jewish State, and drive Westerners out of the Middle East. A nuclear-armed Iran is an existential threat to Israel and a nightmare for the world.

This resolution clearly demonstrates that the Iranian regime is lying when it says they only want nuclear power and not a nuclear weapon. This is not an authorization for the use of military force, but a resolution establishing the truth regarding Iran‚Äôs nuclear intentions and capability.

Finally, I‚Äôd like to recognize the leadership of my colleagues, @SenFettermanPA and @SenKatieBritt  and @RepMoskowitz  and @RepMikeLawler, on the issue of countering a nuclear-armed Iran.

As a licensed cosmetologist in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, she does more than style hair‚Äîshe provides guidance on family, faith, finances, and fitness. For over 26 years, she has built deep relationships with her clients, offering support that extends far beyond beauty.

But it‚Äôs her work outside the salon that truly defines her impact. After losing her mother, Pamela D. Page, to domestic violence, Natakey turned her pain into purpose, founding the Pamela D. Page Foundation to support survivors. The foundation provides advocacy, education, and therapeutic support through initiatives like the annual 5K walk/run, Life After Trauma Gala, and Hair & Fashion Show.

Beyond events, Natakey‚Äôs foundation hosts workshops, mental health fairs, and support programs for survivors and families. As a survivor herself, she knows the power of community and works tirelessly to create safe spaces for healing. In recognition of her impact, Natakey was honored with the 2025 Humanity Service Award from the City of Rocky Mount.

Thank you, Natakey, for your unwavering commitment to making a difference.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C.‚ÄîToday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna (FL-13) introduced the House companion bill to the Refugees Using Legal Entry Safely (RULES) Act introduced by Senator Bernie Moreno (OH) earlier this year in the United States Senate. This bill seeks to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to modify the eligibility requirements for asylum, thereby deterring and prohibiting the abuse of the system and ensuring its integrity.

‚ÄúThe days of open-border chaos are over. I‚Äôm joining Senator Moreno in introducing the RULES Act to put an end to the rampant fraud and abuse in our asylum system. America is a nation of law and order‚Äînot a free-for-all for illegal aliens gaming the system,‚Äù said Congresswoman Luna. ‚ÄúIf you want asylum in the greatest country on Earth, you follow our rules, period. No more loopholes, no more catch-and-release, no more second chances for lawbreakers. We are taking our border back.‚Äù

The introduction of the RULES Act in the House is a decisive step in strengthening the integrity of America‚Äôs asylum system. The bill establishes that the only way to claim asylum will be through a legal port of entry in the United States. Additionally, those applying cannot be released or paroled into the country before their cases are adjudicated. Additionally, individuals who have previously been denied asylum will not be able to reapply, and those who have entered the U.S. illegally in the past will be ineligible from applying for this most cherished humanitarian help.

Congresswoman Luna continues her fight to ensure the United States immigration system is under control and protects the interests of the American people.",en,Tweet,17,765,143,32,19677.0,2025-01-31 21:54:50,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GipzoJ4WEAAwfWj.jpg

This policy, initially introduced in 1915, declared the waters around the British Isles a war zone, where German U-boats would attack all merchant ships, including those from neutral nations. The sinking of the British Lusitania, which killed 1,201 people including 128 Americans, led to strong condemnation from the U.S. and a demand for Germany to cease attacking unarmed merchant vessels. 

Afterwards, Germany had limited U-boat attacks, but the navy continued to push for a more aggressive strategy. By early 1917, Germany's military leadership convinced Kaiser Wilhelm to approve resuming unrestricted submarine warfare, believing it could lead to victory by that fall. Despite opposition from the Chancellor, who feared antagonizing the U.S., the kaiser supported the decision, and he announced the resumption of unrestricted U-boat warfare, declaring Germany would ""stake everything"" and fight to the end.",en,Tweet,0,21,4,2,3645.0,2025-02-01 12:03:15,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gis18E5XIAACI2V.jpg

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1886048099807768637',"Yes I support President Trump‚Äôs tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China.

Here is why. üëá

An average of 300 Americans are murdered every single day from fentanyl that comes directly from China into Mexico and Canada then the Mexican cartels smuggle it into America through both borders.

Yes there are Mexican cartels operating in Canada now.

Canada and Mexico have not stopped the multi billion dollar Mexican cartels from the intense flow of human trafficking and drug trafficking across our southern border and northern border and China has not stopped sending poisonous fentanyl to the Mexican cartels to murder our people.

And it‚Äôs not just fentanyl, the horrifying effects of drug and human trafficking are the decay of our society, and Americans have been forced to pay for it all by our inept leaders. 

Shame on the governments of Canada, Mexico, and China for what they have done to America.

While trade accounts for 67% of Canada‚Äôs GDP, 73% of Mexico‚Äôs GDP, and 37%
of China‚Äôs GDP, it accounts for only 24% of U.S. GDP. However, in 2023 the U.S.
trade deficit in goods was the world‚Äôs largest at over $1 trillion.

We will win this trade war. 

America is tired of getting kicked in the teeth by the rest of the world and Americans are fed up with American leaders that are weak and afraid.

Tariffs are a powerful, proven source of leverage for protecting our national
interest. 

President Trump is using the tools at hand and taking decisive action that
puts Americans‚Äô safety and our national security first.

Finally we have a President that is willing to put AMERICA FIRST and I fully support him!!!",en,Tweet,672,26430,5848,3991,682170.0,2025-02-02 13:44:42,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

**‚ÄúFirst they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out‚Äî

Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out‚Äî

For Hunter's project, he constructed two rehabilitation shelters for the Aark Wildlife Rehabilitation and Education Center in Chalfont. These shelters will provide a safe and secure environment for injured wildlife to heal before being returned to their natural habitat. His efforts strengthen local conservation initiatives and ensure that AARK can continue its mission of protecting and rehabilitating wildlife.

Matthew's project involved transforming an underutilized area at the Bensalem Senior Citizen Center Memorial Garden into a sanctuary for remembrance and reflection. By creating a space where families can gather, honor their loved ones with commemorative bricks, and hold celebrations of life, Matthew has provided the community with a venue that will offer comfort for years to come. Both projects serve as a testament to the idea that true leadership involves leaving things better than you found them.

I was also pleased to attend the Blue and Gold Scout Banquet Ceremonies in Morrisville and Bensalem today, where the next generation of Scouts are learning the same values of leadership and service that Hunter and Matthew have exemplified.

While the funding freeze has been rescinded, this administration has made it will stop at nothing to reduce funding for essential programs, putting millions at risk.

Clinicas provides vital care to our most vulnerable populations, and its mission relies heavily on stable federal support. Cuts to Medicaid and other essential services could force local health providers to scale back their operations or even turn away patients, further jeopardizing access to health care for those who need it most.

In #VenturaCounty alone, over 265,000 residents depend on Medi-Cal to access necessary healthcare. In California alone, over 14 million people rely on this program. Medi-Cal is not just health insurance‚Äì it‚Äôs a lifeline for children, working families, seniors, and people with disabilities.

These tariffs, essentially a Trump Tax, will raise the cost of food, housing, gas, and cars, all of which are essentials that families depend on every single day. 

For example, the price of groceries like avocados and maple syrup will go up. Building a home or buying a car will become more expensive. Even gas prices could rise because these tariffs disrupt supply chains. Families trying to get by will feel the squeeze, and for what? These tariffs do not protect American workers; they punish American consumers. What happened to helping the American people? These tariffs do the opposite. 

They make it harder for families to put food on the table, keep a roof over their heads, and afford basic transportation. This Trump Tax is not what voters expected or deserved.

We must act now to help @POTUS right the ship and make our economy strong again for all Americans.

"Lee, Mike",Senator,Utah,,Republican,Senate: 2011-Present,Yes,SenMikeLee,'1886808480712917228',"RESOLUTION  

Expressing the vital importance of the Panama Canal to the United States.

Whereas early efforts of the Colombian government and French investors to construct a canal across Panama were unsuccessful and resulted in bankruptcy by 1889;  

Whereas, as a condition of United States Government support for Panama‚Äôs independence from Colombia, including the positioning of United States troops in the then-territory of Panama, the United States was to be assured access to construct and control a canal in perpetuity, an agreement that culminated in the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, signed at Washington November 18, 1903;  

Whereas the Panama Canal was never initiated, engineered, or built by the Panamanian government;

Whereas the United States Government funded, pioneered, and built the Panama Canal over a 10-year period from 1904 to 1914, at a cost of $375,000,000 and 10,000 lives, and raised the canal above sea level through construction of a lock system;  

Whereas, historically, the Panama Canal has been distinct from the sovereign territory of Panama;

Whereas the Panama Canal serves as a vital connection between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, connecting the east and west coasts of the United States and providing passage for more than 14,000 vessels in 2023;  

Whereas approximately 72 percent of vessels traveling through the Panama Canal are traveling to or from United States ports;  

Whereas, without the Panama Canal, vessels would have to pass through the notoriously dangerous Cape Horn, extending transit by nearly 8,000 miles;  

Whereas, in 1977, President Carter surrendered United States control over the Panama Canal in a series of trea- ties with Panama known as the ‚Äò‚ÄòTorrijos-Carter Trea- ties‚Äô‚Äô;  

Whereas one of those treaties, the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, signed at Washington September 7, 1977, otherwise known as the ‚Äò‚ÄòNeutrality Treaty‚Äô‚Äô, reserved the right of the United States to use armed force to defend the permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal;  

Whereas, for nearly a decade, the People‚Äôs Republic of China has steadily increased its footprint in the Panama Canal;  

Whereas, in 2016, Panama ceded control of Margarita Island, the Panama Canal‚Äôs largest Atlantic port, to the People‚Äôs Republic of China-affiliated Landbridge Group in a $900,000,000 agreement;  

Whereas, in 2018, Panama entered into a $1,400,000,000 agreement for the China Communications Construction Company and the China Harbor Engineering Company to construct the fourth bridge across the Panama Canal;  

Whereas CK Hutchison Holdings, based in Hong Kong, manages two of the Panama Canal‚Äôs five ports, including the Balboa port along the Pacific and Cristobal port along the Atlantic;  

Whereas the rapid acceleration of Chinese influence in the Panama Canal poses a high risk of intelligence-gathering and surveillance by the People‚Äôs Republic of China;  

Whereas Chinese law requires the assets of civilian firms to be made available to support the armed forces of the People‚Äôs Republic of China;  

Whereas the Panama Canal would serve as a logistics point between the east and west coasts of the United States in the event of a conflict involving United States Armed Forces, cementing its value to homeland and hemispheric defense;  

Whereas the ability of the People‚Äôs Republic of China to control major entry and exit points of the Panama Canal would provide the People‚Äôs Republic of China with a significant military advantage relevant to United States Armed Forces in the event of a conflict:  

Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate‚Äî  

(1) recognizes the ingenuity and labor of Americans that made the Panama Canal possible for future generations, with special regard for those Americans who lost their lives in pursuit of the Panama Canal project;  

(2) expresses that the Panama Canal is vital to United States regional security, hemispheric hegemony, and economic interests;  

(3) assesses that a pattern of Chinese-backed investment in port infrastructure and canal operations in Panama constitutes a violation of the Neutrality Treaty; and  

(4) urges the Trump administration to ensure that the canal remains neutral and to take all appropriate measures to enforce the Neutrality Treaty.
