The Great Hurricane of 1780 was an extraordinarily destructive storm that struck the Caribbean. Its precise origin and strength remain uncertain due to the absence of modern storm-tracking technology at the time. 

The hurricane is believed to have first made landfall in Barbados, subsequently ravaging other parts of the eastern Caribbean over the following week. The islands of Barbados, Martinique, and St. Lucia were particularly hard hit, suffering thousands of casualties and widespread destruction of property. 

During this period, both Great Britain and France were engaged in the American Revolutionary War, and numerous naval vessels from both nations were present in the Caribbean. Many of these ships were lost to the storm, further complicating wartime efforts.

Despite numerous deadly hurricanes since 1780, only Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which resulted in over 11,000 deaths in Central America, has come close to the catastrophic toll of the Great Hurricane.",en,Tweet,2,20,5,1,2228.0,2024-10-10 12:33:18,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZhp18RWAAASYvB.jpg

"Smith, Adam",Representative,Washington,9,Democratic,House: 1997-Present,Yes,RepAdamSmith,'1844471015146963138',"I released a new statement calling for stability and de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

The continued conflict in Gaza, the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the ongoing proxy war with Iran, the fight with the Houthis, the fight with Iranian proxies in Syria ‚Äî all of these conflicts are devastating to the civilian population and continue to place significant numbers of civilians at risk across Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere. Each of these conflicts runs the risk of massive escalation.

The international community needs to recognize that Iran remains the main driver of this conflict. They have backed Hezbollah, the Houthis, Hamas, and other Shia militias in Iraq and Syria for years. Israel is threatened by these extremist proxy groups that continually try to exterminate their country, some of whom explicitly have as their motto ‚Äúdeath to the U.S., death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews.‚Äù This rhetoric and their attempts to destroy Israel through missiles or terrorist attacks is abominable. Israel has a right to defend itself against these existential threats. However, even as we understand Israel‚Äôs motivations to fight back against these extremist groups, the risk of escalation and the cost to the civilian population puts Israel and others in the region at even greater risk.

The only way out of this regional conflict is to have a coalition of the U.S., Israel, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E., Jordan, Qatar, and other Arab states as a deterrence to Iran. That will never happen if there isn‚Äôt a future for the Palestinian people. While I understand Israel‚Äôs response to the threat from Iran and all of their proxies, I am adamantly opposed to Israel‚Äôs approach to the West Bank. It is unacceptable for Israel to continue to press claims into the West Bank that have no support in international law. It is also completely unacceptable for Israel to not have a plan for a post-Hamas future for Palestinians in Gaza. Peace will never be achieved unless there is a future for the Palestinian people.

Ceasefire negotiations have never been more important. I support the Biden Administration‚Äôs continued efforts to bring parties in the region together to achieve that ceasefire in Gaza, Lebanon, and Israel.",en,Tweet,2,9,7,11,2526.0,2024-10-10 21:12:13,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZjgbpcXYAA1gIY.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZjgdm4W0AoyycS.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZjgdm4XQAEC6ZY.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZjgdm4WsAk54pz.jpg"

‚ÄúPrime Time‚Äù began his day with the Atlanta Falcons facing the Miami Dolphins at the Orange Bowl, where they lost 21-17. In that game, Sanders showcased his versatility by returning two kicks, a punt, and catching a nine-yard pass, all while contributing to a defense tasked with containing the legendary Dan Marino.

Immediately after the game, Sanders flew to Pittsburgh for Game 5 of the 1992 NLCS with the Atlanta Braves. He arrived still in his Falcons gear, unprepared for the 53-degree weather. Although he did not see any action in the Braves' 7-1 defeat to the Pirates, his mere presence was historic; had he played, he would have been the first athlete to compete in two major American professional sports on the same day.

A week later, Sanders had another opportunity to make history, with the Falcons facing the 49ers and the Braves hosting the Blue Jays for Game 2 of the World Series. However, he opted to remain in Atlanta, starting in left field. He recorded one hit and two walks in a closely contested 5-4 loss to the Blue Jays.

Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Heroes‚ÄîChristy Murphy and the incredible @bcdragonboat Women's Senior A Team.
 
This is not just a tale of athletic triumph, although their accomplishments on the water are nothing short of extraordinary. Led by the incredible Chris and Jaquelyn Wetzel, the Bucks County Dragon Boat Association (BCDBA) recently competed on the world stage in Ravenna, Italy, against the top dragon boat teams from around the globe. They brought home two silver medals and a gold‚Äîan achievement that speaks volumes about their talent, determination, and dedication. But as impressive as these victories are, their most profound accomplishment wasn‚Äôt measured in medals but in saving a life.
 
On September 3rd, following a grueling 2000-meter race that earned them the silver medal, Christy Murphy and her Women's Senior A teammates were paddling back to the docks when they saw a man in the water, struggling to stay afloat. It was a moment that could have paralyzed many with fear, but instead, it became a moment of pure heroism. Without a second thought, Christy sprang into action, drawing on the same strength, precision, and teamwork that had carried them through the race. She knew every second was crucial.
 
With her teammates rallying behind her, Christy plunged into the water and swam to the struggling man. With the help of her teammates, they pulled him onto their boat and safely transferred him to the motor rescue they had flagged down. On that day, this remarkable group of Bucks County women did not just prove themselves as world-class athletes‚Äîthey showed us all what it means to be true heroes. This extraordinary and selfless act transcends any medal or title, reminding us of the power of human connection, teamwork, and what we are capable of when we come together.

The extension of the Individuals and Households Program (IHP), including Financial Assistance and Direct Temporary Housing Assistance was originally set to end on February 10, 2025, but will now be extended to February 10, 2026.

There are currently 1,194 households occupying FEMA-provided units, and with this extension, survivors housed in temporary FEMA units will be able to continue working on their permanent housing plan and start paying rent, depending on their financial ability.

Occupants who provide documentation of their post-disaster income that meets or is below HUD‚Äôs very low-income limit will qualify for fully reduced rent of $50 per month without having to appeal and submit documentation of pre- or post-disaster housing costs.

Occupants with household incomes above the HUD very low-income limit will only have to provide documentation of post-disaster housing costs for FEMA to evaluate the amount of rent to be charged based on their financial ability.

FEMA will conduct outreach to assist occupants of temporary housing units with the documentation necessary to evaluate their ability to pay.

For more information on temporary housing, call the Individual Assistance Housing Hotline at 808-784-1600, contact 2-1-1 to reach the disaster case management program, or call FEMA Helpline at 800-621-3362 for assistance in other languages.

At 12:15 p.m. local time, a motorized rubber dinghy loaded with explosives detonated against the USS Cole, a U.S. Navy destroyer refueling in Aden, Yemen. The blast created a 40-by-40-foot hole in the ship's port side, resulting in the deaths of 17 sailors and injuries to 38 others. The attack was executed by two suicide bombers affiliated with al Qaeda, the terrorist network led by Osama bin Laden.

The USS Cole had stopped in Aden to refuel for only four hours, indicating that the attackers had precise and prior knowledge of its unannounced visit. The dinghy managed to blend in with other harbor vessels assisting the Cole during its mooring, allowing the terrorists to approach the warship without raising suspicion. As the dinghy reached the destroyer, it exploded, causing extensive damage to the engine room, mess area, and living quarters.

Witnesses aboard the Cole reported that both attackers stood up just before the explosion, indicating their intention to carry out the deadly mission. This incident marked one of the deadliest attacks against a U.S. naval vessel in recent history and highlighted vulnerabilities in maritime security at foreign ports, prompting significant changes in U.S. naval protocols and counterterrorism efforts in the region. The attack ultimately underscored the growing threat posed by al Qaeda and set the stage for increased tensions between the U.S. and extremist groups in the Middle East.",en,Tweet,0,23,8,3,2162.0,2024-10-12 12:50:24,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZsA79JWIAQRfQo.jpg

Like I said following Hurricane Helene, while I appreciate the president and FEMA Administrator coming to Florida to see the devastation firsthand, Floridians are still hurting from storms years ago, and the federal government needs to show up not just today but every day. Not only did storm surge cause significant issues on the coast, but first responders are still conducting non-stop rescue missions as rising rivers cause inland flooding and tornadoes ripped apart entire communities. This storm, along with Hurricane #Helene, has knocked so many communities down, but Floridians are resilient. Following Hurricane Helene, I told President Biden exactly what is needed to ensure Florida has every federal resource to fully recover from that storm and now Hurricane #Milton, I reiterated that in our call last week and again today. Here‚Äôs what I stressed to the President: I‚Äôm calling on Schumer to bring the Senate back ASAP when our communities have assessed their needs, which I told the president must be expedited, to pass needed disaster funding for FEMA, @SBAgov and the USDA and approve common sense relief like my Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act. The president told me he agreed with me on this last week. We must also ensure FEMA opens Disaster Recovery Centers close to the areas hit hardest, so those impacted have easy access to federal resources to recover. Finally, I again stressed to @POTUS the importance of @USDA immediately approving block grants for our farmers that have been struggling since Ian in 2022.¬†I discussed the same things during my calls on Thursday with @FEMA Administrator @FEMA_Deanne Criswell and SBA Administrator @SBAIsabel Casillas Guzman.

Esta tormenta, junto con el hurac√°n Helene, ha derribado a tantas comunidades, pero los floridanos son resilientes.

Esto es lo que le enfatic√© al presidente: Hago un llamado a Schumer para que el Senado vuelva lo antes posible cuando nuestras comunidades hayan evaluado sus necesidades, lo que le dije al presidente debe acelerarse, para aprobar los fondos necesarios para desastres para FEMA, SBA y el USDA y aprobar un alivio de sentido com√∫n como m√≠ Proyecto de ley Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act. El presidente me dijo que estaba de acuerdo conmigo en esto la semana pasada. Tambi√©n debemos asegurarnos de que FEMA abra Centros de Recuperaci√≥n de Desastres cerca de las √°reas m√°s afectadas, para que los afectados tengan f√°cil acceso a los recursos federales para recuperarse. Finalmente, volv√≠ a enfatizar al Presidente Biden la importancia de que el USDA apruebe de inmediato subvenciones en bloque para nuestros agricultores que han estado luchando desde Ian en 2022.

"Smith, Adam",Representative,Washington,9,Democratic,House: 1997-Present,Yes,RepAdamSmith,'1845649817315225988',"I am disappointed by Boeing‚Äôs decision to lay off 10 percent of its 170,000-employee workforce over the coming months. This is a hard day for Boeing employees across the world and many of whom reside in King County, Washington. My heart is with those employees and their families who will find themselves out of work.
¬†
Employees are being forced to absorb the consequences of poor corporate management and oversight. In recent years, the company has prioritized profits and stakeholders over the integrity of their product and the well-being of their employees. This strategy is clearly not working. From production delays, faulty parts, stranded astronauts, ongoing litigation, and investigations, Boeing has struggled to produce high quality products.
¬†
This failure has a rippling impact on the nation and the strength of American aerospace. Boeing is a giant legacy aerospace company and the way that they do business impacts not only folks in King County, but also people across the world. Our transportation sector and our national defense rely on the strength of Boeing, but any company is only as strong as its workforce.
¬†
Boeing‚Äôs success relies on its dedicated employees, and investing in them is essential for long-term recovery. Boeing employees have put up with a lot for a long time, from cut pensions to insufficient wage increases. Now more than ever, a fair resolution to the machinists‚Äô strike is essential to restore trust and show commitment to those who drive Boeing‚Äôs future.

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1845801358986785088',"On this day in 1982, President Ronald Reagan declared illicit drugs a significant threat to U.S. national security. 

The phrase ""war on drugs"" was initially popularized by Richard Nixon in 1971, but the origins of drug policy in the U.S. can be traced back to the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914 and the establishment of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in 1930, reflecting a long history of drug regulation.

In a speech at the Justice Department, Reagan likened his administration‚Äôs commitment to combating drug use and trafficking to the determination shown by the French army during the Battle of Verdun in World War I, stressing that challenges could be overcome with resolve. He quoted a French soldier, asserting, ‚ÄúThere are no impossible situations. There are only people who think they‚Äôre impossible.‚Äù

First Lady Nancy Reagan played a crucial role in spreading the anti-drug message, actively touring elementary schools to educate children about the dangers of drug use. During one visit, when a fourth grader at Longfellow Elementary School in Oakland, California, asked how to respond if offered drugs, she famously replied, ‚ÄúJust say no,‚Äù making the phrase a cultural touchstone.

In 1988, Reagan established the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to coordinate drug-related initiatives across various government sectors, including legislation, security, and health policy. The media dubbed its directors ‚Äúdrug czars,‚Äù reflecting the growing focus on a centralized approach to drug control. In 1993, President Bill Clinton elevated the position to Cabinet-level status, highlighting the ongoing commitment to addressing drug issues at the highest levels of government.

Reagan‚Äôs efforts marked a significant escalation in the War on Drugs, leading to increased funding for drug enforcement and harsher penalties for drug offenses, which contributed to a dramatic rise in incarceration rates for nonviolent drug crimes. This intensified focus on drug policy would have lasting implications for law enforcement and communities across the nation.",en,Tweet,1,25,7,33,9952.0,2024-10-14 13:18:31,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZ2ajYCXAAsDdHG.jpg

MI Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II, MN Attorney General Keith Ellison, NY Attorney General Tish James, And Congressman Jonathon L. Jackson Join Other Elected Officials, Workers, Employers, and Economic Justice Organizers from Around the Country to Celebrate Michigan‚Äôs Bold Step in Raising Wages and Ending Subminimum Wages
¬†
Media Planning to Attend In Person or Virtually is Kindly Asked to RSVP here
¬†
#Detroit, MI ‚ÄîAs the 2024 elections approach, one issue remains central to both the economy and the path to victory: wages. The rising cost of living has left millions of workers struggling to make ends meet, making jobs with living wages a top priority for working class voters across the country. Just two months ago, the Supreme Court in the battleground state of Michigan made history by ruling to raise wages for 1.2 million workers to $15 by 2028, while also ending the subminimum wage for workers with disabilities, youth and¬† tipped employees‚Äîan outdated and unjust practice that was created after Emancipation to allow restaurants to hire newly-freed Black workers for free. The ruling makes Michigan the first state East of the MIssissippi to end this legacy of slavery.
On October 15, 2024, from 10:00 - 11:00 AM EDT, @onefairwage in collaboration with People‚Äôs Action and @MichiganUnitedAction will bring together Lieutenant Governors, Attorney Generals, national civil rights leaders and representation from various labor and advocacy organizations for a celebration of #Michigan‚Äôs historic victory for workers, uplifting the significance of Michigan‚Äôs leadership on wage reform and the importance of wage equity in this year‚Äôs Presidential election. The event will highlight Michigan‚Äôs leadership role in economic justice, the growing momentum across the country, and how this victory will be a key issue in upcoming elections. The audience will have an opportunity to engage our leaders and engage in meaningful dialog.
WHO:
‚Ä¢Michigan Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II
‚Ä¢Minnesota Attorney General @keithellison Ellison
‚Ä¢Congressman Jonathon Jackson (IL-01)
‚Ä¢@PortiaRobeson , Chief Executive Officer, Focus of Hope¬†
‚Ä¢New York Attorney General @TishJames James (virtual)
‚Ä¢Additional labor leaders and workers who will speak about the direct impact of the wage increase and the end of subminimum wages.
¬†
**NOTE: Workers will be available to speak to the media on the importance of wages in their voting decisions in this year‚Äôs Presidential election. **
¬†
WHEN: October 15, 2024, 10:00 - 11:00 AM EDT¬†
WHERE: Please RSVP here. Location details will be provided upon RSVP.¬†
This event marks a pivotal moment in the fight for living wages, as Michigan‚Äôs Supreme Court ruling sets the stage for national wage reform efforts. With the elimination of the subminimum wage for tipped workers‚Äîa practice with roots in systemic inequality‚ÄîMichigan is leading the charge in ensuring fair compensation for all workers. This victory is expected to have broad implications for the labor movement and wage policies across the U.S., particularly as the issue of economic justice takes center stage in the upcoming election cycle. Journalists will have the opportunity to hear directly from elected officials and labor advocates about the next steps in the movement and how other states may follow Michigan‚Äôs lead.
In addition to remarks from the featured speakers, the event will include first hand stories from workers impacted by the wage increase, offering powerful perspectives on how these changes are improving lives and communities.¬†

Following the retirement of Thurgood Marshall in July 1991, President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas, a conservative African American judge. Despite initially facing little opposition, the hearings took a dramatic turn when he was accused of sexual harassment. The televised hearings revealed a stark divide, the testimony met by skepticism from the committee, and Thomas denied the allegations. 

Ultimately, the Senate confirmed Thomas, marking a significant shift toward conservatism in the Supreme Court. Known for his originalist interpretation of the Constitution, Thomas often emphasizes a strict adherence to the text and intent of the framers. He has consistently supported limited government, individual rights, and states' rights, often aligning with fellow conservatives on key issues.",en,Tweet,3,126,33,14,4102.0,2024-10-15 12:36:42,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZ7akXYX0AAu7LA.jpg

Mr. Young served as one of the members of the 'B' Company, 720th Military Police Battalion, Military Police Brigade.

Mr. Young was trained to be a Military Policeman (MP) but when he arrived in Vietnam, his unit became part of the Bushwhackers whose duties included heading into the jungle to interdict North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops. And since they were MPs, the Army would not issue them the Combat Infantry Badge. I was pleased to work with the veterans who made up 'B' Company to make sure they received the recognition they deserve - the Bronze Star.
