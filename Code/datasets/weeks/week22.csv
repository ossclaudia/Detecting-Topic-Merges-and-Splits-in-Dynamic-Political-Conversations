"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1892556802388082779',"MAGA NATION, this post is for you, please read.

I know you because I’m one of you and we delivered a mandate which is President Trump’s America First agenda - the agenda he campaigned on at every rally he held and we attended across the country. 

Congress has to deliver that mandate with our budget reconciliation process, but some in Congress are developing amnesia to the very fact that YOU, the people, did not vote for them and their agenda, YOU voted for Trump and HIS agenda.

President Trump and his great team are delivering his campaign promises at record speed through his executive orders and DOGE.

President Trump is slashing regulations, destroying DEI, making the world respect America again through reciprocal tariffs, is in the process of ending world wars and America paying for them, has secured the border and begun deportations, is reducing the over bloated government workforce, and with Elon’s DOGE - they are literally exposing and dismantling the deep state’s government money laundering and out right fraud!  It’s been an AMAZING first month.

But we in Congress now have to deliver as well.

With the historic election. You would think Republicans would just whip up our bills, budget, and approps and pass them with ease, but nope, it’s so much harder than it should be.

President Trump wants one big beautiful bill and I prefer one as well, but we have to make sure HIS agenda is in that one big beautiful bill and there are a few items that some of my conservative colleagues don’t support. (Conservative doesn’t mean they supported Trump until they had to)

No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, and No Tax on Social Security were President Trump’s big campaign promises and some conservatives don’t want to include those when we renew the tax law - Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 

Those tax campaign promises help many Americans that need it the most as they have been hit hard by Biden and the Democrat’s high inflation over the past 4 years.  We are talking about senior’s and workers. 

So why, you ask, would some conservatives not support no tax on tips, overtime, and social security???

It’s because they are singularly focused on deeply cutting spending and some of them never supported Trump in the first place so they have no respect for the people’s mandate. Some of them simply don’t get it. And some of them think overly highly of themselves and their own plan.

Here is what they are missing, as well as some others in our Republican conference. 

With spending cuts, DOGE cuts, Trump’s de-regs, Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, energy policies, we MUST renew TCJA WITH all of the no tax campaign promises because ALL OF THIS together will be like Elon’s rockets to our economy!!!

And it all will work together to drive revenue AND cut spending AND will deliver the mandate THE PEOPLE voted for!!!

Cutting spending is only one piece and believe me I’m all for it, but with our compounding interest now bigger than our military budget, we can’t cut our way out of this.

We have to increase revenue but not be so blind and stupid that we give tax breaks to corporations but NOT to desperately suffering workers and seniors!!!

Give money back to workers and seniors and they will spend it into the economy and will be thanking Republicans at the same time!!!

Increasing revenue will happen through reciprocal tariffs, killing the green new deal handouts and tax breaks and driving American energy (which will lower business cost and inflation), cutting the strangling regulations on businesses, and DOGE’s lethal attack on the deep state’s money laundering and fraud.

But for the love of God, help the people that need it most, get out of your own way, deliver TRUMP’S agenda, and maybe just maybe we will win the midterms if we do this right.",en,Tweet,300,14193,3978,2101,278357.0,2025-02-20 12:47:58,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Every hostage must be brought home. Every innocent life must be honored. And every terrorist must face the full weight of justice.

I am pleased that — after too much delay — the Senate has confirmed Kash Patel today as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Americans across the country have lost faith in the bureau's ability to fulfill its mission to the American people and the Constitution. Instead of targeting real criminals and public safety threats, FBI leadership has been focused for too long on politicized witch hunts ranging from President Trump and his team to concerned parents like my friend Scott Smith and pro-life Americans like Mark Houck.

As a former federal prosecutor and First Assistant Attorney General of Texas, it’s important to me that Director Patel has made clear his mission to serve as the disruptor America needs at the FBI.  He is poised to end the corruption, politicization, and weaponization that have taken the FBI away from its designated mission — much of which has exploded in the post 9/11 drift toward loose definitions of domestic terrorism that have moved the department off the path of combatting organized crime across state lines.

"Murkowski, Lisa",Senator,Alaska,,Republican,Senate: 2002-Present,Yes,lisamurkowski,'1892664719321735274',"I will oppose Kash Patel’s confirmation to serve as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI’s mission is “to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States.” Mr. Patel and I agree the bureau has crept past that mission, become an increasingly political agency, and eroded the public’s trust. We have had multiple frank and open discussions about how best to restore that trust. I agree with Mr. Patel that it begins by getting agents out in the field, doing what they signed up to do, rather than sitting behind an administrative desk.

My reservations with Mr. Patel stem from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership. The FBI must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores. I have been disappointed that when he had the opportunity to push back on the administration’s decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.

If confirmed, I wish him a successful tenure at the helm of this agency, and will endeavor to work with him to help address issues in Alaska, improve Tribal law enforcement across the country, and make needed changes within the FBI.

-Firing the USDA team responsible for stopping the spread of avian flu;
-Firing 6,700 IRS agents whose primary responsibility was chasing down rich tax cheats;
-Freezing the hiring and onboarding of thousands of federal firefighters;
-Confirming Kash Patel — who is dangerous, dishonest, and unqualified, to say the least — to lead the FBI after he promised to get revenge on the President's ""enemies"";
-Weaponizing the Department of Justice, as promised, to seek revenge against critics; in this case, opening a DOJ investigation against Congressman Robert Garcia for comments he made that were critical of Elon Musk;
-The ongoing silence from Republicans who know what the Administration is doing is wrong but won't say it.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1892985999372014053',"Each week, we share remarkable stories from across our district—stories of people who rise above the ordinary and remind us of the power of kindness, connection, and community. This week, we honor a man who has spent a lifetime doing just that. A man who needs no introduction but certainly deserves our recognition. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: Doug Turner.
 
At 87 years old, Doug Turner has spent his life in service—to his country as a U.S. Army veteran, to our land as a 30-year U.S. Forest Service worker, and to our community as an artist, a storyteller, and a neighbor in the truest sense of the word. Along with his late wife Susan—who served as Newtown Borough Council President—Doug dedicated himself to the town they called home, whether teaching students at Goodnoe Elementary about the importance of trees or helping organize Newtown’s annual Arbor Day celebration. 
 
In 2022, when Doug lost Susan, he found a way to keep their shared spirit of giving alive—by bringing people together. He started hosting an annual winter party, a simple gathering meant to combat the isolation of winter and rekindle the warmth of true neighborly connection. No guest list, no expectations. Just an open door and one request: “Bring only a smile.”
 
This year, however, something remarkable happened. A simple act—an old-fashioned, handwritten, hand-delivered invitation—didn’t just bring together a neighborhood; it brought together the world. Doug's invitation scribbled on a paper snowflake with his signature humor, ""From 4 p.m. to whenever the cops come,” captured hearts from Alaska to Australia. Inspired by Doug, people everywhere started throwing their own neighborhood parties, making a conscious effort to reach out to those around them. What Doug started in his corner of Newtown rippled throughout the world, proving that one person can ignite a movement of kindness—one, in this case, that went viral.
 
So today, we celebrate Doug—not for a viral party, but for showing us that in a world often divided, there is still more that unites us than separates us.

"Hirono, Mazie K.",Senator,Hawaii,,Democratic,"Senate: 2013-Present, House: 2007-2013",Yes,maziehirono,'1893411307153436848',"President Trump’s decision to fire General CQ Brown, Admiral Lisa Franchetti, General James Slife, and the senior uniformed attorneys of the Army, Navy, and Air Force is an incredibly reckless decision that dangerously politicizes our military and undermines our national security, military readiness, and the rule of law, ultimately making Americans less safe. 

These senior leaders have faithfully and apolitically served our country for decades, providing exactly what the Constitution expects of them - their best military advice to civilian leadership. There is no reasonable justification for these terminations. Instead, the dismissals reveal the President’s true intention - installing a group of “yes men” with fealty to him and not the Constitution or the American people. It’s also revealing that General Brown and Admiral Franchetti, both fired, are the only person of color and woman, respectively, serving on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

The firings of each of the Services’ senior uniformed legal advisors is particularly troubling and completely unprecedented. These nonpartisan attorneys serve continuously in both Republican and Democratic administrations, without fear or favor. Our military leaders rely on them to provide their best legal advice, regardless of party.  It’s clear these individuals were singled out to ensure their successors understood that only the President’s expansive and legally dubious interpretations of military law would be tolerated. Ultimately, these dismissals will have a chilling effect on the willingness of uniformed attorneys to speak truth to power, undermining the rule of law.

At a time of global uncertainty, we need steady, experienced leadership at the highest levels of our military.  While President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have claimed repeatedly they want the military to focus solely on “lethality,” firing senior leaders willing to push back and installing “yes men” in their place will have the opposite effect. My Republican colleagues say they care about the military and are willing to spend billions more to increase lethality, but shamefully put their heads in the sand as the President threatens the foundation of our military and our democracy with these unprecedented firings. Now is the time for all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to prove they really care about the military by pushing back against this brazenly political attack.

Preserving the integrity of our armed forces is not a partisan issue. Every Member of Congress took an oath to support the Constitution and that oath compels each of us to push back against the President’s dangerous attempt to politicize our military.",en,Tweet,6,322,114,86,9837.0,2025-02-22 21:23:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Yet, instead of providing them with the resources they need, this administration’s budget freezes and hiring cuts are putting lives, homes, and ecosystems at greater risk.

Prescribed burns reduce fuel for wildfires, but essential projects are being canceled due to frozen funds. The impact? More destructive fires, more devastation, and more danger for our firefighters and communities.

I’ve fought to ensure our federal firefighting force gets the pay, staffing, and resources it needs, including through funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act. I’m continuing to work on bipartisan legislation to modernize our approach to wildfire prevention in the wildland urban interface and beyond. But those funds are now being blocked, leaving our first responders in limbo. We must support our wildland firefighters.

Interesting FACT: roughly 85% of spending is not ever even looked at by Congress - convenient if you would like to hide waste, fraud and abuse.

I appreciate @chiproytx and @RepArrington for their efforts to move savings from 150B to maybe 200B per year, but even if we take out the 460B increase in social security spending since 2019, even if we adjust the budget for high inflation caused by this outrageous spending (roughly 23% in 5 years), and additional Medicare enrollment of 5M seniors since 2019 adjusted for inflation, we are still about 1.2T per year short = 7T (2024) - ADJ 5.8T (4.5T (2019 spending) + 0.46T (increase in social security) + 0.78T (inflation adjustment for non-social security spending) + 0.08T increase in the number of Medicare recipients adjusted for inflation). If we only search for up to 0.2T, we still have $1 TRILLION per year unexplained. I have a responsibility to the people I represent to find $1T of their hard earned money! 

Some interesting observations: 

1) Federal spending per each Medicare recipient almost doubled in 5 years (about 80% increase per person or additional 500B PER YEAR)! I do not hear from the seniors in my district that quality of it doubled - on the contrary - many complaints about Medicare Advantage, reduction in physician’s fees and dishonest billing by large hospitals; and 

2) Federal spending per each Medicaid recipient increased more than 60% since the ACA expansion in 2014 (or over 100B per year adjusted for inflation). I also do not hear in my district that the quality of Medicaid significantly increased. On the contrary, people with disabilities,  Medicaid was originally intended for, get less and less services.

Meanwhile, at that time our border was being invaded every single day by thousands of people from all over the world and hundreds were being murdered daily by cartel trafficked fentanyl and I was constantly fighting that our money and government should be defending and securing our border.

🇺🇸 Three years ago today, Vladimir Putin illegally invaded Ukraine without justification and without provocation.  

🇺🇸 The United States of America stands for the Rule of Law, and respects and defends the borders and territorial sovereignty of all Freedom-Loving Nations.  

🇺🇸 Ukraine is an independent, sovereign, and freedom-loving nation, and is an ally of the United States of America and the Free World.  

🇺🇸 Vladimir Putin, through his illegal invasions, genocide, kidnapping, rape, torture and murder of innocent civilians, including women and children, is an enemy of the United States of America and the Free World.  

🇺🇸 The United States of America stands with Democracies and opposes Dictatorships.

🇺🇸 Volodymyr Zelenskyy is the Legitimately Elected President of Ukraine through a free and fair election.  

🇺🇸 Vladimir Putin is an Unelected Dictator who imprisons his political opponents and who has never held a free and fair election.  

🇺🇸 The Ukrainian election has been delayed because Ukraine is under daily relentlessly bombings, over 200 per day, by Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine is in a State of 24/7 Martial Law.  

🇺🇸 Ukraine will hold their elections as soon as Vladimir Putin stops his unprovoked, unjustified daily bombings inside Ukraine. 

🇺🇸 If Putin is rewarded for his illegal invasion and genocide, this will serve as a green-light incentive to other Dictators, such as CCP Chairman Xi Jinping, to pursue their own conquests (i.e. Taiwan), which will lead to more instability across the Globe. 

🇺🇸 Dictators like Vladimir Putin are the Adult Versions of the School Yard Bullies that we all confronted in Grade School. And they must be dealt with in the same exact way. There is Peace through Strength, and there is War through Weakness. There is no magical third option.

He alone is responsible for the devastation that has been wrought over these past three years.                                   

As Ukraine has sought to defend itself and its people, we have rightly supported them. They have fought valiantly in defense of freedom and Democracy — ideals Vladimir Putin would never support.

However, this war must come to an end, and a settlement be negotiated that ensures Ukraine’s sovereignty and lasting peace in the region. In the absence of that, I am concerned about the path forward. If Ukraine falls it will have devastating consequences for Europe, the United States, and the free world.

As negotiations commence, we must be clear-eyed and hold Putin and Russia accountable for their conduct. We must ensure Putin and Russia are removed from Ukraine. And we must ensure stronger economic and national security ties between the United States, and Ukraine as the rebuilding process begins.

Since then, I have been working closely with the @PennsylvaniaDEP, @PHMSA_DOT, @SecDuffy, and local officials to demand answers, accountability, and immediate action.

While PHMSA and the Department of Transportation have been engaged, our community still lacks full transparency and certainty. Families should not have to wonder whether their water is safe, and no pipeline should continue operating when fundamental safety concerns remain unresolved.

That is why today, alongside @SenFettermanPA, I am calling on PHMSA Acting Administrator Ben Kochman to keep the pipeline fully offline until a comprehensive investigation is complete, every corrective measure is implemented, and it is definitively proven no further risks remain.

Public safety is not a question of convenience—it is a responsibility.

Make no mistake: This unholy alliance formed by our adversaries seeks to undermine western values, weaken U.S. national security, and upend the global balance of power.

I agree with President Trump that this would never have happened had he been in office. There’s a reason these hostile regimes did not attack sovereign territories during his first term: He projected peace through strength. All the pain and bloodshed in Europe could have been prevented if Democrats — under both the Obama and Biden administrations — had stood up to Putin sooner.

This war has raged for three years too many. Putin could stop the killing today, but since he refuses — President Trump has answered the call to help put an end to the fighting.

"Massie, Thomas",Representative,Kentucky,4,Republican,House: 2012-Present,Yes,RepThomasMassie,'1894360938314100769',"I asked Grok if ethanol subsidies and mandates increase food prices. Here’s Grok’s answer:

Ethanol mandates and subsidies can indeed push up food prices, and here’s how it plays out. In the U.S., the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires blending ethanol—mostly made from corn—into gasoline. Subsidies, like tax credits or direct payments to producers, sweeten the deal for ethanol makers. This jacks up demand for corn, a staple crop for both fuel and food. When more corn gets diverted to ethanol refineries, less is left for livestock feed, processed foods, or export markets. Basic supply and demand kicks in: reduced corn supply for food purposes means higher prices for corn-based products.

Look at the numbers. In 2022, about 40% of U.S. corn production—roughly 5.3 billion bushels—went to ethanol, according to the USDA. That’s a massive chunk of a crop that also feeds cattle, pigs, and chickens. When corn prices rise—say, from $3 a bushel to $7, like they did between 2020 and 2022—feed costs for livestock climb too. That ripples through to higher prices for beef, pork, eggs, and dairy at the grocery store. A 2011 National Academy of Sciences study pegged the RFS as bumping corn prices by 20-40% in tight supply years. More recent analyses, like from Iowa State’s CARD in 2023, suggest ethanol policies still add about 10-15% to corn prices annually, depending on harvest yields and global demand.

It’s not just corn, either. Land that could grow wheat, soy, or other crops gets planted with corn instead because ethanol keeps corn profitable—subsidies have historically pushed corn’s return per acre above other grains. The USDA says cropland devoted to corn hit 92 million acres in 2023, crowding out alternatives. Less wheat or soy means tighter supplies and higher prices for bread, cooking oil, and tofu too.

On the flip side, ethanol backers argue it’s not the mandates alone—global factors like weather, oil prices, and trade wars mess with food costs too. They’re not wrong; the 2022 Ukraine invasion spiked grain prices worldwide, ethanol or not. Plus, ethanol coproducts like distillers’ grains get fed back to livestock, offsetting some feed cost hikes. A 2021 Renewable Fuels Association report claimed this keeps the food price impact under 5%. But that’s a tough sell when corn prices drive so much of the ag economy—USDA data shows a $1 increase in corn per bushel adds about $0.40 to a pound of retail beef over time.

Globally, it’s messier. In poorer countries, where people spend 30-50% of income on food (vs. 10% in the U.S.), ethanol-driven grain price jumps hit harder. The 2007-2008 food crisis partly blamed U.S. ethanol policies for spiking corn and tortilla prices in Mexico—FAO estimated a 10-15% food price bump there tied to biofuels.

So, yeah, ethanol mandates and subsidies generally nudge food prices up—how much depends on harvests, markets, and policy tweaks. Without them, corn might stay cheaper, but gas prices could climb unless oil steps in. It’s a trade-off: fuel security vs. food affordability. What’s your take on balancing those?",en,Reply,169,3318,607,368,255127.0,2025-02-25 12:16:57,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

"Massie, Thomas",Representative,Kentucky,4,Republican,House: 2012-Present,Yes,RepThomasMassie,'1894383653553127758',"When I was County Judge Executive in Lewis County Kentucky, I was responsible for signing the check that paid for every phone landline and cellphone billed to the county.

At first it seemed impossible to ferret out the waste, fraud, and abuse for these phone plans.

How many phones were taxpayers paying for that were defunct? How many were former county employees who were no longer employed but had been able to keep their phone and mooch off the taxpayer? Was any of it fraudulent or inaccurate billing by the service provider?

But then I came up with an idea… I told every county department (Sheriff, Clerk, Road Crew, Jail, etc.) to give me a list of their phones matched to their county employees or offices.

In one month, I would DEACTIVATE EVERY PHONE that wasn’t on one of these lists.

A month went by and only about 80% complied with the directive to list their phones. I gave them one more month and issued a serious warning that their phones would be turned off at the end of the next month.

Finally, I directed the phone company to deactivate all phones that weren’t accounted for. Guess what?

The jailer called me up and said the finger print machine wouldn’t send finger prints to the state police anymore. Ha! That was the only legitimate phone line that I deactivated. We quickly got it reactivated.

I ended up saving our county thousands of dollars on the phone bill, much to the chagrin of the phone company and a few moochers who no longer had free phone plans. I think most of the savings came from phones that just weren’t in service but had been left on the bill.

Why do I tell this story? Because what Elon is doing by asking federal employees to list five things they did in a week is brilliant. Requiring any kind of an affirmative response from a worker will prove whether that worker even exists and can be reached. Don’t forget, the Inspector General for Afghanistan found out we were paying millions for soldiers and police in Afghanistan who didn’t even exist (ghost employees). There’s no telling what Elon’s plan will uncover. We will find some employees can’t use email or aren’t even literate enough to write five things.

They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.""

Each of the judges with impeachment articles drafted against them has violated the public's trust by overtly targeting President Trump and his administration. Their rulings are intended to be politically undermining and nothing else.

As Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Congressional Pre-K & Child Care Caucus, I’ve worked closely with Valerie on addressing these critical issues in our PA-1 community, and her insights have been invaluable. Families in our community and across the nation are struggling, spending nearly  24% of their income on child care. 

That is why, last week, I introduced the Affordable Child Care Act—bipartisan legislation that doubles three key tax credits, puts money back in parents’ pockets, supports our early childhood educators and child care providers , and ensures every family has access to quality, affordable care.

No parent should be forced to choose between paying the bills and securing their child’s future. And no early learning or child care provider should struggle to keep their doors open.

A huge thank you to Valerie and all early childhood educators in PA-1 and across the nation for your selfless and important work shaping the next generation.

3️⃣ I stood on-site at @SLDelta30 in California as the Minuteman III ICBM launched. Seeing our strategic deterrent in action was a powerful reminder of what keeps America safe.

4️⃣ I voted to pass the Assisting Small Businesses Not Fraudsters Act because taxpayer dollars should go to real small businesses, not convicted fraudsters.

5️⃣ I joined @CherylCasone on @MorningsMaria to talk about Hamas' latest hostage release, the fragile ceasefire talks, and why strong American leadership is non-negotiable.
