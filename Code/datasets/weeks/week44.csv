"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1948400163875152237',"I have many concerns about the AI Executive Order signed yesterday by President Trump.

While I understand the many promised benefits of AI, I remain committed to protecting state rights, human jobs, human lives, human rights, our environment and critical water supply.

My deep concerns are that the EO demands rapid AI expansion with little to no guardrails and breaks. It also contains the threat of withholding federal funds from states who regulate AI, which is an absolute threat to federalism and why I strongly opposed the AI state moratorium originally in the BBB.

Rushed AI expansion and data centers being built all over the country from state to state with no plan in regards to environmental and critical water supply impact has massive future implications and problems. 

I‚Äôve been in construction my entire life.

I can tell you firsthand, when you move dirt there is always an impact to the surrounding area.

When you build something that requires a HIGH water demand, it will always take water away from others - that means people, cities, businesses, and surrounding counties and states. 

Data centers are like a black holes when it comes to water requirements. They consume massive amounts of water for cooling, literally millions of gallons per day. 

If you know anything about the water wars between GA,  TN, AL, and FLA, then you know states already fight each other over water supply. Counties fight each other over water supply and sue each other over PFAS/PFOS and other impacts. 

Just wait and see how bad lawsuits will become when counties are competing for data centers, in order to get rid of county property taxes, and the unintended results is new data centers that steal the water from surrounding homes and neighboring counties and states. 

Competing with China does not mean become like China by threatening state rights, replacing human jobs on mass scale creating mass poverty, and creating potentially devastating effects on our environment and critical water supply.

This needs a careful and wise approach. The AI EO takes the opposite.",en,Tweet,297,5192,1220,878,198962.0,2025-07-24 16:09:33,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Today, we shine a light on two such individuals‚Äîmeet this week's Hometown Heroes, Kevin Travers, a special education teacher at @BristolTwpSD, and @BristolTwpPD Officer Tyler Aspell.
 
Over 20 years ago, Kevin started Drummers With Attitude with little more than a few buckets, some sticks, and an idea: to create a space where every student feels like they belong. For Kevin, drumming had been a lifeline throughout his childhood‚Äîa way to cope, to focus, and to heal. He knew just how powerful that could be, and that his students could benefit from that same outlet.
 
Since then, Drummers With Attitude has become a home for students of all abilities and backgrounds‚Äîthose with disabilities, facing behavioral challenges, athletes, performers, and everyone in between. Different stories, one beat. They learn together, perform together, and take care of each other like family.
 
One of the early members of that family was Tyler Aspell.
 
Tyler grew up in Bristol Township and joined DWA as a student at Truman High School. The program gave him a sense of belonging and confidence that carried into a life of service. He joined the U.S. Army National Guard, became a Philadelphia police officer, and now serves as a Bristol Township Police Officer.
 
Recently, with his nephew now in the program, Officer Aspell returned to perform with the group, back where it all began. For the students in DWA, he wasn‚Äôt just a police officer‚Äîhe was one of them. A familiar face, a hometown success story, and a reminder of everything they‚Äôre capable of becoming.
 
That‚Äôs the legacy Kevin has built‚Äîone that doesn‚Äôt just create percussionists but builds leaders and brighter futures.
 
In 2023, I had the honor of inviting Drummers With Attitude to perform in our nation‚Äôs capital. Watching those students from our community take the stage in Washington, D.C, was an incredibly powerful moment.
 
To Kevin, thank you for creating something so extraordinary, for building a space where our students feel valued, capable, and inspired to follow their rhythm and believe in their potential. And to Officer Aspel, thank you for your service to both country and community, and for being a role model to the next generation.

Additionally, the United Nations and other international aid organizations must work with Israel to resolve their differences and work together so all parties can maximize the capacity of humanitarian efforts.

It is unconscionable that Hamas continues to block a negotiated ceasefire, refusing both to surrender their illegitimate power in Gaza and to release the hostages that should never have been taken in the first place. It is also unconscionable that Hamas siphons off critically needed food and supplies intended for the people of Gaza and uses it instead to prop up their terrorist organization, while at the same time fighting their war against Israel by embedding themselves into the civilian population.

But given all of this, right now it falls to Israel to take the steps necessary to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe facing the civilian population in Gaza. I urge President Trump and his administration to work with Israel to implement a ceasefire and dramatically increase the flow of aid into Gaza.

A resident of Lake Orion, Michigan, Sgt. Loughran enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after he graduated from high school at just 17 years old.¬†

After graduating from basic training as a Private First Class, Sgt. Loughran was recruited to join the Communication Intelligence Group as a Japanese Code Interpreter in the Pacific Theater during World War II.¬†

Over his three years of service with the Marine Corps from 1943 to 1946, Sgt. Loughran served on the battlefields of Tinian, Saipan, Guam, and Okinawa. He played a critical role in the Wind Talkers Initiative and the radio deception efforts that led to the pivotal American victory at the Battle of Midway.

After retiring from the Marine Corps, Sgt. Loughran earned an engineering degree and founded a successful business, Data Electronics, that expanded across five states. In his civilian life, Sgt. Loughran continued to serve his community. He helped revitalize a makeup studio and became an active volunteer with Toys for Tots and local Marine Corps veterans' groups.¬†

Today, Sgt. Loughran is not only a community leader and cherished World War II veteran, but he recently celebrated his 100th birthday surrounded by five generations of loved ones.¬†

We owe our deepest gratitude to the first responders who acted swiftly and selflessly to prevent an even greater loss of life.

This mass shooting is a devastating reminder that the epidemic of gun violence continues to plague our nation. The fact that a gunman crossed the country to carry out mass murder, despite a documented history of mental health crises, should alarm every one of us.

We cannot accept this as normal. We must confront the dangerous intersection of mental illness and easy access to deadly weapons. We are long overdue for stronger gun laws at the federal level and Congress has a responsibility to act.

New Yorkers are resilient, but they deserve more than thoughts and prayers. They deserve solutions.
