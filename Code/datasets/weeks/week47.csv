That is quite a statement and is an acknowledgment that nuclear armed Israel is more than capable of defending themselves, by themselves, and not only defeating their enemies, but completely wiping them out!

So why is America funding them and fighting for them??!!!

We should not be!! 

And it is not a matter of supporting either Israel or Hamas, as he suggest, which is ridiculous.  

It is about supporting AMERICA!!!

Lindsey Graham has no children.

I have 3 adult children, who are 22, 25, and 27, which gives me a fierce invested interest to be ALL IN to save America.

And we are now a nation in $37 TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT because of the NON-STOP votes and funding for foreign countries and foreign wars and bloated budgets and pork and waste for over 30 years, which is how long Lindsey Graham has been serving in Washington DC.

And the gross negligent consequences of America LAST decisions by MOST politicians in Washington DC has not only chained all of us and our future generations in debt, but eroded the value of our dollar, driven out of control inflation making life completely unaffordable, and is destroying the middle class and turning my children‚Äôs generation into the WORKING POOR!!!

WHICH PISSES ME OFF!!!

The sirens should be blaring in Washington DC with an all hands on deck panic mentality that every single elected member of congress and senator should be working as hard as possible to prevent our inevitable demise.

But instead, even after the America First mandate was delivered in the election of 2024, tone deaf Politicians in the swamp still slither up to podiums to deliver speeches that sound like the same Bush era propaganda that has led to 22 veteran suicides a day, every day, from devastating PTSD brought home from pointless foreign wars.

I am also completely amazed that Israel and their aligned groups like AIPAC (who is breaking the law by not registering under FARA) takes Members of Congress, and Conservative social media influencers (like TPUSA) on all expenses paid trips to Israel, and welcomes a steady stream of conservative media outlets in order to keep the funding stream going.

Can you imagine if Russia did this???

All hell broke loose when Tucker Carlson dared to show clean subways and well stocked grocery stores in Moscow!

We can support our allies, but our elected officials should not be funded or going on funded trips for the interest of foreign countries.

And God will not pull the plug on us, if we stop funding the secular government of Israel.

This is 1,000% false and is the fear mongering tactic used on good hearted American Christians to force us to fund and fight the secular government of nuclear armed Israel‚Äôs wars.

We don‚Äôt believe we go to heaven based on how much money we blindly give and how many bombs we drop on the secular government of Israel‚Äôs enemies.

Jesus said, ‚ÄúI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.‚Äù John 14:6

Jesus was extremely clear about how we should treat others, especially children.

Funding and blindly supporting an ally who is starving children is not going to bring God‚Äôs favor on America, as a matter of fact, I‚Äôll argue it will instead bring God‚Äôs wrath.

America‚Äôs intervention should be to stop the war and work for peace and demand the release of the poor Oct 7th hostages, while equally demanding to stop the genocide and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Lastly, American‚Äôs hard earned tax dollars should go to AMERICA ONLY!!!

3. Every negotiation isn‚Äôt about the financial bottom line. There are larger issues here that aren‚Äôt just about making a buck, issues that matter to keeping Americans safe. I‚Äôm not sure if the President sees that, but I hope the people around him do.¬†

Today, we shine a light on a remarkable woman whose leadership and service have shaped the very backbone of our local economy. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero, Susan Harkins of Levittown.
 
Yesterday, we had the honor of celebrating Susan‚Äôs 45 years of service with the @LowerBksChamber‚Äîa milestone that reflects not only remarkable longevity, but a legacy of true and lasting impact. For nearly half a century, Susan has been a driving force behind the Chamber‚Äôs mission‚Äîchampioning our businesses, empowering professionals, and creating opportunities that have strengthened the very foundation of our community.
 
The @USChamber of Commerce is more than an organization‚Äîit is the backbone of our local economy, where businesses come together to share ideas, build connections, and grow. For 45 years, Susan Harkins has been the heart of that mission, from her early days supporting Chamber committees to her leadership today as Professional Development Specialist. As a longtime partner of our local Chambers, I know firsthand how critical this work is to creating opportunity, and I‚Äôve been proud to collaborate on initiatives that bring new investment, strengthen workforce development, and ensure small businesses have the tools to thrive. At every step, leaders like Susan make that progress possible.
 
Her work with Leadership Bucks County, now in its 29th year, has cultivated a generation of civic and business leaders who continue to shape our region. Through programs like the Keynote Morning Meeting, Business Card Exchange, and Young Professionals Summits, Susan has created the networks, the mentorship, and the opportunities that drive careers forward and strengthen our business community as a whole.

Her impact cannot be measured by job titles or events alone‚Äîit is reflected in every professional she mentored, every student she supported, every small business she helped connect, and every leader she inspired to step forward. Simply put, the progress and prosperity of Lower Bucks County would not be what it is today without Susan.
 
Beyond the Chamber, she has carried that same spirit of service into her work with the A. Marlyn Moyer, Jr. Scholarship Foundation and the Bucks County Technical High School Foundation for Education Excellence‚Äîinvesting in the success of students and ensuring opportunity for the next generation.
 
Susan has been a builder of leaders, a champion of business, and a trusted guide for thousands who have walked through the Chamber‚Äôs doors.

"Sullivan, Dan",Senator,Alaska,,Republican,Senate: 2015-Present,Yes,SenDanSullivan,'1956902826602578358',"This year, Juneau has experienced a record level of flooding from the annual glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) down the Mendenhall River‚Äîover 16.5 feet‚Äîtopping last year‚Äôs record of 15.99 feet. In light of these serious challenges and the threat to the lives and property of Alaskans, I have been very focused on getting federal dollars and a workable enduring plan from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to fix this annual challenge in one of our biggest cities. Like I did in the aftermath of last year‚Äôs Juneau flood, I wanted to assess the damage as soon as possible this summer and begin the important work on a durable engineering solution to this problem, which is why I spent all day in Juneau today.
¬†
This morning, I took a helicopter tour of Mendenhall Glacier and the flood zone. I then participated in a very detailed briefing and roundtable discussion with the Unified Command team, including the City and Borough of Juneau, the Central Council of the Tlingit-Haida, the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Coast Guard, the Forest Service, the National Weather Service, and the State of Alaska. I want to commend everyone in the community for their incredible coordination, which no doubt saved lives.
¬†
Regarding next steps, the Corps is a critical partner in both the short-term and in the long-term, enduring solution. That is why, at my request, the recently confirmed Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Adam Telle, sent his top leadership for the Pacific Ocean Division‚ÄîBrigadier General Goetz‚Äîto be on the ground immediately to see the situation for himself. Earlier this year, Assistant Secretary Telle committed to me to expedite a solution for Juneau‚Äînot simply accepting another 10 years of studies. The HESCO barriers that were donated by the Corps have overall proven to be a ‚Äúwild success,‚Äù according to the city and the Corps, saving an estimated 1,000 homes from being flooded‚Äîbut they didn‚Äôt work perfectly.¬†
¬†
I truly want to commend USACE Brigadier General Goetz and Command Sergeant Major Zachary Plummer for their outstanding work, and all the time they have spent in the last week on the ground in Juneau, providing reassurance to the citizens of our capital city. I also want to thank Assistant Secretary Telle for already keeping his commitment to me that he would focus his senior team‚Äôs efforts on helping Juneau. 
¬†
I look forward to continue working with all of the stakeholders in Juneau and the Corps to expedite a long-term solution for this community, leveraging the important provisions in President Trump‚Äôs Day One executive order, Unleashing Alaska‚Äôs Extraordinary Resource Potential, which gives the Corps extraordinary powers to work on important Alaska projects, like this one.",en,Tweet,0,11,2,10,1828.0,2025-08-17 03:16:06,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1956897850966626304/vid/avc1/1280x720/LdBOePDWKF5SW8xa.mp4?tag=21

"Riley, Josh",Representative,New York,19,Democratic,House: 2025-Present,Yes,RepRileyNY,'1957083812199821329',"Last weekend, I visited Israel, including the West Bank and the Gaza border, to see the situation for myself and to speak directly with leaders there, including the head of the UN World Food Program, Palestinian Prime Minister Muhammad Mustafa, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, and senior intelligence officials. The history and politics of the region are complicated, but a few things are clear to me: 

First, there is a severe and undeniable humanitarian crisis in Gaza. More food is now entering Gaza, but it still is not getting to those who need it most. I am demanding that the UN and Israeli government jointly develop an aggressive operation to surge aid to innocent civilians. I pressed President Herzog on this issue, making clear that it is both a moral and a strategic imperative. 

Second, there can be no lasting peace for either Israelis or Palestinians so long as Iran continues to arm and finance terrorist proxies like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. Hamas is inflicting unimaginable suffering in the region‚Äìtorturing hostages, depriving innocent Gazans of basic needs, terrorizing Israelis, and unnecessarily prolonging the war that it started on October 7. Hamas needs to release the hostages, surrender its arms, and cede control to leaders who put the Palestinian people ahead of the Iranian regime.  

Third, I appreciate that so many of you feel so passionately about the war.  As a dad to two little kids, it‚Äôs heartbreaking to see images from this war where so many children‚ÄìIsraeli and Palestinian‚Äìare caught in the middle. As Upstate New Yorkers, I hope we can give each other the benefit of the doubt and start from our shared values, knowing that we all want the suffering to end and none of us supports violence against anyone because of how they worship.

¬†
I vehemently opposed this federal land grab for several reasons:

First, I believe in private property rights. The federal government should not take over vast swaths of land in the name of radical environmental initiatives like Biden‚Äôs 30x30 Plan and the Green New Deal.  

Second, the claim that the expansion was necessary to protect endangered species is simply not true, as the populations of the animals listed under this plan are thriving.

Third, the federal government has failed to manage the land it already controls, as the maintenance backlog for the National Wildlife Refuge System is over $2.6 billion. If the government can‚Äôt manage the land it already owns, why in the world would we expect that it can handle more?

Fourth, the slashing of the local tax base would decimate schools, public safety, and important services in West Texas, as the federal government does not adequately reimburse communities for land purchases.

Fifth, this would enable more federal overreach similar to the Biden Administration‚Äôs weaponization of federal agencies against farmers, independent energy producers, and the State of Texas‚Äôs efforts to secure the border.

And, finally, at a time when our nation‚Äôs debt has surpassed WWII levels, the federal government has no business spending your tax dollars to expand federal land.",en,Tweet,0,10,2,2,1029.0,2025-08-19 21:11:15,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GyvaAatWEAA35o8.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GyvaAapXIAAbzt4.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GyvaAa0XMAAMMbZ.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GyvaAazWIAM8G6w.jpg"
