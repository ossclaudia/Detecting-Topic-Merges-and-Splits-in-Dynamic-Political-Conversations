Why? Because they want new parents, both mothers and fathers, in the House to be able to vote by proxy.

Folks, proxy voting is unconstitutional in all cases whatsoever; Congress has a constitutional mandate to assemble. 

Moreover, we’ve already seen how this unconstitutional practice can be abused. Under Speaker Pelosi’s reign, members in both parties took advantage of proxy voting while their constituents were subjected to draconian COVID policies.

The misguided action of these nine Republicans has delayed our ability to continue advancing President Trump’s commonsense policies to get our country back on track.

China, who steals our technology and was a third world country until America shipped its manufacturing there, charges tariffs on U.S. products at a whopping 67%, Trump only gave China 34%!

The European Union, who would all be speaking German today if we had not gotten involved in WWI & WWII, charges America 39%, Trump only gave them 20%!

Vietnam, where many Americans died after being drafted to war, charges America 90%, Trump only gave them 46%!

India charges America 52%, but Trump only gave them 26%! 

And it goes on and on. However most countries Pres Trump only imposed 10% tariffs.

Will there be an adjustment?
Yes.

"Massie, Thomas",Representative,Kentucky,4,Republican,House: 2012-Present,Yes,RepThomasMassie,'1907812413921005696',"In this episode of in-the-weeds, I’ll talk about how the Rules Committee, a.k.a. the Speaker’s committee, can circumvent House rules and even federal laws that govern House rules.

There are House rules and federal laws that allow rank and file members in specific circumstances to bring legislation to the floor without the Speaker’s approval. But the Speaker can use the rules committee to “turn off” these special procedures, if he can get a majority of members of the whole House to vote for the Rules Committee Resolution to disable these special procedures.

Let’s look at three methods for expediting legislation, that the Speaker can thwart if he can pass a tailored resolution on the floor from the Rules Committee.

1. Discharge Petition
If a member can get 218 colleagues to sign a discharge petition, legislation can be brought to the floor against the Speaker’s wishes. I’ve only seen this done a couple of times in the twelve years I’ve served in Congress. It’s rare because it’s considered an act of rebellion by majority members against the Speaker. It was once used to pass a bill reauthorizing the Import/Export Bank ostensibly without the approval of Speaker Boehner, but Boehner had announced his resignation and was a weak at the time.

This week, Rep Luna, in an act of defiance against Speaker Johnson, employed a discharge petition to expedite consideration of Democrat legislation to allow new mothers in Congress to vote remotely. She acquired the requisite 218 votes by enlisting all democrats and a few Republican colleagues.

The Rules Committee offered a resolution to “turn off” the House rule that enabled her discharge petition. The resolution also contained procedures for bringing popular Republican bills to the floor that dealt with election integrity and rogue judges. The Speaker gambled that Republicans wouldn’t vote against a resolution that enabled these popular bills. I voted FOR the Soeaker’s resolution to disable the discharge petition because I agree with the Speaker’s attempt to prevent what I consider to be unconstitutional legislation from coming to the floor, and (b) the resolution modified house rules, instead of thwarting the intent of standing federal law.

The Resolution from the Rules committee failed because nine republicans joined Rep Luna and all democrats in voting against the Rules Committee Resolution that would have disabled Luna’s discharge petition. They set up a game of chicken, and the cars crashed into each other.

Unless the Speaker has more tricks up his sleeve, next week we vote on the Democrat legislation to give a sort of maternity leave to members of Congress.

2. War Powers Act

The War Powers Act sets forth an expedited procedure for Congress to countermand the Executive branch when the Executive conducts acts of war without congressional authorization. According to FEDERAL LAW, any member can bring this resolution to the floor quickly. In the past, Speakers have successfully used a Rules Committee resolution (passed by the whole House) to stop a vote on the issue of war from coming to the House floor. How can federal law be thwarted by a House Resolution? The Rules Committee merely has to say in its resolution that the war powers resolution brought forth by the member doesn’t qualify as a war powers resolution (even if it clearly does!). When I served on the Rules Committee last Congress, I made it clear that I would not engage in this nonsense, and I did not.

3. National Emergencies Act
Members can force votes to countermand Executive declarations of National emergencies, such as the one underpinning Trump’s tariffs. This was tried a couple of weeks ago, but the Speaker thwarted federal law with a Rules Committee Resolution. I was the only Republican to vote against the Speaker’s resolution, so his measure carried and we had no vote on the national emergency that underpins Trump’s new tariffs.

“The Biden Administration’s open-border policies, led by impeached former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, brought a historic number of criminal aliens and dangerous actors into our communities.  Texans – including those in TX21 – have suffered as a direct result, from dozens of fentanyl related deaths to human trafficking, and now an enormous gang operation. The Venezuela-based prison gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) - among the worst groups that have infiltrated the nation - was operating right in the heart of suburban Austin in Hays County, Texas, where I call home.

I commend the Hays County Sheriff's Office, the San Antonio Police Department (SAPD), the Texas Department of Public Safety (TDPS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for apprehending these foreign gang members from our streets. The people of Texas' 21 Congressional district – and the nation – are safer thanks to the teamwork of these agencies.

While South American gangs engage in murder, extortion, human trafficking, and terrorism - activist judges and radical progressive Democrats continue to impede the President and Republican leaders from removing these criminals from the United States.

However, I remain deeply concerned about the future of critical services for students with disabilities, early childhood education programs, and civil rights protections for our most vulnerable children.

Congress created the Department of Education. We can and should have thorough policy debates about how to best deliver services and protections for children, but the President does not have the power to dismantle the Department.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Congresswoman Mary Miller (IL-15) introduced the Love Them Both Act. The legislation seeks to block the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights from interpreting the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to include coverage for abortions or related services.  

""The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was meant to support new mothers and their children—not fund the destruction of innocent life,"" said Congresswoman Mary Miller. ""Allowing abortion under this law directly contradicts its purpose. My bill will restore its original intent, protect unborn babies, and stand for the sanctity of life.""  

""The Biden administration's radical expansion of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act has twisted a law meant to protect expectant mothers into a tool forcing employers to facilitate abortions, directly contradicting its original intent to support women who choose to carry their pregnancies to term. I'm proud to support Rep. Mary Miller's Love Them Both Act, which stops this regulatory overreach by ensuring pregnancy accommodations support life, not end it, while ensuring the PWFA returns to its intended purpose of helping pregnant workers continue working safely as they prepare for childbirth. No one should be forced to choose between their conscience and complying with federal law. This legislation accomplishes just that,"" said @RepublicanStudy Chairman @RepPfluger.

Yesterday in Apatzingán, Michoacán, Mexican soldiers were ambushed by cartel gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Mexico’s new administration doesn’t retreat. They called in the big guns—literally. An armed helicopter from Mexico’s Secretariat of National Defense was deployed and lit up the hillside. Five cartel fighters didn’t make it out.

After the confrontation, Mexican military and police launched a joint operation to secure the area and hunt down any remaining cartel gunmen.

For too long, cartel thugs have operated as a terrorist insurgency—with heavy weapons, tactical gear, and complete disregard for law and life. This is the moment. We have willing partners in Mexico, and a willing administration in the White House.

I’ve been beating the drum about getting legislation done that would deliver the resources to take the cartels out (a Black Hawk helicopter, for instance, is not an assault helicopter, as it’s easy to shoot down. They need better aircraft.)

"Baumgartner, Michael",Representative,Washington,5,Republican,House: 2025-Present,Yes,RepBaumgartner,'1908139309909344497',"How to RESTORE public college sports for taxpayers and athletes:
✅End the NCAA & Create a NEW ENTITY under Presidential Appointee
✅ Treat ALL athletes EQUALLY via pooled NIL sharing to reduce transfer “meat market” incentives 
✅ Share TV revenue EQUALLY across ALL schools and ALL sports to INCREASE the number of Olympic sports offered across the country 
✅ Salary cap coaches to end “arms race”
✅ Ban transcontinental conferences to put academics first.
✅ Participation will be VOLUNTARY for those schools wishing to continue to be eligible for federal student financial aid funding
✅ Participation will be VOLUNTARY for those student-athletes wishing to compete at a university which receives federal student financial aid funding.
✅ Participation will be VOLUNTARY for those coaches wishing to work at a university which receives federal student financial aid funding. 

College sports at highly subsidized taxpayer funded universities are a PUBLIC GOOD and should REGULATED as such.

In an increasingly politically polarized country, college sports play an important role in social cohesion. Young athletes need increased opportunities. We don’t need a 2nd NFL, controlled by corporate TV Execs with all of the $ going to football in the SEC & Big Ten. The PUBLIC INTEREST is in MORE SPORTS OPPORTUNITIES for the CHILDREN OF TAXPAYERS.

Congress grants anti-trust exemptions and salary caps to private pro sports in the name of COMPETITIVE BALANCE. It can easily do the same for public universities.

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1908149254276677794',"Poor Anna, you are being used by the Democrats to bring back proxy voting when you are clearly, in your own words, against people receiving taxpayer funded paychecks working from home.

In the 117th Congress (you weren’t with us yet because you had lost your election) Speaker Pelosi allowed proxy voting.

And it became the Democrats greatest tool to accomplish their agenda.

Many of the Democrats stayed home, proxy voted, and handed their voting cards over to Democrat leadership which allowed them to ram through their destructive Democrat agenda and by simply casting all the votes they needed to do it because they had the majority.

And it’s incredibly naive to believe your Democrat friends that proxy voting will only be kept to maternity leave.

This is Pandora’s box and members of Congress will want more reasons to proxy vote like sick leave, family occasions, and on and on. 

They already talk about it!

Serving in Congress is a privilege, not a career choice. 

If you need a job with better perks like maternity leave then step down and allow someone else to serve in your place.

Having children and prioritizing them over politics is certainly respectable and worthy. 

But you should not be fighting 96% of Republicans, your own party, to change the way Congress has worked from our founding.

You should be fighting this hard for what the American people voted for, Trump’s agenda! 

So like you said.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1908191007793094931',"Each week, we share remarkable stories from across our district of people who reflect the highest ideals of service, character, and devotion to others. Today, we honor one such man: a true hometown hero, Edward C. Wallace, whom we sadly lost last week. Ed was a proud Marine, police officer, and, above all, a man whose life was rooted in unwavering commitment—to country, community, and family.
 
Raised in Croydon and a resident of Levittown for over 45 years, Ed made every place he touched better. Humble in presence yet profound in impact, he lived with sincerity, strength, and a heart for service. As a young man, Ed answered his country’s call, enlisting in the @USMC and serving with distinction in the Vietnam War. He rose to the rank of Sergeant and received numerous military honors—including the Vietnam Service Medal with Two Stars, the National Defense Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, and the Rifle Expert Badge.
 
After returning home, Ed continued to serve—spending over two decades with the @BristolTwpPD and later with the Tullytown Police. For Ed, service wasn’t a duty. It was who he was.

A proud Irish-American and member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Ed honored his heritage through fellowship and tradition. Later in life, he taught himself to play the bagpipes—an act of reverence he used to honor others during parades, funerals, and ceremonies. Through music, as in life, Ed served with quiet dignity and deep respect.
 
Just a few weeks ago, I had the profound honor of spending time with Ed and witnessing the presentation of his Quilt of Valor—a national expression of gratitude for those who have borne the burdens of war. As the quilt was laid upon him, it was clear we weren’t just honoring his service—but the spirit in which he lived: selflessly, humbly, and with enduring grace.
 
To his beloved wife Sharon, his children, grandchildren, and all who knew him—our community grieves with you. We are forever grateful for Ed’s life, service, and enduring example.

May God bless the memory of Ed Wallace—a patriot, a protector, and a true hometown hero.",en,Tweet,1,7,0,2,1279.0,2025-04-04 17:12:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GntBmyyXMAA-1k4.jpg

For too long, bad trade deals have squeezed the middle class, manufacturing, and damaged our national security. I believe tariffs are an important tool to support American workers, and when used strategically to fight cheap steel from China, tariffs can be critical in protecting our domestic industry.

But what President Donald Trump has done is reckless.

Instead of using a scalpel to strengthen our workforce, the President has imposed universal tariffs on all imports including on our closest trading partners. 

For the farmers in Central and Southern Illinois, this is a direct hit to their livelihoods. Tariffs drive up the cost of imported goods, from machinery to feed, and make it harder to sell crops overseas, putting their operations in jeopardy.

Now, China has retaliated, and the stock market is crashing. While people's savings plummet and they look for reassurance, the President is golfing. It's unacceptable.

Congress has a role to play here. I am ready to work with the President to negotiate stronger trade agreements that prioritize our workers, rather than strain our economy. By heeding advice from members and their districts, we can find a path forward that will LOWER costs for folks, not make it even harder to afford everyday essentials.

"Lee, Mike",Senator,Utah,,Republican,Senate: 2011-Present,Yes,SenMikeLee,'1908210526100087260',"This week I introduced the Stopping Harmful Incidents to Enforce Lawful Drone Use (SHIELD-U) Act and the Drone Integration and Zoning Act.
 
These bills equip state and local law enforcement with the authority needed to protect their citizens, communities, and airports from drone threats.

The current regulatory environment stifles state and local governments’ ability to mitigate drone threats. The FAA currently regulates “navigable airspace” which is defined as “above the minimum altitudes of flight” which is typically 500 ft. However, the FAA has taken some liberties in recent years and stated that minimum altitude of flight for drones is above a blade of grass. 

Right now, Congress has exclusively granted limited authority to detect and takedown a drone only to the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Department of Energy. 

According to a Blue Ribbon Task Force Report commissioned by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) and Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA), one challenge in meeting current drone threats is the federal government’s lack of human resources or capital to invest in and operate counter drone technology at airports. 

When considered beyond an airport environment, the challenge becomes even greater, because federal law does not permit state or local law enforcement to take action. 

The SHIELD-U and Drone Integration and Zoning Acts provide essential tools for state and local law enforcement to address the danger of drones used against Americans that federal regulations have failed to adequately manage. 

By empowering local authorities, these bills ensure that communities and airports have the resources needed to safeguard their citizens and infrastructure from potential harm. 

With the increasing prevalence of drone-related incidents, it is vital to enable local enforcement to act swiftly and effectively in protecting public safety.",en,Tweet,1,111,22,23,9231.0,2025-04-04 18:30:16,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

"Murkowski, Lisa",Senator,Alaska,,Republican,Senate: 2002-Present,Yes,lisamurkowski,'1908593674298011772',"Early this morning, I voted for the Senate budget resolution. I support the extension of President Trump’s tax cuts and look forward to a reconciliation measure that will boost Alaska’s resource production. There are serious shortcomings within this resolution that gave me considerable pause, but overall, I recognize this is the start of a process, not the end. 
 
The resolution’s shortcomings include the adoption of a current policy baseline, a requirement for the Senate to increase the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, the setting of a path that will result in more than $50 trillion in federal debt within a decade, and a reconciliation instruction to a House committee that would require significant cuts to Medicaid. I supported an amendment to strike that instruction during our late-night vote series, but unfortunately, it fell short.  
 
As we turn next to the budget reconciliation process, I will push for a bill that keeps tax rates low, strengthens our economy and our security, and facilitates resource production in Alaska while avoiding harmful cuts to health coverage and the worsening of our fiscal situation. If the final bill falls short on any of those fronts, I would be unable to support its passage.",en,Tweet,7,145,18,210,43412.0,2025-04-05 19:52:46,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Getting the two chambers together will allow us to finally begin the most important phase of this process: drafting the reconciliation bill that will deliver on President Trump’s agenda and our promises to the American people.

There are several key things to remember as we move forward:

The budget resolution is not the law itself, but only the necessary kickoff for reconciliation to begin.

The Senate amendment as passed makes NO CHANGES to the House reconciliation instructions that we passed weeks ago. Although the Senate chose to take a different approach on its instructions, the amended resolution in NO WAY prevents us from achieving our goals in the final reconciliation bill.

We have and will continue to make it clear in all discussions with the Senate and the White House that—in order to secure House passage—the final reconciliation bill must include historic spending reductions while protecting essential programs.

After close consultation with President Trump and Majority Leader Thune, we all agree that the “One Big Beautiful Bill” must be drafted using a collaborative process that results in a single product that can be passed by both chambers and signed into law. We have made it clear the House will NOT accept nor participate in an “us versus them” process resulting in a take-it-or-leave-it proposition from the Senate.

As soon as we pass the final budget resolution, our House and Senate committees will begin preparing together their respective titles of the reconciliation bill to be marked up in the next work period. As always, this will involve input from all Members and will keep us on track to send a bill to the President’s desk by Memorial Day.

Recently, Trump and RFK Jr. unlawfully fired 20,000 public servants at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and stripped away core functions Americans rely on like ensuring the safety of medications and medical products, delivering essential health care services, and advancing life-saving research.

Just days ago, scientists at the NIH announced a major breakthrough in cancer treatment. But instead of building on that progress, Trump’s anti-science agenda is blocking it. These cuts aren’t just bureaucratic – they’re dangerous. This administration is crippling our response to public health threats, weakening the CDC, CMS, FDA, and more, and unraveling the infrastructure we need in a crisis.

Discarding science, silencing experts, and dismantling HHS puts millions at risk. We must reverse course, restore our nation’s commitment to high-quality, accessible care, and reengage with the global institutions working to protect the health of all people.

15,000 veterans who relied on the Veterans Affairs Servicing Purchase (VASP) program now face an uncertain future. And 80,000 more veterans already on the brink of foreclosure no longer have a viable option to stay in their homes.

At a time when veterans are already grappling with economic hardship, job insecurity, and threats to their health care, this decision puts their homes and their futures at risk.

No one who has served our nation in uniform should be living on the street or facing housing insecurity. We have a sacred responsibility to our veterans – and ending this program is a shameful betrayal of that promise.

What made this year especially meaningful for me was having my dad, Jim Fitzpatrick, a proud Korean War veteran, by my side. Sharing this experience with him—among our fellow hometown heroes—was something I’ll carry with me forever.

One of the most touching sights was seeing local students lining the route with flags and handmade signs, thanking our heroes who have given so much—it made the day even more special for everyone involved.

Grateful as always to Tour of Honor President Joe Szafran, the @BensalemSchools Marine Corps JROTC, Senior Marine Instructor Colonel John Church, the outstanding Bensalem JROTC Cadets, @parxcasino, and all who helped make this unforgettable tribute possible.

The loss of critical funding would disrupt promising work already underway and delay breakthroughs that patients across the country are counting on.

I am calling on NIH leadership to provide transparency around the grant cancellation process and to fully consider the long-term impact these decisions will have on public health, medical progress, and regional economies.

I’m actively working with my colleagues through the appropriations process to secure strong NIH funding—and I’ll continue pushing to ensure that institutions like the PA Biotech Center have the stability and support they need to keep moving science forward.

Let’s be clear: What is happening now is not about cutting care. It is about reforming a bloated bureaucracy that has protected underperforming employees for years, often at the expense of veterans. The VA has been on the Government Accountability Office’s high-risk list since 2015. That means for nearly a decade, independent watchdogs have flagged serious, systemic failures in patient safety, access to care, staffing, and infrastructure. 

Despite the propaganda of the usual people who just parrot what they are told, the number of job reductions is not 84,000. To date, only 2,400 jobs have been cut, 0.005% of the total VA headcount, and all were probationary employees in non-critical positions such as PR, interior design, and DEI. 

The VA is going through a process to find ways to improve care and benefits for veterans. All mission-critical providers such as doctors, nurses, or claims processors are EXEMPT from cuts. To add to that, supervisors have the opportunity to request that their employees be exempted from hiring freezes and probationary removal.

The last four years have shown that higher headcounts do not equate with better outcomes. Under the Biden administration, 52,000 additional employees were brought into the VA, bringing the total staff headcount to 470,000. Yet the average wait times for various services increased as the agency grew. 

From 2021 to 2024:
- Wait times for primary care grew from 15 days to 24 days — a 60% increase
- Wait times for mental health care grew from 14 days to 20 days — a 42% increase
- Wait times for specialty care grew from 24 days to 38 days — a 58% increase
- Additionally, the disability claims backlog increased.

More money and more people did not translate to better care for our veterans. It just made the system bigger, slower, and harder to navigate. 

Veterans are not asking for a larger VA bureaucracy. They are asking for a VA that actually works. As your Congressman, I’m committed to delivering for our veterans and ensuring that they receive the care they deserve. That means modernizing outdated systems, reducing inefficiency, and focusing on achieving results instead of growing headcounts.",en,Tweet,0,10,1,2,413.0,2025-04-08 18:58:45,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

At today’s @WaysandMeansGOP Health Subcommittee Hearing on Lowering Costs for Patients, I continued advocating for solutions that increase access and affordability—like expanding the use of biosimilars.

Biosimilars are safe, effective alternatives to costly biologics and could dramatically reduce out-of-pocket expenses. But despite their promise, outdated Medicare reimbursement policies and a lack of provider incentives have slowed their adoption.

Improving Medicare’s Part B payment model is a targeted, bipartisan solution that would help increase biosimilar use, reduce costs, and ensure more patients benefit from the full range of available therapies.

Patients shouldn’t have to choose between access and affordability. We can and must do both.

As Co-Chair of the Congressional Coal Caucus, I fully support President Trump’s commitment to an all-of-the-above and all-of-the-below energy solution that works for Pennsylvania and the nation. I look forward to working with the White House to implement this America-First energy agenda.
