The Japanese had controlled the islands since May 1942, after American forces were defeated and MacArthur was forced to leave. However, in October 1944, over 100,000 American troops landed on Leyte Island, leading to one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific war and signaling Japan‚Äôs impending defeat.

This victory paved the way for an American landing of over 60,000 troops on Luzon. Despite little initial opposition, Japanese kamikazes struck U.S. vessels, killing 49 American sailors. As American forces advanced, they discovered a network of Japanese caves and tunnels designed to lure them inland. The Japanese fought fiercely, hoping to delay the American push toward Japan.

Today, I officially introduced my bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America.

Mexican cartels currently use the Gulf of Mexico to traffic humans, drugs, weapons, and God knows what else while the Mexican government allows them to do it.

The American people are footing the bill to protect and secure the maritime waterways for commerce to be conducted. Our U.S. armed forces protect the area from any military threats from foreign countries.

It‚Äôs our gulf. The rightful name is the Gulf of America and it‚Äôs what the entire world should refer to it as.

Immediately following President Trump‚Äôs announcement, I directed my staff to get the bill drafted. I submitted the bill this afternoon with 14 original cosponsors.

My bill directs the Chairman of the Board on Geographic Names under the Secretary of the Interior to rename all federal documents and maps within 180 days of being signed into law.

Congress has to take the Trump Agenda mandate seriously and that means acting fast to enact it.

This is a piece of Day 1 legislation that can easily be awaiting President Trump‚Äôs signature the moment he takes his oath of office.

I urge my colleagues to join me to quickly pass this bill.",en,Tweet,196,8797,2006,2867,1858843.0,2025-01-09 21:43:39,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg4eN1KX0AAaJzw.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg4eN1KWsAAJosL.jpg"

When Caesar's term in Gaul ended, the Senate demanded that he disband his army and return to Rome as a private citizen or be declared an enemy of the state. This put Caesar in a vulnerable position, as he could face prosecution for actions during his consulship and campaigns. Caesar chose to act, crossing the Rubicon with his army during the night. By doing so, he declared war on Rome, uttering the phrase ""Alea iacta est"" (""The die is cast"").

This bold move ignited a civil war, culminating in Caesar's victory. He seized control of Rome and ruled as dictator for life. The phrase ""crossing the Rubicon"" has since become a metaphor for taking an irreversible, decisive step.",en,Tweet,5,72,7,6,3525.0,2025-01-10 12:26:22,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg7oQMBWEAAMhlL.jpg

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1877774264192925772',"Each week, we celebrate the stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district‚Äîremarkable individuals whose actions ripple outward and go beyond the ordinary. Today, we shine a light on a man who has dedicated his life to our safety, our justice, and our community. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero: Pat McGinty of Middletown Township.

For nearly four decades, Pat McGinty stood as a protector and cornerstone of our community. From the moment he first pinned on the badge in 1974, Pat embraced a calling that was not just a job, but a profound commitment to serve. As a patrolman, K-9 detective, lieutenant, sergeant, and acting public safety director, he didn‚Äôt just uphold the law‚Äîhe wove himself into the very fabric of Middletown Township, becoming a beacon of safety, justice, and compassion.

Pat‚Äôs dedication went far beyond the routine duties of a police officer. He carried the weight of some of our community‚Äôs darkest moments, always rising to meet the call with integrity and resolve. Whether it was reopening cold cases to bring long-overdue justice to grieving families, ensuring that no rookie officer bore the emotional burden of a death notification alone, or leading the investigation of the tragic loss of Newtown Police Officer Brian Gregg in 2005, Pat approached every challenge with a steady hand and a compassionate heart. He understood that behind every case, every tragedy, there were human lives‚Äîfamilies yearning for closure, communities yearning for healing.

A graduate of the FBI's National Academy, a prestigious training course in Quantico, Va., for law enforcement leaders across the globe, he earned the respect of law enforcement leaders across the country, while never losing sight of the community he served at home. He was a mentor to fellow officers, a guide to those starting their careers, and a symbol of excellence in law enforcement. Pat elevated those around him, creating a legacy of leadership that continues to shape the next generation of our officers.

But perhaps what speaks most to Pat‚Äôs character is his humility. He never sought recognition or accolades. For Pat, service was its own reward. Even after his retirement in 2011, he continued to give back, working in juvenile fingerprinting and DNA analysis at the Doylestown Courthouse.

This past Saturday, as a parade of officers and firefighters from across our region came together to honor Pat, it was clear just how deeply he is woven into the heart of this community. Recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of terminal cancer, Pat reminded us of the profound truth of his life‚Äôs work: ‚ÄúThe impact of this work reaches far beyond the badge.‚Äù

Pat McGinty hasn‚Äôt just serve our community‚Äîhe has shaped it. He has stood with us in times of joy and sorrow, in moments of triumph and tragedy. He has been more than a law enforcement officer; he has been a guardian of our safety, a champion of justice, and a steadfast presence in our lives. His legacy is not written in medals or titles, but in the countless lives he has touched, the peace he has preserved, and the community he has helped protect.

To Pat‚Äôs beloved wife Nancy, his children, and his grandchildren: your sacrifices and unwavering support have been a cornerstone of Pat‚Äôs service. You have shared him with all of us, and for that, we are forever grateful.

Pat, you are more than a hero‚Äîyou are a symbol of what it means to give everything for the good of others. On behalf of an immensely grateful community, thank you for your service, your sacrifice, and your steadfast dedication to making our world a better, safer place. May God bless you and your family, and know that your lifetime of service will continue to inspire our community forever.",en,Tweet,0,4,0,1,841.0,2025-01-10 17:47:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg8xvPIXsAAiPGS.jpg

The real issue here is control. The Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to build a blueprint of influence over you and our society. They‚Äôre not just tracking what you do; they‚Äôre deciding what you see, and therefore *how you think*. There is plenty of evidence this is already happening.

Now imagine how much more powerful it would be as an information warfare weapon when the proverbial shit hits the fan in a potential conflict over Taiwan. Yeah, the Chinese will take control of all advanced semi-conductor chips in Taiwan (the ones that power your precious smartphone), and then use your addiction to TikTok to convince you it‚Äôs all a good idea.

TikTok, as an entertainment platform, is an incredible product. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs creative, and millions of Americans love using it. But we also need to recognize that it‚Äôs a Trojan horse. And right now, that horse is carrying Chinese Communist Party influence into our backyard and sending American‚Äôs data back to Beijing. That‚Äôs the problem we need to solve.

The goal here is not about trying to stop American small businesses who use TikTok to promote themselves, the latest dances, or end ‚Äúbrain rot‚Äù trends‚Äîthough maybe fixing that wouldn‚Äôt hurt either. It‚Äôs about making sure that enjoyment doesn‚Äôt come at the cost of our privacy, our freedom, or our national security.

There‚Äôs a way to fix this. We don‚Äôt need to kill TikTok; we need to kick the Chinese Communist Party out of it. Ownership by someone who shares‚Äîor at least respects‚Äîour democratic values is the solution. People like Kevin O‚ÄôLeary from Shark Tank and Dodgers owner Frank McCourt are already exploring a potential acquisition.
