"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1849411886854369758',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1929, known as Black Thursday, the U.S. stock market experienced a dramatic decline, marking the beginning of a catastrophic financial crisis that contributed to the Great Depression. 

This event followed a period of significant economic optimism during the Roaring Twenties, characterized by rising stock prices and rampant speculation. The crisis began on October 23, when stock prices fell 4.6%, leading to widespread panic among investors. On Black Thursday, an unprecedented 12.9 million shares were traded, far exceeding previous records. This surge overwhelmed stockbrokers, causing delays and inaccuracies in trade reports, which intensified the sense of chaos. In response to the turmoil, police were dispatched to the New York Stock Exchange to maintain order, while Wall Street executives attempted to reassure the public.

Leading up to the crash, many stocks were purchased on margin, meaning investors borrowed money to buy shares, which left them vulnerable to sudden price drops. While some economists had raised alarms about the market's sustainability, many investors remained hopeful, believing prices would continue to rise.

In a bid to stabilize the market, major banks and investment firms intervened by purchasing large blocks of stocks. Initially, this action seemed to quell the panic, as the market closed only slightly down for the day. However, the temporary boost did little to restore confidence. On the following days, known as Black Monday and Black Tuesday, stock prices plummeted further.

The aftermath of Black Thursday triggered a ripple effect across the economy, contributing to decreased manufacturing and rising unemployment. While the crash was a pivotal moment, economists continue to debate whether it was a direct cause of the Great Depression or a symptom of underlying economic weaknesses.",en,Tweet,0,25,6,9,2150.0,2024-10-24 12:25:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GapuT0aWcAAxtAE.jpg

I am proud to have secured nearly $4 million in federal funding for this project, including a $1 million earmark I announced just two years ago, along with $2.9 million from the American Rescue Plan.

Today, we shine a spotlight on an extraordinary young girl whose strength and compassion exemplify what it truly means to be a hero. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero—ten-year-old Francesca ""Frankie"" Wilson of Chalfont.
 
At just five years old, after her father Dan was diagnosed with lung cancer, Frankie went to school, grabbed the microphone at lunch, and rallied her peers to join her in prayer. But that was only the beginning of her journey as an advocate. Frankie became a driving force behind Links for Lungs, the nonprofit her family launched to raise funds for lung cancer research. Year after year, Frankie has been front and center, hosting lemonade stands and working at the family’s golf outings to ensure no family facing lung cancer feels alone. With every action she has taken, she shows that even the youngest among us can be powerful agents of change.
 
Then, in a heartbreaking twist, this February, Frankie faced a battle of her own—her own cancer diagnosis. But where others might falter, Frankie drew from her strength and faith, meeting the challenge with the same resolve she has shown for years. 
 
Even as she endures months of chemotherapy, radiation, and the possibility of surgery, Frankie’s advocacy hasn’t slowed. She speaks openly about her diagnosis with friends, offering them a space to ask questions. In the hospital, she encourages other children—comforting them with kind words about feeding tubes, hair loss, and nutrition. Her mother, Brittany, put it best: “She embraces everything with her spunky spirit.”
 
Frankie Wilson teaches us a profound lesson: no matter the size of the struggle, we always have the choice to meet it with courage, love, and grace. Her resilience shows us that even in life's most difficult moments, we can still choose hope, find purpose, and make an impact on the world around us.
 
Please join me in celebrating and praying for this extraordinary young lady and the entire Wilson family. Frankie, your courage and spirit inspire us all. Your community stands with you, cheering you on every step of the way. God bless you, Frankie—you are a true Hometown Hero.",en,Tweet,0,7,1,2,571.0,2024-10-25 17:08:10,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gav4l56WMAAE8Lz.jpg

Did you know that prescription drugs are often thrown in the trash, where they can be retrieved, abused, or illegally sold? It's important to note that you should NOT throw away or flush expired or unneeded prescription drugs down the drain.

Official prescription drug collection sites are a great way to safely dispose of your unneeded or leftover prescriptions.

Tomorrow, October 26th, be sure to swing by a participating location to drop off any prescription drugs you no longer need.

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1850140012853039341',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1881, the Earp brothers confronted the Clanton-McLaury gang in the most famous Wild West shootout at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona. 

Tombstone had rapidly developed into a wealthy mining town after silver was discovered nearby in 1877. Wyatt Earp, a former police officer, and his brothers, Morgan and Virgil (the town marshal), embodied law enforcement but were also seen as ruthless. The Clantons and McLaurys were cowboys involved in cattle rustling and criminal activities. Tensions between these groups escalated, leading to the deadly confrontation at the O.K. Corral.

The day prior, Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury arrived in Tombstone for supplies and quickly clashed with the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday. The following afternoon, Ike's brother Billy, along with Frank McLaury and Billy Claiborne, joined them. At a local saloon, they learned from Holliday that their brothers had been pistol-whipped by the Earps, prompting Frank and Billy to seek revenge.

By 3 p.m., the Earps and Holliday encountered the Clanton-McLaury gang in a vacant lot near the O.K. Corral. The ensuing gunfight lasted about 30 seconds, with around 30 shots fired. Most accounts suggest that Virgil Earp fired the first shot, hitting Billy Clanton, while Doc Holliday shot Tom McLaury. Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton also returned fire but were both fatally wounded. Ike Clanton and Claiborne fled the scene.

Sheriff John Behan charged the Earps and Holliday with murder, but a month later, a judge found them not guilty, stating they were justified in their actions. The shootout has since been depicted in numerous films, including 𝐹𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑟 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑙 and 𝑇𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒.",en,Tweet,1,29,7,5,2770.0,2024-10-26 12:38:47,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ga0EiLMa4AANrd_.jpg

The push for alcohol prohibition began in the early 19th century with temperance societies, gaining momentum by the late 19th century as these groups became politically influential. The 18th Amendment was ratified in January 1919, making it illegal to manufacture, sell, or transport intoxicating liquors.

The Volstead Act, enacted later that year, aimed to enforce these laws, including forming a special Treasury unit. However, it struggled to curb the illegal alcohol trade, leading to a rise in organized crime. Figures like Al Capone became notorious during this time, illustrating how organized crime thrived in response to the ban on alcohol.

The era also saw the rise of speakeasies—illegal bars that became popular social hubs. Ultimately, Prohibition was repealed in 1933 by the 21st Amendment.",en,Tweet,0,17,3,4,2488.0,2024-10-28 11:30:45,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ga-V4FkX0AAk96c.jpg

First, as @VP, she is responsible for her administration's record. That means 40-year high inflation, 10.2M illegal migrants (that we know about), crime & safety, etc.

Beyond that, Kamala Harris has cast some of the most significant tie-breaking economic votes in history. She is the reason we're stuck with the Inflation Expansion Act. 

Biden tapped her to lead on immigration. We know how that turned out. Harris said she was proud to be ""last in the room"" during the deadly Afghanistan disaster, and still claims to be part of most key policy decisions.

Instead Democrats are outraged at a comedian that spoke last night.

However, a quick google search reveals severe waste management problems plaguing Puerto Rico that has also been hit by multiple devastating hurricanes in recent years.

Also, a 2024 federal audit report showed that less than 10% of more than $23 billion in available federal funds have been spent in Puerto Rico under the Biden Harris administration.

They don’t care about Puerto Rico and neither do Democrat activists in the media as they’ve reported many times about the problems Puerto Rico faces.

Glenn was a decorated U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant colonel and one of NASA's first astronauts selected in 1959. He had a distinguished military career, flying nearly 150 combat missions and making the first nonstop supersonic flight across the U.S. in 1957.

Following Yuri Gagarin's historic flight in 1961, Glenn's Friendship 7 mission made him a national hero as it orbited the Earth three times. He was celebrated with a visit from President Kennedy and a ticker-tape parade.

After his historic flight, Glenn was largely sidelined by NASA due to concerns for his safety. He turned to politics, running for the U.S. Senate from Ohio, but withdrew due to an injury. He eventually won a Senate seat and was re-elected three times, serving until his retirement in 1999.
