This solemn anniversary is also a grim reminder that the same forces of hate and destruction continue to threaten the Armenian people today. In 2020, Azerbaijan waged a campaign of violence and terror against Armenians in Artsakh. Thousands were driven from their homes, prisoners were tortured, civilians executed, and centuries-old churches destroyed. A brutal 10-month blockade led to starvation and suffering before the region was emptied of its Armenian population. This was not merely war ‚Äì it was the deliberate erasure of a people from their homeland.

We must never forget the concerted efforts that saw Armenians from all walks of life rounded up, tortured, burned alive, and marched until death from exhaustion and starvation. Entire families wiped out as a result of what the U.S. Ambassador at the time called a 'campaign of race extermination.‚Äô The first genocide of the 20th century.

Today‚Äôs anniversary also reminds us that the United States for too long stood in dishonorable silence on these events. While the Congress and the White House have finally taken that step to recognize the Armenian Genocide, there is more work to do in order to fully support our Armenian neighbors and friends. We must never retreat from that important progress.

I have sat down with survivors and have watched them relive the pain of this history over and over. We cannot pledge ‚Äònever again‚Äô if we do not also acknowledge that, even a century later, the wounds of this tragedy are still open. And in tragic ways, they begin anew.

Turkey continues to engage in a long and dangerous campaign to deny the genocide and silence anyone who speaks the truth. Azerbaijan has also echoed the genocidal language and actions of a century ago, and with the support of Turkey, attacked Artsakh in 2020 and blockaded it for nearly ten months starting in December 2022. In 2023, the Aliyev regime took full advantage of a people they had systematically starved and ethnically cleansed Artsakh‚Äôs indigenous Armenian population.

We must hold Azerbaijan and those who continue to threaten Armenia and its people accountable. Only after the genocide is universally acknowledged and the continued threats to the Armenian community are ended can we truly say they we have honored the memory of those who were lost one hundred and ten years ago and stood with those who still carry those memories today.

The United States must call for Azerbaijan‚Äôs release of Armenian hostages, advocate for the protected return of Armenians to Artsakh, and call attention to the destruction and desecration of Armenian religious and cultural sites by Azerbaijan in its effort to erase Armenian culture and history. The United States must also urge the immediate withdrawal of Azerbaijani forces from Armenian territory, release of prisoners of war, support Armenia‚Äôs sovereignty, maintain international monitoring on Armenia‚Äôs borders, and provide security assistance to Armenia.

Despite the trials the Armenian people have faced and continue to face, it has not broken their faith, determination, or their will to survive. Time and time again, the Armenian people have overcome enormous hardship and loss, and yet, still remain strong and unbowed.

From shoulder to shoulder in our community to the U.S. Senate, I will always stand with the Armenian community.",en,Tweet,13,727,133,175,33691.0,2025-04-24 15:40:01,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Congressman Patronis Appointed to House Committee on Small Business
¬†
WASHINGTON, D.C. ‚Äì Today, Congressman Jimmy Patronis announced his appointment to the United States House of Representatives Committee on Small Business. In addition to the Committee on Small Business, Congressman Patronis is expected to serve on the Subcommittee on Rural Development, Energy, and Supply Chains; the Subcommittee on Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Workforce Development; and the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Regulations.
¬†
Congressman Jimmy Patronis said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm honored to be appointed to the House Committee on Small Business and look forward to being a strong voice for hardworking Floridians and small businesses that form the backbone of America‚Äôs economy. More than 33 million small businesses in the United States account for more than 43% of the nation‚Äôs total GDP. Florida is home to more than three million small businesses, which make up more than 99% of all businesses in the state. My thanks to @SpeakerJohnson, Majority Leader @SteveScalise, Majority Whip @tomemmer, and Small Business Committee Chairman @RepRWilliams for the opportunity to help craft and support policies that will foster fiscal responsibility, cut red tape, and grow an economy that works for everyone. As a former small business owner and working my entire life in the restaurant business, I know how hard it is for small business owners to earn a living and make payroll. I‚Äôm excited to work with my colleagues on the Committee to protect our small businesses, provide better opportunities to live the American dream, and help President Trump Make America Wealthy Again.‚Äù
¬†
House Committee on Small Business Chairman Roger Williams said, ‚ÄúI want to congratulate Rep. Patronis on his appointment to the House Committee on Small Business for the 119th Congress. His dedication to America‚Äôs small businesses and real-world experience will bring valuable insight to the Committee. I look forward to working together as we tackle the challenges facing Main Street and champion pro-growth solutions over the next two years.‚Äù
¬†
The U.S. House Committee on Small Business was created to craft better protections and government policies for America‚Äôs Small Businesses. The Committee is responsible for evaluating and addressing the challenges faced by small businesses and analyzing how broader business practices and trends affect them. The Committee holds legislative and oversight authority over the Small Business Administration and its initiatives. It also supports and safeguards small businesses by facilitating access to financial assistance and promoting their involvement in federal procurement and government contracting opportunities.

It‚Äôs not just personal connections that are strong here, but economic connections. Trade with Canada, visitors, and customers are a crucial part of the local economy in Northwest Washington.

Yet, every week Trump seems to find a new way to drive a wedge between us and our Canadian allies, and a new way to drive business away from our communities. He‚Äôs whipping up a fact-free frenzy about drugs at the Canadian border. The fact is: less than 1 percent of fentanyl intercepted at the U.S. border is from Canada. He has created complete chaos and fear for every day travelers crossing our border. People coming here for work, or just for visits, have been detained. His border theatrics are scaring away tourists and scaring off business.

And the pointless, painful trade war is in reality an enormous tax paid by our families.

Trump is pushing away some of our most important trade partners, raising prices for families at the grocery store, and pushing small businesses to the brink‚Äîsome may even shutter. All of this is incredibly harmful to our communities‚Äîit‚Äôs not the way we should treat our neighbors, and it‚Äôs catastrophic for business too.

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1915752750664622106',"Congress is not doing its job and to deliver the People‚Äôs mandate.

By Joe Biden‚Äôs 100 days, Congress had delivered 11 bills to Biden‚Äôs desk including their reconciliation package the American ‚ÄúRescue‚Äù Plan spending $1.9 trillion dollars on Covid insanity, Trans and DEI, and open border policies to fund the invasion of America.

Nancy Pelosi was a machine. 

And Democrats didn‚Äôt have 60 votes in the Senate, but they got it done.

President Trump hits 100 days on April 30th and we have only sent 5 bills to his desk: Laken Riley Act, 3 joint resolutions blocking Biden agency rules, and a full Biden/Democrat government funding CR that I should have never been required to vote for, but only did it because President Trump asked me to in order to avoid a gov shutdown.

But he had no other option to get behind either because Congress gave him none.

The Republican controlled House should be passing Trump‚Äôs executive orders every week.

Weekly, we should be passing rescissions with ease cutting Biden era spending, policies and fraud that DOGE has uncovered, as these only require 51 votes in the Senate not 60. 

And we should finish the reconciliation package asap that will pass the most critical funding legislation we are able to accomplish of Energy, Border, and Tax legislation as it only requires 51 votes in the Senate as well. 

I‚Äôve been silent and hopeful that our Republican controlled House and Senate understood the historic mandate and responsibility that the people demanded in November, and would finally be convinced that America did not vote for standard Republican Party policies, America voted for TRUMP AMERICA FIRST MAGA POLICIES, and Congress MUST deliver.

I ran for Congress in 2020 after being infuriated from watching Republicans in Congress undermine President Trump‚Äôs agenda and disgusted at Republicans in Washington refusing to defend our President from the Democrat‚Äôs silent civil war and coup against OUR President.

I will not willingly go along with another Republican Congress that doesn‚Äôt understand the moment we are in and courageously seize it.

We are facing a Democrat judicial coup unconstitutionally abusing the power of the courts to stop the will of the American people and defend and protect terrorists, cartel gang members, and illegal aliens who have broken our immigration laws, and now a ruling to continue election fraud by stopping President Trump‚Äôs executive order to require ID to prove citizenship in order to vote.

The Democrat Party is now openly the party of criminals, terrorists, MS-13, mentally ill trans, and big government control and crippling debt. 

My patience is wearing thin and the people are sick of it.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1915801297657143671',"Each week, we share stories of people across our district who rise above the ordinary and inspire us with their courage, compassion, and quiet strength. Today, we honor a woman whose leadership and service have shaped the very foundation of emergency care in Bucks County. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero: Barbara Stebulis, of Warminster, Paramedic Chief and Executive Director of Upper Bucks Regional EMS, Inc.
 
Barbara began her career as a teacher at Hatboro-Horsham High School. But it was through EMS that she found her life‚Äôs calling‚Äîand for over 40 years, she has answered that call with unwavering devotion. As a Paramedic, educator, mentor, and trailblazer, she has not only saved lives‚Äîshe has built a legacy.
 
She helped establish the Upper Bucks Chiefs Association and, alongside the late John Costello, helped unite the EMS communities of Upper and Lower Bucks, bringing strength through collaboration. Today, under her leadership, UBREMS remains a vital lifeline for nine Bucks County municipalities, responding to emergencies where others can‚Äôt‚Äîon hiking trails, in remote woodlands, and along the water.
 
And Barbara doesn‚Äôt just lead from behind a desk‚Äîshe leads with her hands, heart, and instinct to serve. While visiting a park in Northampton Township with her son Michael, a paramedic, they witnessed a man collapse on a nearby basketball court. Without hesitation, they rushed to his side, performed CPR, and delivered a lifesaving shock with an AED. It was quick, seamless, and second nature‚Äîbecause saving lives is who they are.
 
That instinct to serve is deeply personal for Barbara. After the heartbreaking loss of her son Brett‚Äîa sixth-generation firefighter with dreams of becoming a police officer‚ÄîBarbara and her husband Lenny turned their grief into purpose. In his memory, they became tireless advocates for the Gift of Life Foundation, raising countless funds and awareness for organ and tissue donation. Out of unimaginable loss, they built something powerful: a mission rooted in compassion and a legacy of healing that continues to touch lives.
 
When asked what keeps her going after four decades of service, Barbara answered with quiet grace, ‚ÄúTo hopefully leave things here a little better than we found them.‚Äù
 
She has done just that‚Äîand so much more.
 
As a certified EMT and Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I will always fight to ensure heroes like Barbara‚Äîand the extraordinary team at UBREMS‚Äîhave the resources, support, and recognition they deserve. Because when someone in our community is in need, they never hesitate. And neither will I.
 
Barbara Stebulis has served with courage, led with heart, and lifted our community time and again. We are safer, stronger, and better because of her. Thank you, Barbara. We are proud to call you this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero.",en,Tweet,2,7,1,4,1287.0,2025-04-25 17:13:17,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GpZLH30XEAEdNus.jpg

Every American should be deeply alarmed by this march towards authoritarianism and the profound implications it holds for our democracy. We must do everything within our power to protect the independence of our judiciary and preserve the integrity of our legal system.

"Lee, Mike",Senator,Utah,,Republican,Senate: 2011-Present,Yes,SenMikeLee,'1916936472479076817',"ABORTION PILL FLASHBACK: SENATE FLOOR 2020

First, the mother is given a pill that blocks progesterone ‚Äì a hormone necessary for pregnancy ‚Äì and breaks down the lining of her uterus. Without progesterone, the baby, whose heart is already beating, is starved to death and dies in her mother‚Äôs womb.

Then, 24 to 48 hours later, the mother is given a second pill that empties her uterus by causing severe contractions and bleeding, mimicking an early miscarriage that can last anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks.

Planned Parenthood will try to gloss over the truth, claiming that a hot shower and some ibuprofen are enough for a quick recovery to get the mother back on her feet.

But on average, the miscarriage lasts between 9 to 16 days and can last for as long as 30 days.

Most of the time these abortions are done at home; so the mother is left to suffer alone, without care or supervision from a doctor, and often without any follow-up until 7 to 14 days later ‚Äì if ever.

The result? Women have suffered tragic, gruesome, and horrific experiences from using the abortion pill.

It has caused nearly 4,200 adverse medical events ‚Äì including more than 1,000 hospitalizations, and nearly 600 instances of blood loss requiring transfusions.

Some women have even died. The FDA has reported 24 maternal deaths from the abortion pill since its approval in 2000. And those are just the officially reported ones that we know of that have happened even with the regulations we currently have in place.

Some women need corrective surgery after taking the abortion pill, and others need life-saving procedures.

And somehow, we call this ‚Äúhealthcare.‚Äù",en,Tweet,12,235,80,20,18203.0,2025-04-28 20:24:04,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916935099813068800/vid/avc1/1280x720/KR8UYDdAO1athRl6.mp4?tag=16

Thankfully law enforcement investigated this latest incident, involving a 45-year-old non-citizen who illegally voted in the November 2020 election in Saratoga County, according to a federal court filing. 

New York remains one of the few states without any form of voter identification requirement. That is unacceptable. Every legal voter‚Äîregardless of party‚Äîdeserves to know their vote is protected and not canceled out by fraud or abuse.

Democrats continue to undermine election integrity‚Äînot only by pushing noncitizen voting but by relentlessly opposing basic voter ID laws.

In March, the New York State Court of Appeals made the right decision in striking down Democrats‚Äô dangerous law allowing over 800,000 noncitizens to vote in New York City elections. This unconstitutional attempt to dilute the voice of American citizens was an egregious attack on our Republic. Voting is a fundamental right reserved for citizens, as clearly outlined in our state constitution.

I will continue to fight to safeguard our elections, protect the rights of lawful citizens, and demand accountability from those who try to compromise the security and integrity of our democratic process. It‚Äôs time for New York to act.

Among other notable achievements, the President has decreased illegal border crossings to the lowest amount in recorded history, stopped the invasion of our country by para-military drug cartels and violent criminals, deported criminal aliens in record numbers, and restored rule of law in our country.

We are right-sizing the bureaucracy, reining-in reckless spending, and rooting-out waste and fraud, and have already cut $200 billion in unnecessary burdensome regulations.
