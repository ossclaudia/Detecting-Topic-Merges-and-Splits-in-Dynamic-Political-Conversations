"Sanders, Bernard",Senator,Vermont,,Independent,"Senate: 2007-Present, House: 1991-2007",Yes,SenSanders,'1862157427031830528',"This time of year, I am always reminded of the Thanksgiving scene painted by one of my favorite artists, Norman Rockwell. Many people don‚Äôt know this, but Rockwell actually lived for a time in Arlington, Vermont, and painted some of his most well-known pieces there, including his ‚ÄúFour Freedoms.‚Äù He even used many of his Vermont neighbors as models and inspiration in his work.

Rockwell‚Äôs ‚ÄúFour Freedoms‚Äù series was published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1943. They were paintings that reflected the vision that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt articulated in his 1941 State of the Union speech: Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear.  

In that speech Roosevelt stated:

‚ÄúIn the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.

‚ÄúThe first is freedom of speech and expression‚Äîeverywhere in the world.

‚ÄúThe second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way‚Äîeverywhere in the world.

‚ÄúThe third is freedom from want‚Äîwhich, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants‚Äîeverywhere in the world.

‚ÄúThe fourth is freedom from fear‚Äîwhich, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor‚Äîanywhere in the world.

‚ÄúThat is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation. That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.‚Äù

In my view, Roosevelt‚Äôs vision from 1941 remains relevant today.

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1862510100147020276',"The War Machine.. 

I‚Äôll explain how it works and why I don‚Äôt vote for it.

The Defense Industrial Base is tax payer funded gov contracts with American companies to build weapons, ammunition, and military equipment - made in America with American jobs.

The pitch they give members of Congress and Senators is that we MUST vote for the annual defense budget and other programs in order to fund America‚Äôs military and defense of the United States of America.  

AND they always add how important these gov contracts are with American companies because they create jobs and continued funding protects these jobs.

They will also gladly show each of us a map of where these companies are, and number of jobs, in each of our districts or states, and to increase pressure on us they will throw in where military bases are in our districts.

This is implied understanding of how many votes that we could lose if we don‚Äôt vote YES to continue the funding for the defense contracts in our district and the number of military votes we could lose as well if we vote NO to military funding.

Of course add in the shaming of ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt support the military?!‚Äù

Many appropriation bills contain gov contracts with the defense industrial base which currently is an economic driver created by a business model that is built on murder, war, and destruction in foreign countries around the world.

The reason why I adamantly oppose this business model is because of the way it works.

They give away the older weapons, ammunition, and military equipment to countries the U.S. supports in the name of defending democracy and beating the current bad guy, in order to create the need to sign new defense contracts to build new weapons, ammunition, and military equipment to replenish the old.

Of course, giving away old weapons and equipment to countries like Ukraine comes with U.S. ‚Äúadvisers‚Äù on how to use these deadly gifts against their enemies, which also requires more funding. 

This is all in the name of ‚Äúresponsibility.‚Äù

This bloody business model creates an annual defense budget of over $850 billion per year, but that‚Äôs just the starter package. 

Funding foreign wars like Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, and all the rest actually have cost the American people TRILLIONS of their hard earned tax dollars that comes with the ‚Äúreasons‚Äù of creating American jobs and replenishing America‚Äôs military and to support the Military Industrial Economic Base.

When you combine the reality of American tax payers enslaved in debt by paying for murder and war in foreign lands that don‚Äôt affect us with stupid decisions by politicians and unelected bureaucrats that led us to $36 trillion in debt which has driven life to be unaffordable, open border policies that have empowered the international criminal cartels trafficking drugs, people, and killing Americans, crumbling infrastructure, dying prosperity and hope for young Americans, and the dumbing down of our youth through failing education and immoral cultural norms, this is why I adamantly OPPOSE and will FIGHT against this evil insanity.

You see when our self righteous government claims to defend freedom and democracy around the world, by regime change with its almighty military forces and strength, boasting about the taxpayer funded Military Industrial Economic Base, while virtually kicking the hard working American people in the gut every damn day making them pay for it all, while simultaneously not defending our own border, the people hate the government and it‚Äôs pathetic little shills in the media. 

It‚Äôs time to start a new era of economic prosperity for Americans that isn‚Äôt built on a never ending pile of foreign dead bodies.",en,Tweet,470,4987,1745,778,185016.0,2024-11-29 14:53:06,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gdj3EG5WcAAMVMm.jpg

Today, we shine a spotlight on a Bucks County native working to change lives‚Äîmeet Taylor Kreiling, founder of Dream Drive.
 
While Taylor has a successful career in Healthcare IT, her true calling lies in advocating for the well-being of children and families in need. Recognizing the pressing need to support underprivileged families year-round, especially children in foster care, Taylor founded Dream Drive in 2012. What began as a small effort with 25 volunteers has grown into a robust, community-wide network that has touched the lives of hundreds of children and families across Bucks County.
 
For the past nine years, Dream Drive has ensured that over 300 children experience the joy of Christmas‚Äîproviding gifts, festive celebrations, and the invaluable opportunity to create lasting memories filled with love and care. Furthermore, Taylor's mission extends beyond the holiday season; it is a year-round commitment of support. Dream Drive provides vital hygiene kits, backpacks filled with school supplies, pantry essentials, birthday celebrations, and seasonal care packages. But perhaps the most important part of her work is the unwavering support she provides to teens aging out of the foster care system‚Äîa vulnerable group often left to navigate adulthood without guidance or resources. Dream Drive provides tools and support to transition into independence and a brighter future. Taylor is also a fierce advocate for mental health awareness within the foster care system, partnering with organizations to bring about meaningful change.
 
Please join me in applauding Taylor Kreiling for her extraordinary dedication and selfless service to our community. She has sparked a transformative movement of inspiring hope, lifting spirits, changing lives, and creating a ripple of generosity throughout our community. Thank you, Taylor, you are a true Hometown Hero.",en,Tweet,1,8,1,2,879.0,2024-11-29 19:12:33,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdkybojXwAAbKiu.jpg

She constantly speaks out about the wide ranges of abuse and suffering her nephew and their family has endured. 

Matthew Perna was a non violent J6 defendant who tragically committed suicide under the unbearable weight of political persecution by U.S. attorney Matthew Graves from the DOJ.

Matthew Perna is not the only J6 defendant who committed suicide, sadly there are more.

I introduced the Matthew Perna Act, after Congressman Louie Ghomert left in order to stop political persecution in the justice system. There are no cosponsors. It is a good bill that should have bipartisan support as it allows protestors to get a fair trial and it was written by Louie Ghomert, who is formerly a judge and understands the justice system better than most.

Always remember that over 95% of Antifa/BLM protesters and violent rioters charges were dropped and they did not face political persecution.

Everyday to this day, people are still being arrested, charged, found guilty, and sentenced to prison for protesting the election on January 6, 2021 at the Capital. 

Matthew Graves has abused the power of his office perhaps more heinously than anyone else in the Biden admin.

I hope he faces consequences for what he has done to these families, along with the judges that handed down extremely unfair sentences.

Founded in 1985 through the merger of Houston Natural Gas and Internorth, Enron quickly grew into a major energy-trading company. Under CEO Kenneth Lay, the company reached #7 on Fortune's list of the top 500 U.S. companies by 2000, employing 21,000 people and generating $111 billion in revenue. However, by the end of the year, Enron‚Äôs stock price had plummeted from $90.75 in August to just $0.26 by November. As the stock dropped, Lay sold off his shares while encouraging employees to buy more, leading many to lose their retirement savings. The company‚Äôs collapse was triggered when a planned $8.4 billion buyout by Dynegy fell through, and Enron filed for bankruptcy.

Enron‚Äôs fall was later linked to widespread accounting fraud, where it hid debts and losses through off-the-books partnerships. This prompted investigations by the SEC and Justice Department, revealing that Lay and CEO Jeffrey Skilling had conspired to mislead investors about the company‚Äôs financial health. The scandal also implicated Arthur Andersen, Enron‚Äôs auditor, which was found guilty of destroying incriminating documents. Although Andersen‚Äôs conviction was later overturned, the damage to its reputation led to the firm's downfall.

In 2004, Skilling and Lay were indicted and convicted on multiple charges, including fraud and insider trading. The trial saw former executives, including CFO Andrew Fastow, testify against Lay and Skilling. Fastow had pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and cooperated with prosecutors. Lay died of heart disease shortly after the verdict, leading to the dismissal of charges against him. Skilling, sentenced to over 24 years in prison, served about 12 years before his release in 2019.

Enron‚Äôs collapse cost billions, destroyed thousands of jobs, and became a symbol of corporate fraud, ultimately leading to stricter regulations like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.",en,Tweet,3,34,6,8,6246.0,2024-12-02 12:23:30,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdyxmD3XYAAycq3.jpg

Joe did not pardon Hunter because he is a father who loved his son like the mockingbird media and Democrat liars are saying.

Joe pardoned Hunter all the way back to 2014 when Hunter started bio labs in Ukraine, started with Burisma, and began money laundering through dozens of LLC shell companies through business deals in many foreign countries including China.

Hunter is not just Joe‚Äôs son, he is his business partner, and Hunter sold his Dad‚Äôs power and influence for millions while Joe was VP and beyond.

The good news? We were able to get a 2-year extension instead of a 5-year extension, leaving it to President Trump to fix it. 

I am confident that with @TulsiGabbard leading the charge against FISA Section 702 under the Trump administration, we will get reforms this time that stop the federal government from entrenching your Fourth Amendment rights.

More freedom.

I sympathize with a father who rightly believes his son has been targeted by a politically motivated prosecution.  And many prosecutors ‚Äì most are elected ‚Äì have political motives. But prosecutors don‚Äôt adjudicate guilt ‚Äì juries do, beyond a reasonable doubt, according to the law, and subject to appeal.  Hunter Biden made his mistakes, and he should have faced his consequences, with all the many protections our system provides.

We elected Joe Biden to put the country and the rule of law ahead of himself and his family.  When we rightly criticize Trump for pardoning Stone, Bannon, Flynn, Kushner, and his Jan 6 rioters, Republicans will now just reply that Biden pardoned Hunter. This is how the fragile norms that support our nation of laws change. The shoes are on both feet.

But listen up, Senators: If you don‚Äôt like presidential policies that put family and political cronies over country, you have the power to uphold the standard of law Americans have a right to expect. You may feel that Biden politized the justice system. Trump has explicitly said he will use that system to attack his political enemies.
