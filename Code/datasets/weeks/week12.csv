Today‚Äôs passage of the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes important wins for our troops and ensures our military has the necessary resources and support to defend our great nation.¬†Our men and women in uniform should know their first obligation is protecting our nation, not woke ideology. It‚Äôs disappointing to see 124 of my Democrat colleagues vote against our brave men and women in uniform over policies that have nothing to do with their intended mission.
¬†
That is why this year‚Äôs NDAA refocuses our military on its core mission of defending America. The legislation supports law enforcement operations and the deployment of the National Guard to the southwest border, expedites innovation and reduces the acquisition timeline for new weaponry, supports our allies, and strengthens our nuclear posture and missile defense programs.
¬†
Because we believe in peace through strength, we blocked the Biden Administration's plan to reduce the number of US special forces. We remain determined to confront increasingly hostile threats from Communist China, Russia, and Iran, and this legislation provides our military with the tools they need to deter our enemies and keep America safe.
¬†
We also believe it‚Äôs important to refocus the Pentagon on military lethality, not radical woke ideology. This legislation permanently bans transgender treatment for minors, prohibits critical race theory in military academies, ends the DEI bureaucracy, and combats antisemitism.
¬†
This legislation also reinforces our commitment to America‚Äôs brave men and women in uniform, and their families, by making landmark investments in their quality of life. I‚Äôm proud that we‚Äôre providing significant pay increases to our servicemembers, reducing barriers to employment for military spouses, and improving military housing and access to childcare.

Hussein had ruled Iraq for over two decades, using brutal tactics to maintain power, including chemical attacks on civilians and an eight-year war with Iran. His regime collapsed after the invasion, but Saddam went into hiding, leading to an extensive manhunt by U.S. forces.

The capture, codenamed ""Red Dawn,"" was the result of months of intelligence gathering and strategic interrogations. U.S. Army interrogator Eric Maddox played a pivotal role, relying on empathy to build trust with detainees, leading him to key informants who helped pinpoint Saddam's location. The operation was executed by a large military force but succeeded without firing a shot. Saddam was found hiding in a small hole near his hometown of Tikrit, disheveled but resigned to his fate.",en,Tweet,0,30,1,11,3923.0,2024-12-13 12:18:02,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GerZ1UfXsAAxO8M.jpg

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1867627216789811349',"Each week, we celebrate the remarkable stories of Hometown Heroes from across our district, individuals who rise up to inspire others. Today, we shine a spotlight on a truly extraordinary couple who have demonstrated resilience, strength, and unwavering hope in the face of unimaginable adversity‚Äîmeet this week's Hometown Heroes, Tony and Katie Ferrandino of Newtown.
 
For the Ferrandinos, life once seemed picture-perfect. Their son, Drew, was a vibrant child who filled their days with laughter and love. But on Drew‚Äôs third birthday, their world was forever changed when Drew experienced his first seizure. Over the next two years, they traveled across the country, sought out specialists, and refused to rest until they understood what was happening. At the age of five, Drew was diagnosed with Batten Disease (CLN2), a rare and devastating degenerative neurological condition‚Äîa disease for which there is no cure and is always fatal. For children like Drew, life expectancy is heartbreakingly short, with the disease robbing them of their ability to walk, talk, and even feed themselves. Yet, through it all, Drew‚Äôs spirit remained a beacon of light for his family.
 
Tragically, Drew passed away at just 12 years old on September 30, 2014. In the wake of such an indescribable loss, many would understandably be consumed by grief, but Drew and Katie Ferrandino chose a different path. Instead, they founded Drew‚Äôs Hope Research Foundation, dedicating their lives to funding research, advocating for new treatments, supporting other families, and spreading awareness about Batten Disease. What began as an act of love for their son has become a lifeline for countless families facing similar battles. Through Drew‚Äôs Hope, the Ferrandinos have supported over a dozen groundbreaking projects, including advancements in newborn screening, enzyme replacement therapies, and pioneering gene therapy. Each effort represents a step closer to a cure and a chance for children to have the futures they deserve.
 
The Ferrandinos exemplify what it means to rise above unimaginable hardship and channel grief into a force for good. Their work has not only propelled critical research but offered hope and support to countless families, ensuring no one faces this journey alone.
 
Tony and Katie, your courage, determination, and compassion embody the very essence of what it means to be a Hometown Hero. On behalf of our entire community, thank you for inspiring us, turning your pain into purpose, and ensuring that Drew‚Äôs light continues to shine brightly, illuminating the path toward hope and healing for generations to come.",en,Tweet,0,2,0,1,733.0,2024-12-13 17:46:41,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeslDVzXEAAt0wQ.jpg

Born in 1732 in Virginia, Washington began his military career in the Virginia militia during the French and Indian War. After the war, he returned to civilian life as a planter and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he became an outspoken critic of British policies toward the colonies. He was elected to the Continental Congress in 1774, and was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. Washington led the American forces to victory, culminating in the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781.

After the war, Washington retired to Mount Vernon but returned to public service to preside over the Constitutional Convention. The following year, he was unanimously elected the first president of the United States. He served two terms, stepping down in 1797 to retire once again.

After Washington‚Äôs death, Henry Lee famously eulogized him as ‚ÄúFirst in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.‚Äù",en,Tweet,0,81,15,4,4111.0,2024-12-14 11:54:49,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeweG1-XwAA5-iz.jpg

Without immediate relief, farmers may not be able to produce in 2025, nor even get banks to finance them. Many face the auction block sooner than many Americans would realize. Congress must prioritize these needs and deliver the support that will help agriculture stay afloat and continue to drive our economy forward and keep our food supply secure. We can do a lot in the next two years to eliminate the useless regulations that drive up costs to farmers and related businesses.

The Boston Tea Party was a protest against the British Parliament's Tea Act, which aimed to save the struggling East India Company by reducing its tax on tea and granting it a monopoly on the American tea trade. Although the Tea Act didn‚Äôt raise the price of tea, it allowed the company to undercut smuggled Dutch tea, which angered many colonists who saw it as another form of British control and ""taxation without representation.""

When the governor refused to allow the tea to be sent back to Britain, Samuel Adams organized the raid with the Sons of Liberty. The destruction of tea, valued at nearly $2 million today, prompted the British to pass the Coercive Acts (Intolerable Acts), which closed Boston's ports and imposed harsher British rule in Massachusetts. This led to the formation of the First Continental Congress, uniting the colonies in opposition to Britain.",en,Tweet,3,56,13,9,6554.0,2024-12-16 12:37:57,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ge67KN-XQAAZv6G.jpg

They thought after they went out in their blaze of glory that their face would be emblazoned in history as one who stood against all the horrors that they hated yet in reality, their body is barely cold and no one will remember them tomorrow except the families and friends who lost a loved one murdered in a hail of bullets that meant nothing. 

What a pathetic way to go out.

School shooters aren‚Äôt heroes. They don‚Äôt change anything. They don‚Äôt accomplish anything. They prove every abuser and hater in their life they are right, as they throw their life away murdering innocent people.

If you are someone who is trapped in nightmares that are reality, in loneliness that is deeper than the ocean‚Äôs darkest caverns, and surrounded by Satan‚Äôs henchmen abusing you in the deepest parts of your mind and soul, a school shooting will solve NOTHING. 

The shooting will steal your ability to fix it, change things, and be recognized as someone who made a difference.

Because you‚Äôll be dead. 

And tomorrow forgotten. 

We will only remember the victims.",en,Tweet,67,2357,348,546,245460.0,2024-12-17 03:54:17,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Orville piloted their gasoline-powered biplane, which flew for 12 seconds and covered 120 feet. The brothers made a total of four flights that day, with Orville and Wilbur alternately piloting the aircraft. The final flight, however, ended in a dramatic mishap. As the brothers were discussing the flight, a strong gust of wind flipped the Wright Flyer several times, causing severe damage. The aircraft was beyond repair, and it was crated and transported back to Dayton, never to fly again.

Over the following years, the Wright brothers continued to refine their aircraft. Their planes could perform complex maneuvers and stay aloft for 39 minutes. They made their first public flights in France and the U.S. Army purchased a plane. The brothers founded the Wright Company to build and market their aircraft.
