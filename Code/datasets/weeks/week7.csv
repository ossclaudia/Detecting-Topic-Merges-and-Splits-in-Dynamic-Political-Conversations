The election was a tumultuous process, starting with confusion on election night as networks first declared Florida for Gore, then for Bush, and back again, before Gore retracted his concession.

Despite Gore winning the popular vote by over 500,000 votes, the Electoral College ultimately decided the outcome. The recounts and legal challenges in Florida became a national spectacle, with terms like ""hanging chads"" and ""dimpled chads"" becoming widely recognized. The controversial butterfly ballot design in Florida, which led to misvotes, compounded the problem.

The recount process was marred by inconsistent standards and legal battles, culminating in a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court ruled 7-2 that the recount violated constitutional standards for consistency, and by a 5-4 vote, stopped the recount due to time constraints, effectively awarding Florida—and thus the presidency—to Bush.

The ruling, which divided along ideological lines, remains one of the most controversial in American history.

2. Energy Independence – Unlock domestic energy production to reduce costs and strengthen our economy.
3. Fair Trade – Protect American jobs by ensuring trade deals that prioritize U.S. workers.

Our state—and what we accomplished here—brings me hope.

We passed Proposition 1, enshrining equal rights in our state’s constitution. We built an unprecedented coordinated campaign—our state’s first-ever. Our team and volunteers knocked on 1.3 million doors, called 4.7 million voters, and turned out voters across the state’s seven battleground districts. We successfully defended all our Democratic incumbents in NY and flipped three seats blue. The New York State congressional delegation will send four more Democrats to Washington than the last Congress.

These victories make clear that New Yorkers believe in finding common sense solutions to the very real challenges we face, from getting costs down and wages up to keeping our communities safe.

We believe in fundamental truths like caring for our neighbors and treating others with kindness, decency and respect.

Noticing a glow from a nearby screen, he identified the unknown rays and named them X-rays. These electromagnetic waves, much shorter than visible light, could penetrate soft tissue but were blocked by denser materials like bone. Röntgen's discovery revolutionized medicine by allowing doctors to view the inside of the human body without surgery. X-rays were first used in military medicine during the Balkan War of 1897 to locate bullets and fractures.

Though initially seen as harmless, the dangers of X-ray radiation became apparent in the early 1900s after reports of burns and skin damage, and the death of Thomas Edison's assistant from cancer. Despite these risks, X-rays were used in various consumer products, like shoe-fitting fluoroscopes, until the 1950s, when their dangers were better understood. Röntgen, who received the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery, never patented X-rays. Today, X-ray technology is widely used in medicine, security, and materials testing.",en,Tweet,0,36,2,4,10075.0,2024-11-08 12:34:06,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gb3N3X_XgAAvD-n.jpg

Today, we honor the life and legacy of an extraordinary woman who touched countless lives in our community, a true Hometown Hero—Tina Marie Grady of Morrisville, whom we sadly lost a few weeks ago.

Tina’s life was a powerful testament to resilience, boundless compassion, and the extraordinary impact one person can have on the lives of others. Her 33 years of sobriety fueled her mission to become a beacon of hope and help for those struggling in our community. She was often the first to speak up and advocate for those facing addiction and mental health challenges, offering them unwavering support and reminding them that brighter days were possible. Tina provided invaluable hope and inspiration to so many, showing them they were never alone on their journey.

Her compassion for others shone most brightly through her passion for Christmas, a holiday she infused with purpose. She founded Evan’s Army Children Without  Parents, an organization named in honor of her late son, Evan, with the vision to bring the magic of Christmas to children who had lost a parent to addiction or suicide, ensuring they had the opportunity to experience the joy of Christmas morning—and she did just that. Just last year alone, Tina’s efforts brought Christmas joy to nearly 500 children, making sure that each of them felt loved and remembered.

Tina’s commitment did not stop with the holiday season. She worked year-round to ensure these children felt supported and valued, raising funds, gathering resources, and rallying the community to help them thrive. Under her leadership, Children Without Parents ~ Evan’s Army grew to become one of the largest toy drives and nonprofits in our area—a powerful testament to her tireless dedication and unbreakable spirit.

As co-chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Task Force, I had the profound honor of working alongside Tina and witnessing firsthand the incredible impact of her life’s work. Her passion for helping families and children affected by mental health and substance use crises went beyond dedication—it was a calling. Her warmth, compassion, and drive to make a difference inspired everyone who crossed her path, including me. 

Today, let us honor Tina’s memory by carrying her mission forward, remembering the love she brought to our community and the lives she changed for the better. Please join me in extending our condolences to Tina’s parents, Sam and Alison; her husband, William; her five children; her seven grandchildren; and all who loved her—she will never be forgotten, and her impact will be felt forever.",en,Tweet,0,7,1,2,932.0,2024-11-08 17:03:35,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gb4Lit4XMAEYAue.jpg

The next day, jubilant crowds began tearing the wall down. 

This marked the collapse of one of the Cold War's most infamous symbols, as the wall's destruction was quickly followed by souvenir hunters collecting pieces of rubble. The decision to open the wall was influenced by Hungary's recent move to open its border with Austria, allowing East Germans to bypass the Berlin Wall entirely and escape to the West. 

The fall of the wall also reflected broader political shifts in East Germany, where the communist regime was losing power and calls for democratic reforms grew louder. The event had a significant impact on U.S. President George Bush and his advisors, who, after watching the celebrations on television, grew more convinced that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s reformist stance was genuine. Unlike past Soviet crackdowns in Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968), Gorbachev supported the changes in East Germany, signaling a shift in Soviet policy.

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1855952978034737419',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1918, World War I ended when Germany, exhausted and on the brink of invasion, signed an armistice with the Allies in Compiégne, France.

The war’s roots trace back to June 28, 1914, when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb nationalist. This event escalated tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, with Austria-Hungary blaming the Serbian government for the attack. Russia, allied with Serbia, mobilized its forces, prompting Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. The conflict quickly spread as Germany supported Austria-Hungary, while France and Russia aligned against them. Germany's invasion of Belgium led to Britain declaring war on Germany.

The war, initially expected to be short, devolved into a brutal stalemate, especially on the Western Front, where trench warfare caused massive casualties. In 1915, the Allies tried to break the deadlock with a failed invasion of Turkey. By 1916, heavy offensives on the Western Front achieved no decisive results, though Germany had more success in the east, leading to a collapse of the Russian army and the Russian Revolution of 1917. By the end of 1917, the Bolsheviks had taken power and negotiated peace with Germany.

In 1918, the entry of American troops and resources tipped the balance in favor of the Allies. Germany, facing defeat, signed an armistice on November 11. The war, known as the “war to end all wars,” caused unimaginable destruction, resulting in about 9 million military deaths, 21 million wounded, and at least 5 million civilian casualties due to disease, starvation, and exposure. However, the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 imposed harsh terms on Germany, sowing the seeds for future conflict and leading to World War II.",en,Tweet,0,55,8,12,11452.0,2024-11-11 12:37:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcGrZMAW0AE5ih_.jpg

"Ellzey, Jake",Representative,Texas,6,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepEllzey,'1856063346933653612',"Veterans Day always makes me stop and think about the Privilege, Service, and Sacrifice of our veterans. Every service member has a unique story, but we all share one thing in common: the privilege of serving this great country. We raised our right hands, swore an oath, and gave a part of ourselves to defend and protect the freedoms we hold dear. And we did it willingly, knowing full well that service would ask a lot from us—and our families.

The sacrifices of military life are different for each person, but they’re no less real. For me, as a Navy guy, service meant long hours on the flight line, days spent getting ready for missions that would take me into the sky or out on the water. There were plenty of thrills, but there were also the long hours of prepping and debriefing, making sure every part of the aircraft was good to go, and taking care of the young sailors who worked hard to make it all happen. Every mission, every day, was a reminder that service isn’t just about the big moments—it’s about the daily grind and the commitment to something bigger than yourself.

Today is a day to say “thank you” to all those who served, who made it through and came back home to build their lives alongside the rest of us. For me, that means spending time with my wife and kids, enjoying the freedoms our veterans fought for and making up for some of the time I missed while I was standing watch.

So, if you see a veteran today, take a minute to thank them. For what they did, for who they defended, and for the country they served.",en,Tweet,0,17,3,2,758.0,2024-11-11 19:56:00,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcIPwqzXIAAe285.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcIPwqyXAAAeI4B.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcIPwqyXAAEx6rP.jpg"

The Gemini 12 mission, aimed at refining techniques for a lunar landing, involved Aldrin and James Lovell performing critical tasks like extravehicular activities (EVAs) and spacecraft docking.

During his spacewalk, Aldrin set up his camera on the hatch of the spacecraft, aiming it at himself and capturing a photo with Earth in the background. This marked the first self-portrait taken in space. Aldrin lifted his helmet visor to allow his face to appear in the shot, despite the challenges posed by the bulky spacesuit and zero-gravity environment.

This historic selfie was made possible by specialized space photography equipment, designed to withstand space's extreme conditions. Aldrin's achievement paved the way for future space selfies, with astronauts like Donald Pettit and Stephen Robinson continuing the trend in the 2000s.

That is a referendum on this Republican controlled Congress’s failed performance that did not excite the electorate to vote for House Republicans. 

We only hold the majority today because Trump drug the House across the line and Americans rejected the Democrat’s destructive America Last regime. 

Republicans in Congress who funded the Biden/Harris woke DEI, trans agenda, climate change hoax, weaponized DOJ & FBI, open border murderous and crime ridden policies, and funded Ukraine and other foreign wars only angered American voters and Trump’s historic landslide victory came from voters who are absolutely fed up with uniparty Washington DC politicians. 

Going forward the only agenda Republicans should passionately pursue, fund, legislate, and fight for is President Trump’s America First MAGA agenda. 

Republicans have been ordered by the American people that this agenda is the mandate. 

Democrats have been handed a harsh lesson that their sloppy nasty embrace of progressive, identity driven, America last policies will not be tolerated.
