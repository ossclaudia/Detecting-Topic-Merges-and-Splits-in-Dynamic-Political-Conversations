The Senate broke the House framework, and then they stomped all over it. Now, House leadership wants to cram this broken bill down our throats by rushing it to the floor while in the middle of discussions, completely disregarding their promises.

The only way of making this right is by leadership adhering to their commitments and restoring, at a minimum, these three important issues from the House version.

"Baumgartner, Michael",Representative,Washington,5,Republican,House: 2025-Present,Yes,RepBaumgartner,'1940775534201282739',"Latest update - the Big Beautiful Morning continues. Under House Rules, the Speaker, the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader are the 3 members who get special “magic minute” privileges to speak as long as they want on a Bill. D Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is currently using his “minute” to speak agains the OBBB and the expectation is that - similar to how Corey Booker got a little notoriety for setting the “filibuster” length of speaking record record in the Senate earlier this year - that Jeffries is attempting to beat the current 8hr House  record by R Kevin McCarthy. If so he’ll be speaking for about 3hrs more. It’s mainly just performative and he’s certainly telling a few fibs about the Bill, but it’s a fun part of the feisty American Congressional governance process in action. (It’s also a little therapeutic for many of the D’s who thought they’d beaten the Bill last night before the “Republican 4th Quarter Comeback”)  As the old saying goes: “The majority gets to decide what passes, the minority gets to decide how long it takes.”
As such, with some time on our hands, rather than watch Hakeem’s performance, I came back to the office to do a little work and may go hit up the House gym to shoot a few hoops while we wait. Also, some fun Washington state Congressional history in this video about the “ugly baby chicken painting” that gets handed down to new members of Congress from our state.

"Clyde, Andrew S.",Representative,Georgia,9,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,Rep_Clyde,'1940778247303626800',"I fully support President Trump’s agenda, 100%. Throughout this process, I have fought to improve the One Big Beautiful Bill in order to deliver as many conservative and fiscally responsible wins for the American people as possible.

As an ardent defender of our Second Amendment liberties, I’ve also fought to use this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore our constitutional freedoms through budget reconciliation. While the current bill removes NFA taxes on suppressors and short-barreled firearms, it falls short of eliminating the registration of the tax because the unelected Senate parliamentarian erroneously deemed the provision violated the Byrd Rule. 

That’s why I offered a commonsense amendment to repeal the NFA registration for suppressors and short-barreled firearms. Unfortunately, my pro-2A amendment was not made in order — meaning it never received a vote in committee or on the House floor. Therefore, I initially made it known that I would vote against the rule (a procedural vote), hoping to have the opportunity to amend it to restore our Second Amendment freedoms.

I also had the opportunity to discuss this critical matter directly with President Trump at the White House. I look forward to working with him and his Administration to further restore our 2A rights. Stay tuned.

When additional 2A changes in the OBBB were not obtainable, I modified my vote on the rule to YES in order to advance historic tax cuts, spending cuts, border security, job creation, and massive deregulation, as well as the removal of the draconian NFA’s foundation by eliminating the unconstitutional taxation on suppressors and short-barreled firearms.

I vowed to fight until the very end — and I meant it. Bottom line, we need more pro-2A champions in Congress, not just anti-gun control Republicans. Rest assured, I will keep fighting through all avenues — pushing legislative solutions here in Congress, advocating for executive actions, and supporting challenges in court — until the 91-year-old infringement of NFA registration is gone for good.

I will also be voting YES on final passage, because I support fulfilling President Trump’s America First agenda and the promises we made to the country. I look forward to President Trump signing the One Big Beautiful Bill into law so we can deliver a safer, stronger, and more prosperous America.",en,Tweet,192,4940,582,1086,477110.0,2025-07-03 15:22:46,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Like Jefferson, he expanded America’s horizons by pursuing new frontiers and breaking away from deep state tyrants.

Under this legislation, states can no longer expect federal taxpayers to foot the bill for illegal immigrants on Medicaid. If they choose to cover those costs, they’ll have to do so without federal support.

Despite the rhetoric, no one who is eligible for Medicaid will lose coverage—period. The OBBB protects the long-term integrity of the program and ensures it serves seniors, low-income families, and the disabled.

And to strengthen care in underserved communities, we’re also investing $50 billion to support rural hospitals and ensure continued access to care across the country.

Multiple spending issues have now been addressed, and with that, I am confident that we can move forward to ensure that this historic piece of legislation will have a lasting impact for future generations. 

While the bill is not perfect, there are significant conservative wins the House Freedom Caucus has achieved, including, among other things, securing nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid savings. 

HFC moved the bill dramatically to the right on almost every front and at every stage of the process, including overnight, as a small group of us continued working with the White House to address critical policy and spending issues. 

President John F. Kennedy said, “We do these things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” In this case, “these things” were hard-fought with a man whom I voted for and for whom I have tremendous respect—President Donald J. Trump.

"Rutherford, John H.",Representative,Florida,5,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepRutherfordFL,'1940840114743398792',"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act will give Americans a much-needed tax break and refocus our country on delivering on the promises made by President Trump for the American people like permanently closing the Southern Border, boosting our economy, offering historic tax relief for seniors, and revolutionizing our national security. This legislation also strengthens Medicaid solvency by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse to help vulnerable Americans who need it most.

Contrary to what you may have heard, this is not a huge deficit bill. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has scored this bill incorrectly, just as they did in 2017 by underestimating revenues from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by over $100 billion. They were wrong then, so why would we trust them now?

It’s time to get our country back on track. That’s why I was proud to pass this historic legislation to:

✅Boost our economy
✅Make President Trump’s tax cuts permanent
✅Focus resources on permanently closing the Southern Border
✅Provide funding to small, rural, and Medicare-dependent hospitals, rural health clinics, community mental health centers, opioid treatment programs, and more
✅Strengthen Medicaid solvency for those who truly need it
✅Incentivize Made-In-America cars and manufacturing
✅End taxes on tips and overtime pay
✅Slash taxes on Social Security, offering historic tax relief to seniors
✅Increase the Child Tax Credit
✅Secure more than a trillion dollars in mandatory savings
✅Cap SALT deductions
✅Modernize America’s Air Traffic Control systems to ensure safe and efficient air travel
✅Unleash American energy dominance
✅Cut Green New Deal policies
✅Revolutionize national security and America’s maritime dominance

"Miller, Mary E.",Representative,Illinois,15,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMaryMiller,'1940840862461870221',"BREAKING: Rep. Miller Votes to Pass the One Big, Beautiful Bill

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Congresswoman Mary Miller (IL-15) issued the following statement after voting in favor of H.R. 1, the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act:

“The One Big, Beautiful Bill is a once-in-a-generation victory for the American people,” said Congresswoman Mary Miller. “It delivers on President Trump’s America First agenda with bold, decisive, and immediate action. This is the most pro-worker, pro-family, pro-America legislation I have voted for during my time in Congress, and I was proud to help get it across the finish line for the hardworking Americans across my district.”

The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act is a historic victory for American workers, families, and farmers. It eliminates taxes on tips and overtime, delivers permanent tax relief for small businesses and working families, and expands critical support for American agriculture.

This bill fulfills President Trump’s America First agenda by securing the border, funding mass deportations, and ending radical “Green” New Scam tax subsidies. It unleashes American energy, strengthens our military, and protects federal benefits like SNAP and Medicaid, ensuring these vital programs serve American citizens, not illegal aliens. Every single Democrat in the House of Representatives voted against this bill.

As a member of the House Committee on Agriculture, Congresswoman Miller successfully fought to include her provision in the bill to strip illegal immigrants from receiving taxpayer-funded SNAP benefits. This common-sense reform passed the House and is headed to the President’s desk to become law. 

Additionally, Congresswoman Miller led the charge to defend life, securing a major pro-life victory by defunding Planned Parenthood and cutting off federal funding to the abusive, profit-driven abortion giant.",en,Tweet,11,1074,150,94,13231.0,2025-07-03 19:31:35,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gu8-sNwXIAAC-xg.jpg

"Roy, Chip",Representative,Texas,21,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepChipRoy,'1940840957055828412',"🚨Rep. Roy Statement on Passage of The One Big Beautiful Bill Act:

“Today, after a long day-and-night working hard to secure key wins from the administration to end the damaging Green New Scam subsidies, lock in substantial additional reductions in spending, and further assurances on how Medicaid will go to vulnerable Americans and not illegal aliens – I voted to support the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

For the last six months, we worked to guide the reconciliation process in the House to multiple wins in close coordination with President Trump’s team. At each step in the process – passing the budget resolution twice, passing the reconciliation package twice, and working in the Rules and Budget committees – the House Freedom Caucus worked with the President to force Congress to deliver substantial victories.

When we started this process:
• We were told “We can save maybe $300 billion.” House conservatives secured $1.6 trillion in legitimate savings.

• We were told “We cannot touch Medicaid.” House conservatives secured over $1 trillion in Medicaid and Obamacare reforms, established work requirements, and nearly returned Medicaid to pre-Biden spending levels.

• We were told “We cannot touch SNAP/Food Stamps.” House conservatives secured over $100 billion in savings, ensuring it goes to citizens over illegal aliens.

• We were told “We should temper expectations on repealing the Green New Scam.” House conservatives secured the termination of 90% of future ""Green New Scam"" projects, solidified by assurances from the President last night, saving over $500 billion.

• We were told “We cannot do anything for Health Savings Accounts.” House conservatives secured their use for Direct Primary Care, making them much more effective for hard-working Americans seeking choice in a broken healthcare system.

The swamp – in Congress and on K Street – tried to stop the President and those of us fighting to deliver substantial spending reductions and reforms at each and every step of the way. We won fights they said we could not win. 

We added significant resources to secure the border. We have extended tax relief for millions of Americans. We have passed the largest “mandatory” spending reduction in American history. We have terminated about half of Joe Biden’s signature accomplishment, the “Green New Scam.”

Celebrate today. Fight again tomorrow.”",en,Tweet,108,3904,771,613,132583.0,2025-07-03 19:31:57,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

This bill gives President Trump the tools he needs to finish securing the border by providing $175 billion in new funding. It will allow for completion of the border wall, fund ICE deportation efforts, and hire and train new border patrol agents.
 
Common sense will prevail in many other instances throughout this package. It defunds Planned Parenthood abortion mills and eliminates the unconstitutional tax on short-barreled firearms and suppressors. Sadly, one provision the Senate removed was a prohibition on taxpayer dollars for transgender surgeries. 
 
While this bill isn’t perfect, I’m proud of my fellow conservatives for negotiating hard to ultimately achieve a bill with the largest cost-savings in our nation’s history. Key provisions such as removing illegal aliens from welfare programs, capping student loan programs, and instituting basic work requirements for able-bodied adults are an important step in the right direction. The bill would have been even stronger had the Senate not weakened several other fiscal reforms in the House version that would have done better by the taxpayers who are already on the hook for $37 trillion in debt.
 
I recognize to undo the damage done to our country by radical progressive Democrats, Congress must authorize the funds to accomplish that goal.  However, I fear that if Washington’s overspending addiction continues, the opportunity to put our country back on a path to a sound financial future is in jeopardy. In the coming months, Republicans must use every tool at our disposal to rein in government spending.

This package delivers a lot of what we’ve been pushing for years. It means more jobs and a stronger economy, with tax relief that lets working families and seniors keep more of what they earn. It makes Social Security checks tax-free for most seniors, protects Medicare, and makes sure tips and overtime pay aren’t taxed. The median family in our district will save around $3,500 under this bill.

It also invests $1 billion to fix canals and expand water storage, so we can actually hold onto water during wet years instead of watching it wash out to sea. It opens up more of our country for energy and timber production and strengthens crop insurance. There’s also a new $50 billion fund to keep rural hospitals afloat as states change Medicaid formulas, so people don’t lose care close to home.

It puts real resources into securing the border so we can finally finish the wall, hire more Border Patrol and ICE agents, remove criminal illegal aliens, and get this crisis under control. It also gets us back to the principle that if you’re a healthy, able-bodied adult, you should be working.

I am honored to serve and deliver for the state we love:

☑️Unlocking our resources. Mandatory lease sales open 1.6 million acres in ANWR, 20 million acres in the NPR-A, and 6 million acres in Cook Inlet - more than 30 million acres in total, almost the size of the entire state of Florida! Alaska will receive a greater share of federal royalties than ever before, growing the Permanent Fund and keeping PFDs strong for decades.

☑️Putting money back in your pocket. Overtime and tips are now tax-free, small-business depreciation is immediate, and the Trump tax cuts are made permanent so families can save, and businesses can hire. Further, there are even additional deductions for seniors on Social Security.

☑️Securing the border. More than $100 billion in new resources equips Border Patrol agents and delivers advanced technology to help stop fentanyl before it reaches Alaska’s towns and villages.

☑️Investing in safety. The single largest Coast Guard appropriation in U.S. history funds 16 new Arctic-class icebreakers and major port upgrades, while $12.5 billion modernizes Air Traffic Control. This bill protects mariners, pilots, and every community that depends on them.

☑️Protecting care where it is needed. Medicaid integrity reforms guarantee help for the truly vulnerable, and new rural-hospital funding helps keep all Alaskans healthy.

This legislation fulfills our longstanding goal: Alaska charting its own course, creating good-paying jobs today, and providing opportunity for generations to come.

This legislation addresses many of the legislative priorities that President Trump promised to Americans during his campaign for President. Although the bill is not perfect, as none are, nor does it include several provisions of the original House version, I voted in favor of the largest tax cut in history, ending the Biden-era invasion of our southern border, and reducing wasteful and abusive spending of taxpayer dollars. 
 
Americans are tired of having a government that they are afraid of, and want a government they can be proud of. This Reconciliation package scales back the size and scope of federal agencies, cuts red-tape, brings more accountability, and cuts fraud, waste, and abuse. This bill is a good start, but Congress still has a lot of work to do; as we must continue to move back to a government that is small in size, limited in scope, and dedicated to preserving the rights and liberties of the American people.
 
Last November, voters gave the President and Congress an unprecedented mandate to govern, and to tackle the very challenges that this bill addresses.

"Kean, Thomas H.",Representative,New Jersey,7,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,CongressmanKean,'1940842187383529477',"This afternoon, Congress passed a commonsense legislative package that was a major win for New Jerseyans and Americans across the country. We secured the full SALT deduction for every middle-class family in New Jersey. I never backed down from the fight for SALT relief, standing up to Democrats and Republicans alike to quadruple the deduction to $40,000. I also stood with American innovators, voting to renew R&D tax credits for the research and development that businesses do to fuel ingenuity and job creation.

I voted to safeguard Medicaid for every intended beneficiary in the Garden State and nationwide. By rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, we are preserving this vital program for today’s recipients and future generations. I also voted to protect New Jersey’s expansion of certain critical supplemental payments they receive from the federal government—an important financing tool that hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care providers rely on to serve Medicaid patients. Finally, this bill allocates $50 billion over five years to hospitals and health care providers, ensuring patients continue to receive quality care in New Jersey and throughout the country.

We permanently increased the Child Tax Credit to $2,200, delivering meaningful relief to young families still struggling under the weight of four years of record inflation. We secured necessary resources for Somerset and Morris Counties, and the entire state, by investing tens of millions of dollars in local and state law enforcement to better equip them to protect President Trump and surrounding communities.

We made significant progress on key priorities like securing the border, unleashing American energy and advancement, and strengthening national security—all while cutting wasteful spending, advancing affordability, and making the federal government both more efficient and more accountable.

Once President Trump signs this bill into law, life will become more affordable for residents of New Jersey’s Seventh District.

"Scott, Robert C. ""Bobby""",Representative,Virginia,3,Democratic,House: 1993-Present,Yes,BobbyScott,'1940842190436962798',"Once again, Republicans rushed to jam their Big, Ugly Bill through Congress. Their bill will have serious consequences for America’s working families. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that 17 million people will lose their health insurance, including over 322,000 Virginians. It will make college less affordable.  Three million people will lose access to food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). And up to 16 million students could lose access to free school meals. The Republican bill does all of this to fund tax breaks for millionaires, billionaires and corporations. And it makes annual deficits and the national debt worse than they would be if we did nothing.
 
For years, we have heard Congressional Republicans preach about fiscal responsibility and complain about deficits and the national debt. Yet they just voted for a bill that will add an estimated 3.4 trillion dollars to our deficit and that does not even include the cost of interest. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, because every Republican administration since President Nixon has left for their Democratic successors a worse budget deficit than the one they inherited. And every Democratic administration since President Kennedy has left for their Republican successors a better deficit situation than the one they inherited. All without exception.
 
This bill is a collection of policies that will harm America’s working families, bestow tax breaks on the wealthy, and significantly increase the national debt.

This year, we had a real opportunity to pass a budget that put the middle class first. The reality of slim majorities in both chambers of Congress should have created an incentive to work across the aisle. The parties could have worked together to extend middle-class tax cuts without giveaways to corporations and the wealthy. We could have built on the success of $35 insulin and Medicare drug price negotiations to make health care more affordable. We could have reduced the deficit — something both parties agree should be a priority.

Instead, from the very beginning, this GOP majority has used a broken, partisan process where the only choices put on the floor seemed to be ‘bad’ or ‘worse.’

As a result, we have a law that will take health care away from tens of thousands of Mainers, close rural hospitals across the country, and blow up the national debt — all to pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit those at the top. While I am proud to join the entire Maine delegation in voting against this bill, the truth is Mainers will suffer because of this partisan, harmful budget.",en,Tweet,6,157,34,19,22799.0,2025-07-03 19:36:58,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

“Last November, Americans voted for change in Washington, D.C. Today, Congress is delivering much of the change promised by President Trump’s America First agenda that voters in our Second Congressional District chose by a large margin.

“We make America safer by funding permanent border security and the removal of illegal aliens from our country. We also strengthen and modernize our national defense.

“We make America more affordable by canceling an estimated $1,200 tax increase scheduled for hundreds of thousands of Kansans I represent. We make permanent key parts of the 2017 tax cuts that are helping middle-class Kansas families, including the expanded child tax credit, provisions supporting main street businesses, and the increased standard deduction used by more than 90% of Second District taxpayers. We add new tax relief for seniors, workers, and families, including no tax on tips, tax cuts on the purchase of American-made vehicles, and savings that offset taxes on Social Security for more than 80% of the seniors who receive benefits. We also provide stability and support for farmers and ranchers throughout our district by enacting critical parts of the long-overdue Farm Bill. These policies support growth and economic development throughout eastern and central Kansas.

“This bill also includes specific wins for Kansas that I fought for and supported, including provisions to protect Kansas hospitals and to support low-income housing, community banks, disabled people, students, and farmers. The people of the Second District will always be my first priority, and I will continue to work to strengthen services that meet Kansas needs.

“America is more than $36 trillion in debt and sinking further each year because federal spending keeps growing faster than revenues, which is why we are bending the curve of federal spending growth downward by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. By themselves, these savings are not enough to put America’s finances in order, but they’re a long overdue start and represent the first federal spending reduction in a generation. In the coming weeks, I’ll continue working to protect taxpayers and lower spending by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse throughout our government.

“Americans expect us to do what is necessary for our country even when it is hard. In our big and diverse country, enacting change requires compromise. This legislation contains some provisions I don’t support and omits others I favor, but its benefits to the Kansans I represent easily exceed its shortcomings. America cannot remain on our decades-long path toward insolvency and weakness, nor can we tax and spend our way to prosperity, strength, or a more free and secure future. The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ takes a first step toward putting our country back on track as I promised Kansans I would work hard to do, and for that reason it received my vote.”",en,Tweet,0,9,3,11,618.0,2025-07-03 19:37:19,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

"Perez, Marie Gluesenkamp",Representative,Washington,3,Democratic,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMGP,'1940844510977593543',"I just voted NO on a partisan reconciliation bill ⬇️

Most of us want honest debate, compromise, and bipartisanship – not party favors for special interests and political parties. But D.C. is way out of balance when only one party has control, and we all suffer for it.

Congress had a chance to level the playing field for everyday people and small businesses – by cutting red tape, building national health, and unleashing low-cost energy. Instead, the Majority made the terrain more uneven.

I repeatedly joined fellow @HouseBlueDogs to offer our help crafting a fiscally-responsible proposal that provides tax relief for middle class families in #WA03 – but unfortunately the Speaker showed no appetite for bipartisanship.

Under this bill, everyday families will come out in the negative, while Wall Street reaps the real benefits. The top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would receive an average handout of $118,630 a year – while the bottom 20 percent lose $560 a year.

Plus, it’s one of the largest explosions of our debt ever from a single bill. A $4 trillion debt increase might just seem like another number on paper to politicians in D.C. – but that amounts to $31,000 in spending for every U.S. household.

It’s unsustainable to pass that burden of debt on to our kids.

Not to mention, our soaring national debt will worsen inflation and interest rates – while the bill drives up costs on energy, food, and healthcare premiums.

This legislation also will strip healthcare away from 17 million Americans – which is more than twice the total population of our state.

That’s 31,000 people in #WA03 who stand to lose healthcare – and rural hospitals across Southwest Washington are expected to lose tens of millions of dollars, which could put these lifelines at risk of collapse.

This doesn’t only affect those on Medicaid – when rural hospitals suffer, the health of rural communities like mine suffers.

Our community health centers and our corrections officers also pay the price when we gut Medicaid. I’ve heard from them how cuts like these will make their work even more difficult fighting our fentanyl and mental health crises on the front lines.

I refuse to defend bureaucratic inefficiency – and we need to aggressively root out waste, fraud, and abuse in our federal programs.

It’s why I recently voted against a bill that would defund our federal auditing watchdog by 50 percent. But suffocating hardworking citizens, seniors, and people with disabilities with more convoluted forms to fill out isn’t how we do it.

This bill has become so big and bloated that my colleagues have lost the plot. It’s grown detached from the President’s original promises to balance the budget, not touch Medicaid, and close the carried interest loophole, a measure I’ve led.

It was pushed through with budget gimmicks that disrespect the intelligence of my community, despite bipartisan opposition – and it was designed to shirk responsibility, with many of these harmful provisions only going into effect after the midterm elections.

It’s a shame that this bill passed the House by the slimmest of margins – and I’ll be working in the coming weeks to support our communities as we face the impacts of this reckless legislation.",en,Tweet,7,178,25,14,11613.0,2025-07-03 19:46:05,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

“After months of hard work and thoughtful deliberation, I was proud to vote for the One Big, Beautiful Bill and help send it to President Trump’s desk. This includes much-needed tax relief for the American people. This bill delivers the largest tax cut in American history for workers, families, and seniors by ending taxes on tips and overtime for millions of workers and slashing taxes on Social Security. It also makes a generational investment in Rural America by expanding crop insurance, strengthening biosecurity measures, and boosting investment in the farm safety net, and it prevents a Death Tax increase that would devastate thousands of family farms in Indiana’s Fourth Congressional District. On top of these monumental wins, the One Big Beautiful Bill invests in our border security to deliver the most secure border on record and delivers on President Trump’s successful foreign policy of peace through strength.
 
“There has been a lot of misleading information on this bill. This legislation strengthens federal programs for those who truly need them and enacts common-sense work requirements that a majority of Americans support. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score assumes an incorrect baseline that simply does not reflect current policy. In reality, the One Big Beautiful Bill reduces the deficit, marking a long-overdue return to fiscal sanity in Washington.
 
“This bill ultimately fulfills many of the promises made to the American people. As we celebrate Independence Day and the birth of our nation, I am pleased to deliver these significant wins that ensure America truly remains the greatest country in history.”",en,Tweet,0,14,3,20,1544.0,2025-07-03 19:47:48,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

The One Big Beautiful Bill will help Americans across all walks of life by making tax cuts permanent and increasing take home pay as much as $7,500 through provisions such as no tax on tips and no tax on overtime. 

Additionally, by increasing tax breaks for seniors, strengthening the child tax credit for families, making made-in-America car loan interest tax deductible, and addressing inflation with the largest mandatory spending reduction ever, the Big Beautiful Bill will make everyday life more affordable.

Importantly, this bill makes significant progress to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse from both SNAP and Medicaid by implementing work requirements for able-bodied individuals without dependents. These common sense reforms will preserve these important safety net programs for those who need it most — namely, low-income mothers, children, the elderly, and disabled Americans. 

The One Big Beautiful Bill will supercharge Michigan’s economy by boosting manufacturing, helping farmers, modernizing our military, and unleashing American energy. 

Lastly, the One Big Beautiful Bill provides critical resources to ensure our border remains secure by finishing the wall and ensuring we have the law enforcement manpower we need to keep our nation safe.

Congressman Patronis: Congress Delivered a Big, Beautiful Victory for America
 
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Jimmy Patronis issued a statement on the second and final passage of H.R. 1 – One, Big Beautiful Bill Act. President Donald J. Trump is expected to sign the One, Big, Beautiful Bill on the Fourth of July.
 
Congressman Jimmy Patronis said, “With the final passage of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill, Congress has delivered a historic win for the American people. Thanks to the leadership of Speaker Johnson and President Trump, this legislation will extend and make permanent many of the Trump Tax Cuts, reignite America’s economy, and restore the American dream for working families. This bill has lots to love, but as tourism is a huge economic driver for our region, no taxes on tips will benefit families all throughout the Panhandle. It also secures the border by providing $175 billion, the largest border security investment in history. Also, the bill provides important funding for Coast Guard readiness and increases American military superiority around the world. The Democrats who voted no for this bill supported cutting the Child Tax Credit in half and increasing taxes for the average American by 22 percent. I was proud to vote alongside the majority of my Republican colleagues to ensure that Floridians and small businesses in my district experience lower taxes, higher wages, and safer communities. I look forward to President Trump signing the One, Big, Beautiful Bill into law and making America wealthy, safe, proud, and great again!”
 
One, Big, Beautiful Bill Wins:
 
•Makes Trump Tax Cuts Permanent. Saves Americans from a 22% tax increase.

•Makes Child Tax Credit Permanent. Prevents the Child Tax Credit from being cut in half.

•Bolsters our military and national security. Provides $150 billion to modernize the military.

•Secures our Southern Border. Makes historic investments to finish the Border Wall.

•No tax on tips. Raises real wages for every American worker.

•No tax on overtime. 100 percent elimination of overtime taxes for over 80 million workers.

•Tax relief for seniors. Middle and low-income seniors will be able to deduct an additional $6,000.

After a long night working with the White House and leadership, I voted yes to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill after I was convinced our efforts would result in the best possible outcome.

We had major concerns going into this week after the Senate reversed several conservative provisions we fought for in the House version of the bill, including major deficit and spending cuts and priorities like ending the Green New Scam. 

Some of these changes were created by the parliamentarian, others were not. These changes were of grave concern to me. 

While today’s bill is not perfect, after days of prayerful consideration and examination of the facts, I ultimately came to the conclusion it was the best bill we could politically achieve after meeting with the President, the Vice President, and their team. The explanation of the problem of going back to the Senate for further changes—and how that would have only made the bill worse because the liberals of the conference would extract more liberal concessions, not conservative concessions—resonated with me.  

The @freedomcaucus fought to make this bill better at every stage—and we succeeded. We secured transformational wins for fiscal responsibility, border security, energy independence, welfare reform, and tax relief.

""It's been sickening to see Republicans fast track a bill that's not just bad policy, it's reckless and selfish, and it's a betrayal to our people. 

This bill would rip lifesaving Medicaid coverage from 17 million Americans, including 150,000 in Hawai‘i, and take food out of the mouths of 42 million people who rely on SNAP to feed their families, including 22,000 right here at home. 

It guts the income our farmers and grocers depend on to nourish our communities, all while handing billions in tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy. 

These aren’t handouts, they’re lifelines. 

And the cruelest part? Our keiki will be stuck paying off the $5 trillion in debt this bill creates.

To push this through on the eve of our nation’s birthday isn’t just heartless — it’s anti-American. It’s wrong, and Hawai‘i and our country deserves better.

Cuts back on the provider tax money laundering scheme.
Implements protections to keep illegal immigrants from receiving Medicaid.

While we still have work to do to correct course on Congress's spending addiction, this bill enacts the largest mandatory spending reforms in history—it's a big start. This bill also includes conservative reforms that the pundit class said would be impossible to pass just weeks ago.

And while it may seem at home that there was a delay in bill passage, I will note that it was only 40 hours from passage of the Senate bill to passage of the rule in the House (signifying conference agreement). This time was used—in addition to traveling to D.C.—working through the night to evaluate the last-minute changes by the Senate and working with President Trump and his team to ensure the changes would not hamstring his agenda. We were also able to secure an agreement from Speaker Johnson that before September 30th, we will vote on a Balanced Budget Amendment.

Of course, we still have challenges ahead—especially in continuing to enact the fiscal reforms necessary to preserve the liberties and prosperity we have inherited for our kids and grandchildren. But this is a significant first step in reforming spending and a great step in advancing President Trump's agenda as together we work to Make America Great Again!",en,Tweet,2,75,11,20,1932.0,2025-07-03 21:26:42,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

A proud graduate of UC Davis, he always understood the importance of education and gave back generously whether through his support of Fresno State’s Maddy Institute or mentoring the next generation of agricultural leaders.

John was a pioneer in the development and production of healthy food products that made the Harris Ranch Beef one of the most respected food producers in America. His love of horses and agriculture defined his life. 

I had the good fortune to know John for over 40 years - he was my friend; he will be deeply missed, but his legacy will live on forever.

The OBBB is about keeping promises — the promises President Trump and every MAGA Republican made to the American people. Today, House Republicans delivered.

The OBBB makes the Trump Tax Cuts permanent, protecting families and small businesses from the largest tax hike in American history. It moves to eliminate the unfair death tax that punishes family farms and generational businesses with double taxation. And it ensures hardworking Americans keep more of what they earn by ending taxes on tips and overtime.

It also secures the border by fully restoring President Trump’s successful immigration policies and funding:

✅ At least 1 million deportations per year

✅ 10,000 new ICE agents

✅ 3,000 new Border Patrol agents

✅ And completing President Trump’s big, beautiful wall

It makes our nation sicker, hungrier and financially feebler, and all to fatten the bulging wallets of the wealthy and big corporations. It will close hospitals, kill construction jobs, hike electric bills, shutter nursing homes, kick 17 million off health care coverage, and make life harder for countless children, seniors, and veterans.

These are hard facts confirmed by independent experts like the Congressional Budget Office.

The more that people learn about this bill – needlessly rammed through, with too little debate, mostly while America slept – the less popular it becomes. Its main theme, stealing healthcare and food from paycheck-to-paycheck families just to funnel whopping tax break windfalls to the wealthy, is an obscenity. Its temporary crumbs of relief for workers are dwarfed by a feast of permanent benefits for the superrich.

But Democrats will not let its destructive roots choke America’s promise.

"Bera, Ami",Representative,California,6,Democratic,House: 2013-Present,Yes,RepBera,'1940897995454607462',"Read my full statement on today's vote: 

“As a doctor, I have seen firsthand what happens when people lose access to health care. Patients skip checkups and go without medications. Chronic conditions worsen, small problems turn into major health crises, and preventable illnesses become emergencies. But that’s exactly what Republicans just voted to do. Their bill makes deep cuts to Medicaid, putting health care at risk for millions of children, seniors, women, and people with disabilities. These cuts will force more people to delay care, crowd our emergency rooms, drive up hospital and pharmacy costs, and ultimately make health care more expensive for everyone. That is not just bad for families—it harms our entire health care system and weakens our economy.

“Part of the reason I first ran for Congress was to improve our health care system and protect patients. I’m proud of the work Democrats have done in recent years to expand coverage—helping millions of Americans gain access to care, lower out-of-pocket costs, and move us closer to universal coverage. But this bill reverses that progress, stripping health care from nearly 17 million Americans—including more than 2 million Californians—and putting some of the most vulnerable people in our communities at risk.

“As the son of immigrants, I know the value of hard work, opportunity, and a community that invests in its people. That is the American Dream—the belief that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can build a better life for you and your family. That’s why I’ve always believed in working across the aisle to support working- and middle-class Americans. But any honest conversation about tax policy must start with fairness. Corporations and the ultra-wealthy must pay their fair share. This bill isn’t about fiscal responsibility—it’s about locking in permanent tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy by extending Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. It adds $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, while shifting more of the burden onto working families who are already struggling to make ends meet.

“Although this bill now heads to President Trump’s desk, our work is far from over. I will continue to speak out against these harmful policies and fight for an agenda that protects health care and keeps the American Dream alive for working- and middle-class Americans.”

The Declaration of Independence was, in addition to an elegant expression of our highest ideals, a list of grievances - a litany of offenses committed by a tyrannical King.

Included among offenses that our Founding Fathers took issue with, were that the King had “made Judges dependent on his Will alone;” had “kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures;” had “affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power;” had “depriv[ed] us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury;” and had “excited domestic insurrections amongst us.”

Our country was founded in opposition to these injustices. In America we have no kings. The character of our country is not contingent on one leader. Despite his abuses and usurpations, the American people remain resilient and resolute. We care for one another, we stand up to bullies, and we fight for justice and equality.

May God bless you, and may God bless the United States.",en,Tweet,1,56,15,53,2761.0,2025-07-04 15:00:01,"<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web Client</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1938268259297394688/vid/avc1/3840x2160/fUt7ILGd7URvyxiu.mp4?tag=21

Yet we’ve witnessed Trump’s conduct mirror tyrannical behavior—assaults on basic liberties, attempts to weaken judicial independence, and claims of being above legal accountability while Republican enablers in Congress look the other way.

This Independence Day offers a moment to consider our fundamental principles and the consequences of failing to actively protect our democratic institutions. Throughout our nation’s most challenging periods, engaged citizens have restored America’s democratic path through civic participation, whether by voting, demonstrating peacefully, serving their communities, or supporting the causes they believe in most.

FALSE.

Plus, while the corporate tax cuts are permanent, this provision expires in 2028.

"Hinson, Ashley",Representative,Iowa,2,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepAshleyHinson,'1942595813307281767',".@WSJ editorial board clearly lays out the frequent misconceptions and lies that the Left continues to perpetuate about President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Worth the read - some key highlights below:

➡️ “The GOP bill also includes sensible measures such as asking states to check their Medicaid expansion rolls every six months…That is necessary because the Biden Administration waived millions onto health entitlements. The Paragon Institute estimates that 6.4 million people are enrolled in fully subsidized ObamaCare plans but don’t meet the eligibility criteria. Apparently this is what Democrats support.”

➡️ “More of those who rely on benefits for longer need to be working. The GOP bill would expand the current work requirement to cover more able-bodied adults…”

➡️“The law also tries to tighten up waivers that states have abused to eliminate the work rules. The other major change is asking states with high improper payment rates to have skin in the game and pick up a share of benefit costs [for SNAP], which are currently billed 100% to the federal taxpayer.”

➡️ “America is a generous society that cares for the vulnerable. But it should also be a land of opportunity, not a European welfare state.”",en,Tweet,5,51,25,22,13845.0,2025-07-08 15:45:08,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

The true “affront to the bipartisan appropriations process” was him refusing to put a single bipartisan Committee-passed FY25 appropriations bill on the floor last year as Majority Leader…not a SINGLE one. His disastrous decision and failure of leadership is what led to the full-year CR we’re operating under—and the rescissions package Congress is considering and he’s lamenting.

Now, as Minority Leader he’s trying to blow up the bipartisan FY26 process two days before the Senate Appropriations Committee’s first markup.  Moving forward with the bipartisan process is what is allows Congress to fulfill its constitutional role - moving these bills through committee and then across the floor.  Senator Schumer getting his way would be bad both for his own party in the short term and bad for our nation over the long term.

Senate Democrats interested in preserving Congress’ Article I powers and responsibilities should have pushed Schumer to bring our bipartisan products to the floor last year and should now reject this latest effort by Schumer to sabotage our opportunity to get the Senate working again.

I commend Commissioners: Alan Hall, Dave Darrow, and Bob McNamara, along with State Senator Lisa Baker, and Representative Jonathan Fritz. Their leadership and tireless efforts have been critical in responding to this crisis.

We saw 105 mph winds, golf-ball-sized hail, and massive trees uprooted — some over 150 years old — destroying homes and blocking roads. Thankfully, no serious injuries have been reported.

In conversations with former County Commissioner, Judy Hershel, I contacted the Red Cross early Friday morning, and their swift and outstanding response made a real difference, arriving within an hour to deliver food and support to our neighbors in need.

A special thank you to Ron Cieslak, and all the staff at Schneider’s Market at the Plaza. Their generosity in feeding and supporting the 300+ utility workers — providing water, Gatorade, hamburgers, and more, all at no charge — embodies the very best of Susquehanna County.

As we continue cleanup and power restoration efforts, my office remains fully engaged. We’re working with PEMA, FEMA, and local officials to secure disaster declarations and ensure resources get to those who need them most.

The U.S. State Department already gives Nuclear armed Israel over $3 Billion every single year. Nuclear armed Israel has nearly decimated Hamas in Gaza all by themselves. And we just successfully bombed Iran’s and wiped out Iran’s nuclear program for Nuclear armed Israel. Nuclear armed Israel’s national debt is under $400 Billion compared to our crippling national debt of $37 TRILLION. Nuclear armed Israel seems to have their defense and debt under control, so the American taxpayers should not be required to give Nuclear armed Israel another $500 million in our U.S. defense bill.

Jordan gets around $1.6 Billion from the U.S. State Department every year, why do we have to give them another $500 Million?

Taiwan gets $300 Million from the U.S. State Department every year, and received an additional $2 Billion was in the foreign aid supplemental passed last year. I think the American people can keep that $500 Million.

And I’m sorry and no offense to anyone, but the American people should not be spending $15 Million for HIV prevention educational activities in African nations. If everyone doesn’t know the activities they need to stop doing to prevent getting AIDS by now, well I don’t know what to tell you. Mainly, it’s not America’s financial responsibility to do that and the people getting rich off this need to get funding elsewhere. Call the rich philanthropists! The American people are broke!

And the same goes for the $118 million for Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid. What foreign country showed up to America and said here’s millions of dollars for GA/TN/NC after Hurricane Helene? What about after CA wildfires wiped out so many homes? Lahaina, did they get a foreign aid check? And not a peep from all our great foreign friends trying to throw money at us for the devastated families in Texas from the July 4th flood.

Over it!! We have a drug and mental health crisis and rent, bills and especially insurance is unaffordable for too many hardworking Americans to be sending extra millions and billions to foreign countries for foreign causes to foreign people.

The American people are kind and generous and can donate privately if they choose but should not be forced to do so!

And the quickest and easiest way to cut spending is to STOP FOREIGN AID!!!

P.S. 
Not giving another additional $500 Million to Nuclear armed Israel will not make us all anti-Semitic. 
Or Isolationist.

P.S.S. 
We don’t have to pay off Jordan with another $500 Million either.

P.S.S.S.
“But Marjorie China will take Taiwan!” (said hysterically)
They’ve been telling me that for 5 years now. 
No neocons. No war with China for you!
We should focus on our own manufacturing and stop being overly dependent on countries like Taiwan so we don’t have to pay to defend them.
