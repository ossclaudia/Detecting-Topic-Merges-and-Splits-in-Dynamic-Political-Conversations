Democrats had 4 years to deal with this issue and failed. The American people have given Republicans control of the White House, Senate and House. 

Republicans will use reconciliation to transform a broken border. 

We will:

✅ Hire more ICE agents to deport gang members and violent criminals.

✅ Create more bed space so we don’t have to release illegal aliens into the country.

✅ Finish the wall and invest in border security tech to secure a broken border.

✅ Help a beleaguered military and implement common sense energy policy. 

It will be paid for and it will be done quickly. 

I have never seen so many threats to our homeland as I do today. 200 Americans die each day due to fentanyl poisoning.

If we learned nothing else from the November 5th election, we learned the American people don’t want business as usual in Washington.

They want strong leaders who will stand up and say enough is enough.

I am standing up for my home state of South Carolina and every hardworking American fed up with Washington. 

We need a complete and total reset. A 30-day government shutdown is a good place to start. We can pick this back up after Trump is sworn into office.

Truthfully, a shutdown isn’t a shutdown. That’s a bs lie from the media and the establishment stoking fear in your face.

During a “government shutdown” the president has authority to prioritize spending; the Office of Management and Budget has a contingency plan to prioritize spending; and all mandatory spending is still funded (social security, veterans benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.).

I also have a bill called the Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2023. This bill would provide immediate stability by appropriating funding for 90 days at 99% of our current budget, with a gradual reduction of 1% per day thereafter.

It’s time to hold the line for our fellow country men and women, for our nation’s future and for future generations.

“I had serious concerns with the first CR introduced with the extraneous and questionable provisions that were jammed inside and which I simply could not support. Clearly, we need more transparency in our government. Because of the inaction by Senator Schumer and the Senate who refused to pass any appropriations bills this year, it has created this last-minute mess, holding needed disaster and agricultural relief hostage so the Democrats could obtain many questionable provisions. The new CR agreement - the American Relief Act - focused on the basics and was the first of many steps to change how Washington works. Unfortunately, Democrats have chosen to ignore the needs of the American people right before Christmas and the holiday season and caused the bill to fail.

Trump and Musk are holding the U.S. government hostage to personally improve their standing. Musk intervened to protect himself from a China provision that would hurt his business interests. And Trump insisted on raising the debt ceiling so that he would be able to make a massive tax cut for billionaires and CEOs as soon as he gets into office in 2025.

The real tragedy here is that House Republicans are going along with this every step of the way. They have decided to protect Elon Musk’s business interests around China instead of funding childhood cancer research or improving child welfare services. They are prioritizing billionaires over substance-use disorder treatment, 9/11 responder and survivor health funding, workforce development programming, and seniors’ health and wellness services.

This failed bill cuts critical funding that working families are counting on, raises prescription drug costs for hardworking American taxpayers, and makes it easier for CEOs and billionaires to ship jobs overseas.

More than anything we are facing a shutdown because of Mike Johnson’s refusal to pass appropriations bills and fund the government the way it’s supposed to be funded. We should not be getting to the point where we need a Continuing Resolution to avoid a shutdown.

We should pass normal appropriations bills. But the reason we are not passing appropriations bills is the same reason that Mike Johnson allowed Trump and Musk to force forward their own self-interested proposal: he kowtows to the extreme, far-right MAGA Republicans in his conference.

We have the votes to pass normal appropriations bills and that should be our next step. I am deeply concerned that Johnson will not bring the appropriations bills up because MAGA extremists control him.

I urge my colleagues across the aisle to find a bipartisan, common-sense compromise to keep our government funded responsibly.",en,Tweet,3,46,12,23,3032.0,2024-12-20 03:00:18,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Elvis had become a cultural icon with hits like “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Hound Dog,” and “Blue Suede Shoes,” making him the first true rock-and-roll star. Despite thousands of fans petitioning for his exemption, Presley chose to serve. After a brief deferment to finish his film *King Creole*, he was sworn in as an army private.

Presley completed basic training and was then stationed in Friedberg, Germany, where he served with the 32nd Tank Battalion, rising to the rank of sergeant. During his time overseas, he lived with his family and hosted frequent parties and jam sessions. It was at one of these gatherings that he met Priscilla Beaulieu, whom he would later marry.

However, the man that took a bullet to the face and won the presidential election with 312 electoral college votes, and the most votes of any Republican presidential candidate in history asked me to vote for it, so I did, gladly.

After Johnson completely failed us by not including us in the planning of this year end’s government funding and then dumped a 1,500 page CRomnibus on us Tuesday night with little time to read it and got caught, in his scheme with Schumer, McConnell, and Hakeem, by all the great American people here on X along with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, it was President Trump‘s team, our incoming Vice President JD Vance, and then President Trump himself that dove in, in the midnight hour, and came up with a CR that solves the debt ceiling problem for President Trump, and even more importantly, helped hurricane victims, farmers, and would keep the government open.

They shouldn’t have had to do that but they did.

After that CR failed last night, I can assure you nothing good is coming behind it.

But what is worse in my opinion is that we gave up a critical opportunity to unite and pass our own CR sending it to Senate with a powerful message to Schumer and the Dems that come hell or high water we are going to deliver for Pres Trump and the people who elected him. 

After this let it shut down.

Suspending the debt ceiling entirely at this point would allow Congress to add an unlimited amount of debt to our already $36 trillion national debt for two years, with no reforms to rein in reckless spending. 

Suspensions or increases to the debt limit must be paired with spending cuts. I look forward to working with President Trump to enact the steep spending cuts ($1 to $3 trillion) paired with a responsible debt ceiling increase — through reconciliation. 

If we are going to raise the debt ceiling it should be paired dollar for dollar with Trump’s agenda to ensure the Washington establishment can’t skirt the America First agenda and go back on a handshake deal (which they always do).

If I’ve learned one thing from my time in the House, it’s that members of Congress on both sides of the aisle cannot be trusted with a limitless credit card to spend American taxpayer dollars.

Steps on working class families,
 
Fails to lower prescription drug prices,

Walks away from #veterans,

Abandons our longstanding commitment to nutritional assistance programs for children,
 
Turns its back on community health centers designed to help those most in need like the elderly in our communities,
 
Disregards investments into #Medicaid for the sick,
 
Ignores opioid recovery, 
 
Walks away from the plight of pregnant and postpartum women struggling with addiction, 

Paves the way for pharmacy benefit managers to continue running amok, and, 

Benefits millionaires and billionaires.

Since then, we have requested an independent, thorough, credible, and transparent investigation into what happened that day to both better understand the circumstances of her death and ensure that if any laws were broken, those who were responsible are held to account.

This week, Ms. Eygi’s family came to D.C. to discuss the challenges they've faced and the questions they still have about what happened. The lack of answers they have received is unacceptable.

We call on Israel to complete their investigation and release their report on the cause of her death. Secretary Blinken must insist on the release of any Israeli investigation results.  We also continue to urge the U.S. Department of Justice to initiate an independent, U.S.-led investigation into Ms. Eygi’s death. If the Justice Department isn’t going to investigate, then the State Department should release their own findings and seek accountability.

Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government have exacerbated tensions in the West Bank with their promotion of rapid Israeli settlement expansion. This dangerous situation in the West Bank has claimed the lives of far too many civilians, including Ms. Eygi.

We applaud the sanctions that President Biden has imposed thus far on extremist Israeli settlers, including the settler organization Amana. Clearly, more must be done.  The policies of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government undermine the viability of a Palestinian state and Israel’s security, violate the rights of Palestinians living in the West Bank, and put the region at even greater risk of further destabilization.

Today, we shine a spotlight on a remarkable young lady whose vision and compassion demonstrate what it means to lead with purpose—meet this week’s Hometown Hero, Grace Arner of Holland.
 
Grace, a talented cellist, has undertaken an extraordinary mission to ensure every child, regardless of financial circumstances, can experience the transformative power of music. She understands music is more than notes; it’s a sanctuary, a form of self-expression, and a source of healing. For children facing stress, anxiety, or hardship, music can be a lifeline—a way to process emotions, find joy, and build confidence. Yet, she also knows the cost of instruments can make this dream unattainable for many families.
 
Driven by her determination to make a difference, as part of her Eagle Scout project, Grace has set out to collect and restore instruments to their former glory, opening the door for children in our community to unleash their creativity, experience the transformative joy of music, and build a foundation for a brighter future. In addition, she has partnered with the @CouncilRockSD Music Foundation, a remarkable organization dedicated to providing scholarships for aspiring musicians and ensuring instruments reach those in need. Through this partnership, Grace has committed any unused funds from her efforts to be donated to the foundation, amplifying her impact by creating even more opportunities for students to pursue their musical dreams and carry forward the rich tradition of music education within our community.
 
Her project will culminate with a benefit recital and final donation drive at Holland Middle School on January 31st, where she has invited the community to come together to be a part of her special initiative. Along with her fellow Scouts, Grace will share her talents in a recital that embodies the very spirit of her mission: turning passion into purpose and dreams into reality.
 
Join me in applauding Grace, whose compassion, vision, and determination remind us all of the power of one person’s actions to create ripples of hope and opportunity—her efforts are a profound gift to our children and an inspiration to our community.",en,Tweet,0,8,1,1,866.0,2024-12-20 17:09:53,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GfQfwdJWwAA1GgH.jpg

The reality is, Democrats know the debt limit fight is coming. Whether Republicans take on that fight today, 3 weeks from now, in March, or in June-it's right in front of us. If we do it before Trump takes office, we can take away Chuck Schumer's leverage.

We were in this mess because we didn’t complete the appropriations process. I've long advocated for reforming the budget process and returning to regular order. However, I supported the CR because it’s better than the original proposal and better than a government shutdown, which would only harm the American public and kneecap President Trump as he is about to take office.

This package also received my support because it addresses the immediate needs of Third District Arkansans and includes provisions I’ve advocated for. Under my Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee’s jurisdiction, there’s $122 million included in disaster assistance directly for Arkansans who are recovering and rebuilding from the devastating Memorial Day weekend storms. It also provides much-needed resources to Arkansas' agriculture industry dealing with crop loss, government overregulation, and high inflation. These are real-life deliverables for those I proudly represent that cannot be ignored.

A product of a military family, Patton graduated from West Point and competed in the 1912 Olympics as the first American pentathlete. He later served in WW1's Tank Corps, advocating for tank warfare. During WWII, he led successful campaigns, including the capture of Palermo, Sicily, in 1943, and the relief of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, using unconventional strategies.

Patton was known for his boldness and forceful leadership, famously stating, ""We herd sheep. We drive cattle. We lead people. Lead me, follow me, or get out of my way."" His bluntness and controversial behavior often put his career at risk, most notably when he slapped a soldier suffering from ""shell shock,"" leading to public backlash.

Our national debt will soon exceed the size of our economy. We have annual budget deficits totaling nearly $2 trillion and this year the federal government will spend more on interest payments to service our debt than we have spent on our own national defense.

"Cloud, Michael",Representative,Texas,27,Republican,House: 2018-Present,Yes,RepCloudTX,'1870515011262771259',"Reflections on the End of the 118th Congress and this past week:

Before my service in Congress, I am a husband, father, grateful American citizen, and voter. I could not have been more thankful for President Trump’s reelection, and I was thrilled to finally have a candidate worth being excited to vote for.

As many of you know, my faith is what motivates everything I do, including my service in Congress and my deep love for this country. Because of that, I truly believe God sparred President Trump’s life as an act of grace, giving us the opportunity to save America.

In President Trump, we finally have a Republican leader with a sense of strategy, leverage, and a vision for reforming the swamp. This, combined with the clear mandate of the election, should afford him broad latitude on policy and strategy.

However, the corrupt DC swamp continues to fight against the MAGA agenda, and Congress is structured in a way that inherently undermines it. That’s why we must have fighters in Congress who are willing to restructure the institution and challenge DC’s addiction to reckless spending so that President Trump’s agenda has lasting permanence.

When President Trump made it clear that he wanted to address the debt ceiling now—rather than waiting for the January/February reconciliation package many of us were working on—the answer for myself and many others who consistently oppose debt ceiling increases was, if the President wants it, then yes. We understood and respected President Trump’s strategic leverage play. The only remaining question was: How?

As I made clear to the Speaker in his office, I trust President Trump and his team. But I do not trust Congress—a body that has long been willing to raise the debt ceiling without delivering reforms. I, along with others, sought a commitment from fellow Republicans to ensure we would follow through on Trump’s much-needed spending reforms when the time came.

While we made significant progress, ultimately, we were unable to secure this commitment in the few hours we had to work before the vote.

Adding to the problem was the fact that we had an agreement from Speaker Johnson to pass the CR as single-subject bills which he retracted on after meeting with Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries behind closed doors. This led to more House Democrats voting for the CR than Republicans.

The chaos of this past week was both predictable and avoidable. Weeks ago, I and others warned of these pinch points and urged leadership to involve members in crafting solutions. Unfortunately, we were ignored and locked out of the process. It wasn’t the rank-and-file members who failed this week—it was a failure of leadership that brought us here.

Come January, we will need to revisit how Congress operates to ensure it is structured to deliver President Trump’s MAGA agenda. Whether that requires personnel changes, process reforms, or both will be a critical discussion we must have.

May God bless you and your family this Christmas season. I look forward to January 20th and the beginning of a renewed American Renaissance.",en,Tweet,22,871,213,164,90280.0,2024-12-21 17:01:45,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1871533979578360051',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1814, the Treaty of Ghent officially ended the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain. 

The treaty stipulated that conquered territories would be returned and established commissions to settle the U.S.-Canada border. Despite not addressing the main issues that sparked the war—British interference with American trade and impressment of U.S. sailors—it was seen as a diplomatic victory for the U.S. as it opened the Great Lakes region for expansion.

The war began in June 1812, triggered by British economic blockades, the forced enlistment of American sailors, and British support for Native American attacks on the U.S. frontier. Initial American invasions of Canada were unsuccessful, but the U.S. Navy achieved several victories at sea. In 1814, after Napoleon's defeat, Britain focused more on the war, capturing Washington, D.C., and burning key government buildings. However, the British were repelled at Fort McHenry, inspiring the writing of the ""Star-Spangled Banner.""

The turning point came in September 1814 when the U.S. won a crucial naval battle at Lake Champlain, forcing British forces to retreat from the northeast. Though news of the treaty’s signing reached the U.S. too late to stop the Battle of New Orleans, where General Andrew Jackson's forces achieved a stunning victory, the simultaneous news of the peace settlement and the triumph at New Orleans boosted American national pride and unity.",en,Tweet,1,49,6,7,3367.0,2024-12-24 12:30:46,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GfkGPCWWoAEgc4g.jpg
