It makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent — avoiding an average $1,700 tax hike — and ensures families keep more of what they earn by doubling the Child Tax Credit and standard deduction.

It cuts taxes on tips and overtime pay, offers new savings tools, expands deductions for seniors, and wipes out the tax on interest for new American-made car loans. It also renews the SALT deduction, provides permanent relief from the death tax for family farms and small businesses, and doubles the expensing limit so local businesses can invest and grow.

There’s support here for farmers through lower borrowing costs, continued Opportunity Zones to draw investment into rural areas, and permanent tax breaks that encourage more production and keep jobs here at home.

More details on tax relief provisions in the package can be found at the link below.

"LaMalfa, Doug",Representative,California,1,Republican,House: 2013-Present,Yes,RepLaMalfa,'1943430037127979344',"The budget reconciliation package updates the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by returning to mandatory work requirements and tighter accountability designed to strengthen the program and ensure it serves those who need it most.

Work requirements now cover more adults, including parents with children 14 or older. These changes push for greater participation in work, volunteering, or education programs. Waivers from these rules will be limited to areas with high unemployment, making sure states like California can't exempt the entire state from the work requirement.

Benefit increases going forward will be capped to track inflation, preventing unchecked growth without Congressional approval.

For the first time, states will be responsible for a portion of actual SNAP food benefit costs, not just administrative expenses, encouraging stronger financial stewardship at the state level. The formula for state matching funds will be updated to reflect recent payment error rates, promoting better oversight and reducing waste. When states don't have skin in the game to ensure payment accuracy, the high error rates hurt SNAP recipients the most.

These changes are about making SNAP more accountable, sustainable, and focused on helping Americans get back to work.

It requires the Interior Department to hold regular lease sales for oil and gas — both onshore across the West and offshore in the Gulf and Alaska — opening up millions of acres that have been tied up for too long.

It lowers royalty rates, extends drilling permits, repeals the methane fee, and streamlines environmental reviews so projects don’t get stuck in endless bureaucratic delays. It also rolls back some of the costly renewable carve-outs from the Biden misnamed “Inflation Reduction Act” while still keeping incentives for other clean energy technologies.

The package directs BLM to open up more coal reserves and makes targeted investments in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and energy infrastructure to keep power reliable and affordable.

"LaMalfa, Doug",Representative,California,1,Republican,House: 2013-Present,Yes,RepLaMalfa,'1943690058931810815',"Medicaid (called Medi-Cal here in California) is supposed to be a safety net for children, people with disabilities, and low-income families. The new budget reconciliation law strengthens that system by making sure it’s focused on those who truly rely on it.

Here’s what’s changing. Able-bodied adults without young kids who choose not to work will now be expected to work, volunteer, or pursue education at least 80 hours a month to keep getting benefits. It’s a commonsense, bipartisan idea that promotes stability and leads to better health outcomes.

At the same time, the law tightens eligibility checks and steps up verification of citizenship and immigration status to help crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse. Over the last decade, improper Medicaid payments have totaled more than half a trillion dollars nationwide, with $56 billion just last year. That’s unacceptable.

For states like California that have pushed Medicaid far beyond its original scope, the law gradually scales back certain federal matching rates, meaning states will pick up a fairer share of the costs. It also closes loopholes that let states draw down extra federal money without actually improving care.

As for concerns about rural healthcare, the law provides $10 billion a year for five years, totaling $50 billion, to help keep small rural hospitals and clinics open. How that money gets distributed in California will come down to the Governor and state officials. It’s critical that Sacramento gets this right so our small towns and rural residents aren’t left behind.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1943712882077671667',"Each week, we share the stories of individuals across our district who go above and beyond in service to others. Today, we honor the memory of an extraordinary young man—23-year-old Bobby Pietrangelo of Sellersville—who gave his life defending freedom on the front lines of Ukraine.
 
Bobby was many things—an honor student at Pennridge High School, an Eagle Scout with Troop 354 in Hatboro, a volunteer firefighter in Silverdale and Souderton, a musician, a mentor, and a quiet but constant force for good in every space he entered. He had an extraordinary gift for humor and lightness—able to lift spirits and spark laughter, even in the darkest of times.
 
After a kidney condition disqualified him from joining the U.S. Marine Corps—a dream he held since childhood—Bobby didn’t walk away from his desire to serve. Instead, he looked outward. He looked to where he was needed most. And in the midst of one of the world’s fiercest battles for liberty, he found his purpose.
 
In April 2022, Bobby traveled to Ukraine—not for glory or recognition but to serve. He delivered critical supplies to the front lines, taught lifesaving medical skills, and recovered the wounded and fallen from bombed-out cities. But as the war intensified, so did his commitment. In June 2024, he officially enlisted in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
 
For 26 months, Bobby served with extraordinary courage. He was shot at, bombed, and injured—and returned to serve every time. But then, on January 3rd, less than three months after surviving a serious head injury in combat, he was killed in action in Pokrovsk.
 
Bobby and I share the same belief: that freedom is worth defending. That when tyranny threatens peace, we don’t stand aside—we stand up.
 
And Bobby didn’t just stand—he stepped forward. With humility. With conviction. With a fearless determination to do what was right, no matter the cost.
 
He was more than a hometown hero. He was a defender of freedom.
 
To Bobby’s family—thank you for giving the world a soul so brave, so kind, and so full of purpose. His courage, his faith, and his unwavering call to serve will inspire generations to come.
 
A Celebration of Bobby’s Life is being held on Saturday, July 26th, in Sellersville. If you wish to pay your respects, you may contact his mother, Dana at rememberingbobbymoose@gmail.com.
 
May we honor Bobby not only with our gratitude—but by striving to live with the same spirit, strength, and selflessness that he carried to the very end.",en,Tweet,10,277,66,36,7928.0,2025-07-11 17:43:58,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gvl0jzFWEAU9nt0.jpg

As Florida’s U.S. Senator and a Navy veteran myself, it’s my honor to fight to support those who fight for our nation and ensure they have everything they need to complete their missions. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, our service members know they now have an administration fully committed to that goal. I was proud to work with my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee on this year’s NDAA, which has some big wins for Florida and our national security, while also supporting President Trump’s work to ensure our military is a lethal fighting force based on merit and a warrior ethos. This includes provisions to get adversaries like Communist China out of our supply chains and technology, keep Homestead Air Reserve Base fully ready for a renewed flying mission, invest in critical military construction projects throughout the state, and ensure readiness across all domains so our warfighters can continue enacting President Trump’s peace through strength agenda.

I would like to thank Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Reed, and all of my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee for their hard work and commitment to getting this bill done. I am proud of our wins in this bill and look forward to passing this on the Senate floor and getting it to President Trump’s desk for signature.",en,Tweet,3,147,35,25,9037.0,2025-07-11 22:25:31,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

During the briefing, we watched a video showing how cartels are using drones to guide smugglers across the border and into the streets of Laredo.

We also discussed the capabilities of the Stryker units currently based in Laredo, which are equipped with high-resolution cameras so advanced they can detect something as small as a mouse from a mile away. These units are providing much-needed surveillance support and helping strengthen the efforts of our Border Patrol agents.

It was great to meet the men and women from the Department of Defense who have traveled from different parts of the country to assist CBP here in Laredo. They are working hand-in-hand with our agents, and their support is making a real difference. Once a Stryker unit is deployed to a location, the number of illegal crossings and related criminal activity drops considerably.

This wasn’t just a golf outing- it was a full-scale showcase of local business, with nearly 50 companies hosting interactive stations at each hole. It was a valuable opportunity to meet and connect with the people and companies that power our economy, create jobs, and strengthen our community.

Each stop along the course offered great conversations with business owners and team members, who shared meaningful insights about their work and the impact they’re making throughout Schuylkill County. The event was incredibly well-organized and full of Schuylkill County Pride, and Mountain Valley Golf Course provided the perfect setting for it all.

Congratulations to Schuylkill Chamber Executive Director Bob Carl, along with team members Samantha Chivinski, Tony Merchlinsky, Cierra Abrachinski, Kelly Huber, the Chamber Board of Directors, and everyone else who played a role in this successful event.

"Crenshaw, Dan",Representative,Texas,2,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepDanCrenshaw,'1944206907247366432',"What an amazing show of support today by the Kingwood community. It was an emotional sight. People lined the streets as Shiloh “Stingray” Wilson was returned home to rest and be with his parents, Jeff and Amber, who were also tragically lost in the floods on July 4th. Because of the tireless efforts of so many first responders and volunteers, they can rest together today as a family. 

I got to meet the family and friends of these amazing people. At just 12 years old, Shiloh was already a rodeo champion—tough, talented, and full of heart. He was in Kerr County for a rodeo competition - his mom and dad there to support him. His saddle, engraved with his trademark Stingray, was found 13 miles downriver after the flood and miraculously made it back to the family because the people who found it saw the Stingray and began to investigate just based on that one clue. It is being refurbished now for the family by a saddle maker in Wyoming. 

Shiloh’s father Jeff was a rodeo champion in his own right and a dedicated teacher at Kingwood Park High School, where he taught auto body repair and helped students earn certifications for high-paying jobs right out of high school. His mother, Amber, was a longtime employee at Insperity, where she worked for 27 years.

This is a quiet but critical trade deal that keeps grocery prices stable, trade lanes open, and our supply chains moving.

Here in Texas, over 150 businesses and thousands of workers depend on this agreement. Ending it could cost our state up to 32,000 jobs, $4.5 billion in losses, and raise tomato prices by 17 percent. Families would feel that impact directly at the grocery store.

Some have questioned the agreement’s effectiveness, but the facts are clear. Over 99 percent of imported tomatoes meet U.S. standards, with no evidence of widespread dumping. Ending it would hurt not just Mexican exporters but also American distributors, grocers, and workers.

This is an issue with broad support from businesses, trade experts, and community leaders who agree we should strengthen and modernize the agreement rather than abandon it.

The agreement also plays an important role in regional stability by supporting jobs on both sides of the border and easing the economic pressures that drive migration. I would respectfully encourage the Department of Commerce to continue engaging in good faith and give diplomacy the space it needs to deliver a solution that protects workers, consumers, and producers alike.

The Tomato Suspension Agreement is one of those behind-the-scenes policies that quietly keep our economy and communities strong.

"Johnson, Mike",Representative,Louisiana,4,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,SpeakerJohnson,'1944363015953866832',"One year ago today, President Trump survived an assassination attempt and terrible tragedy in Butler, PA. Just 64 days later, on his golf course in Florida, the Secret Service stopped another would-be assassin pointing a rifle through the bushes as he awaited the President just 400 yards down the course. 

**Amazingly, this cheerful photo was taken on that same day… less than 5 hours after President Trump survived a SECOND assassination attempt in just two months! 

As fate would have it, Kelly and I had just arrived to meet with him at Mar-a-Lago, right after the Secret Service agents spotted and fired at the suspect, chased after him, and rushed the President back to safety at his residence. We met and talked with him alone there for nearly 3 hours, with Susie Wiles and Hogan Gidley, until the “all clear” was given. 

We will never forget our conversation that day, and the strength and resolve of the man who would soon be reelected Commander-in-Chief. As he processed the event, I told him we were absolutely convinced that God had miraculously spared his life—once again, in view of the entire world—for an obvious purpose. 

It seemed to me then that a new realization had come upon our friend, that he had developed an even deeper sense of his place in his history, the importance of his legacy, and the divinely orchestrated responsibility he was being given. 

Since those jarring events at the end of the 2024 campaign, President Trump has been a changed man. (Two near-death experiences like that would change ANY man!) 

He was already the toughest individual we know, but now he is even more deliberate and contemplative in his approach to our nation’s challenges. He speaks openly about the providence of God, and he understands, as did the Founders of our great nation who had endured so much in the trials and suffering of the American Revolution, the high price of our freedom. As I have summarized so many times in the past year, his head and his heart are in exactly the right place for the times in which he is called again to serve. 

At the very end of our nation’s birth certificate 249 years ago, our forefathers solemnly proclaimed: “And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.” Their extraordinary commitment to America’s cause—even at the risk of their own lives and possessions—was what allowed our country to form and flourish and become the most exceptional of all. 

Thankfully, that same commitment is now carried forward by our 45th & 47th President, who has endured the most unbelievable trials, accepted every risk, and works tirelessly every day to ensure that America is great once again. May God continue to protect and sustain him.",en,Tweet,165,6663,1115,1472,229416.0,2025-07-13 12:47:22,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GvvDdvqXwAA3sta.jpg

As I was headed onstage, he prompted me to wait until after he spoke to the crowd about an immigration chart. Returning to my seat, I watched as President Trump turned his attention and head towards the chart—a decision that likely saved his life. Moments later, a bullet meant for his head struck his ear. He went down, then stood up and raised his fist in defiance. That moment captured who he is at his core—a strong leader—and marked a turning point in the 2024 election.
 
Strong leadership sets a tone -- like a ripple effect. President Trump didn’t panic and stood strong and so did the crowd. Instead of chaos, chants of “USA”rang out. 
 
But the day also brought great tragedy. Corey Comperatore—a Pennsylvanian, volunteer firefighter, and father—was sitting behind me. He died shielding his family. I’m remembering Corey and praying for the Comperatore family on this one-year anniversary.

The United States Secret Service failed to act on credible intelligence, failed to coordinate with local law enforcement, and failed to prevent an attack that nearly took the life of a then-former president.

That’s unacceptable. 

This was not a single lapse in judgment. It was a complete breakdown of security at every level—fueled by bureaucratic indifference, a lack of clear protocols, and a shocking refusal to act on direct threats.

We're working with @WhiteHouse to pass a rescissions package to CANCEL billions in wasteful spending. Here's how it works:

Under the Impoundment Control Act, we asked the Trump administration to send Congress a package of previously appropriated federal funds for us to eliminate. 

Note: this rescissions package only requires a simple majority vote (aka 51 of our 53 @SenateGOP seats). 

Among other cuts, this rescissions package targets billions in wasteful foreign aid spending. It’s a good step, we have a lot more to do.

After the Trump administration sent this rescissions package over, the law gives Congress 45 DAYS to review the funding and strike it down. Deadline is this Friday 7/18.

The implicit bias of LNP is clear in their print and digital headlines.
 
Their latest article lays out the exact reason why I do not do in-person town halls. Organizations like Indivisible have a playbook for intentionally disrupting public events. As I have said for years, I am interested in having productive conversations. I do that routinely meeting constituents one-on-one, in small groups, through telephone town halls, visits across the community, and more. Having a productive conversation is impossible when there are individuals who intend to disrupt the event. Public discourse is done a disservice with these antics.

Our nation must never forget the injustices committed against Japanese Americans, families like the Odas, who lived and worked in our own community and were ripped apart simply because of their heritage.
