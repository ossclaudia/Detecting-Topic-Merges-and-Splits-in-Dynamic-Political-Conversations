This data reflects the dedication of local leaders and residents to building neighborhoods where people can live, work, and thrive without fear. When neighbors feel confident engaging in community life, it strengthens connections and fosters a sense of belonging that unites us all.

"Massie, Thomas",Representative,Kentucky,4,Republican,House: 2012-Present,Yes,RepThomasMassie,'1961138358186545428',"Last night, I had dinner with and spoke to more than 100 constituents at a Lewis County Chamber of Commerce event.

As a native of Lewis County, and the former County Judge/Executive, it was a pleasure to see so many familiar faces, including current Judge/Executive George Sparks, Lewis County Attorney Ben Harrison, Kentucky State Representative Patrick Flannery, Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, and Warrior Ridge founder Landon Bentley. Thanks to Lewis County Sheriff Johnny Bivens and his deputies for keeping Lewis County safe. I shared a few stories from my time in local office and expressed my sincere appreciation for the work our county officials do.

I also expressed how seriously I take my vote in Congress. My vote does not belong to the Republican Party, to the Speaker of the House, or to whomever is in the White House‚Äîit belongs to the 750,000 people of the Fourth District. One issue that often influences how I vote is our rising national debt. I showed those in attendance the debt badge I built and wear and explained how it is meant to raise awareness among my colleagues of just how serious our debt crisis is. My goal is for each of them, every time they vote, to consider this rapidly growing number and how it will‚Äîand already is‚Äîaffecting the future of this country, our children, and grandchildren.

Another priority of mine is to help the counties and communities in my district without growing government. The PRIME Act is a piece of legislation I‚Äôve introduced that would serve all Americans, but would greatly benefit agricultural areas, such as Lewis County. Currently, in order to sell individual cuts of locally raised meats to consumers, farmers and ranchers must first send their animals to one of a limited number of USDA-inspected slaughterhouses. The PRIME Act would give individual states freedom to permit intrastate distribution of custom-slaughtered meat such as beef, pork, or lamb to consumers, restaurants, hotels, boarding houses, and grocery stores. I am hopeful that provisions from the PRIME Act will be included in this year‚Äôs Farm Bill. The PRIME Act would also be a fitting addition to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‚Äôs plan to Make America Healthy Again (MAHA).

A special thank you to Joni Pugh, who serves on the Lewis County Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, for inviting me to speak.

Mike‚Äôs story reminds us that the price of freedom is not abstract. It is written in the scars of our warriors and in the unshakable strength of their families. It is borne every day by those who serve and by those who love them.

Michael Verardo was a faithful servant. A patriot. A hero. As we mourn his passing, let us pray for his family‚Äîand let us honor his legacy by standing with every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, and family who has borne the cost of liberty. The finest way to honor Sgt. Verardo and all who serve is to live as Americans worthy of their sacrifice‚Äîgrateful for liberty, united with one another, and committed to the cause of freedom.",en,Tweet,1,47,4,9,2368.0,2025-08-28 23:41:20,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1961197337763565568/vid/avc1/884x490/ZMl6Bf1IDkn4-qT6.mp4?tag=21

This tragedy exposed the painful truth about racial inequities, poverty, and the government‚Äôs failure to respond when underserved communities were most in need. 

The storm was a wake-up call that climate change has diminished crucial natural buffers against hurricanes throughout the Gulf - severely impacting ecosystems and communities.

As we mark this anniversary, we honor the resilience of survivors, the lives lost, and the communities that fought to rebuild against all odds. And we recommit ourselves to ensuring that never again will vulnerable communities be left behind in the face of disaster.

At the San Diego Civic Center, I discussed the upcoming renovations that will be made possible through $1,000,000 in federal community project funding I secured for Duval County. This investment will support improvements at all four of the county‚Äôs community centers, creating safe and welcoming spaces where residents can gather and access vital services. While there, I also spoke with seniors and staff to hear their priorities and how these resources will strengthen daily life once the projects are complete.

I‚Äôll keep fighting for Duval County by delivering resources, supporting local projects, and listening directly to residents about their needs.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1961493314227560719',"Each week, we share stories from across our district of neighbors whose courage, character, and quiet acts of service remind us what makes Bucks County such a special place to call home. Today, we honor a woman whose ordinary workday became an extraordinary act of heroism. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero, Sarah Van de Laar of Bensalem.
 
Sarah has spent the past six years serving our community as a @USPS letter carrier. Like so many of her colleagues, she is a familiar, steady presence in the lives of those along her route‚Äîsomeone neighbors count on day in and day out.
 
But one afternoon on Knights Road, Sarah‚Äôs route became anything but routine. She saw a car veer off the curb and crash, and in that moment, she didn‚Äôt think twice. She stopped, ran to the scene, and found the driver slumped over in his seat. She immediately called 911, pulled him from the vehicle with the help of a passerby, and began CPR. Calm, steady, and determined, she kept going until first responders arrived. Only later did she learn that her quick action had saved his life. And weeks later, when she saw him again face to face, she described that moment simply as ‚Äúa gift.‚Äù
 
In her own words, Sarah doesn‚Äôt see herself as a hero: ‚ÄúI just consider myself a human being. I come into my job every day, go home, and see my family.‚Äù That‚Äôs who she is‚Äîhumble, steady, devoted to her work and her community.  She reminds us that true heroism often comes from ordinary people who act with extraordinary courage when it matters most.
 
Our letter carriers don‚Äôt just deliver mail‚Äîthey deliver trust, connection, and care. They are often the first to notice when something is wrong, the ones who look out for our seniors, and the steady presence that keeps our communities connected day after day. Yet too often, their service is taken for granted. That is why I have made it a top priority to partner with our local carriers and advocates across the nation to ensure their voices are heard. Together, we‚Äôve fought to strengthen the Postal Service, secure fair treatment, and deliver the resources they need to keep doing their jobs with pride. Sarah‚Äôs courage is a reminder of the extraordinary humanity at the heart of this work‚Äîand why I will always stand shoulder to shoulder with our postal workers, here at home and across America.
 
Join me in celebrating Sarah for her bravery and service, and thanking every postal worker for the countless ways they keep our neighborhoods strong and our country moving forward.

First clue that most of these protesters probably weren't actual constituents: they tried to shout me down when I gave an update on funding for FLOOD MITIGATION, which is priority #1 in Kingwood. 

They‚Äôd know how important these projects are if they actually lived in Kingwood during Hurricane Harvey. 

Anyways, the protestors did a great job of annoying all the actual constituents in the room and made it really easy to identify themselves with their red cards (you‚Äôll see what I mean in the video. It was kind of hilarious actually). 

If the left keeps this up 2026 is going to be a really good year for Republicans. 

The left‚Äôs message is clear: raise your taxes, open the border back up, and encourage children to transition their gender.

"Salinas, Andrea",Representative,Oregon,6,Democratic,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepSalinas,'1961602880894296520',"On Wednesday, U.S. Border Patrol arrested two firefighters who were working to combat the ongoing blaze in Washington‚Äôs Olympic Peninsula. At least one of those firefighters is a constituent from Keizer, OR. During his detention, my constituent was denied his constitutional right to an attorney and a phone call.

I‚Äôm appalled that the Trump Administration is arresting firefighters to meet their arbitrary deportation quotas. These firefighters risk their lives to keep us safe, and this is how Trump treats them. It‚Äôs sick and twisted. This does not make us safer or stronger. Border Patrol should not be prowling our national forests to arrest firefighters.

While I cannot provide the name of the firefighter, I can share additional details about his background and his unconstitutional detention. My constituent was brought to the United States when he was a young child and has lived here his entire life. The United States is the only home he knows. For the past three years, he has bravely served as a wildland firefighter, putting his life on the line to protect our communities.

Additionally, seven years ago, my constituent and his family were victims of a federal crime. As a result of cooperating with federal officials during their investigation, my constituent and his family became eligible for a ‚ÄúU visa.‚Äù Their application has been pending with USCIS for the past seven years and if granted would provide them legal status and a pathway to citizenship.

On August 27, my constituent was working to combat the Bear Gulch Wildfire when CBP stopped his crew and arrested him. Over the next nearly 48 hours, the whereabouts of my constituent were unknown. He was not entered into the ICE detainee locator.

I have since learned that my constituent was taken to the CBP facility in Bellingham Washington. His legal team called the CBP Bellingham station. The CBP attendant refused to confirm his detention location or grant them access. When they called again, the CBP attendant confirmed that he was being transferred to ICE custody but would not grant his attorney access.

On Friday, my constituent was moved to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, WA, where he was finally granted access to a phone call and called his attorneys, which is how we were able to learn his story.

As of now, he is still not in the ICE detainee locator.

I have also been in touch with my constituent‚Äôs lawyers. I‚Äôm deeply concerned that CBP has been concealing his whereabouts and has denied him due process. I‚Äôm working with my Congressional colleagues to hold the Trump Administration accountable and demand that they immediately provide details about the arrest and failure to honor my constituent‚Äôs rights.

For nearly 9 decades, Roller Die + Forming has been a leading producer of standard and custom roll formed parts all over the world. In roll forming, sheet metal passes through a specific set of matched rolls. Each set of rolls touches the passing metal and changes the shape resulting in the desired cross section.

The Green Cove Springs facility produces many different parts for various industries including heavy truck, bus, medical, and building products. 

With locations across the United States, Roller Die made the decision to relocate their headquarters to Florida as our state has the most business friendly climate bar none. 

During the tour, we discussed the jobs their facility brought to the region, the successes they are seeing via tariffs, and how the One, Big Beautiful Bill boosts American manufacturing. 

Included in the One, Big Beautiful Bill: 

‚úÖ Full expensing for new factories and factory improvements to accelerate domestic manufacturing.
‚úÖ Full expensing for domestic R&D to encourage domestic innovation.

I also have great empathy for all of those who were forced to take it in order to keep their jobs or to continue their education.

Millions of people have reported vaccine injuries and deaths from taking the forced Covid vaccines.

And people have continuously died suddenly, developed cancer, and suffered heart damage, neurological problems, and more from taking Covid vaccines and boosters.

And for what?

A man made virus that was pretty much only dangerous to the elderly, immune compromised, diabetics, and obese people in our population, which by the way are also at risk from the flu and any other virus or infection.

Covid was never a serious threat to the HEALTHY working adult population and was never a serious threat to children.

President Reagan spoke about our free labor system (and owning the rewards of your own labor), drawing a sharp contrast from the oppressive labor systems behind the Iron Curtain, where your labor belonged only to the communist elites. 

Those systems treated workers as tools of the state. Ours treat workers as individuals, free to earn, build, innovate, and thrive. It‚Äôs the reason America became the most prosperous nation in history while socialist regimes collapse.

The old famous Soviet line come to mind: ‚ÄúWe will pretend to work as long as they keep pretending to pay us!‚Äù That‚Äôs not a recipe for productivity or innovation. Achievements happen because people are incentivized by the belief that their hard work will pay off AND they‚Äôll own it, not the state. 

The people who produce very little resent this system, always voting for politicians who promise to take from the productive members of society and redistribute their wealth to them. They offer up some rationale of an unequal playing field, social justice, etc- whatever buzzword of the day fits their agenda.

"Stefanik, Elise M.",Representative,New York,21,Republican,House: 2015-Present,Yes,RepStefanik,'1962953907543671204',"Today, I sent a letter to Governor Kathy Hochul demanding answers on her ‚ÄúNo Call‚Äù List targeting fired correctional officers.

I was made aware that there exists within the Department a ‚ÄúNO CALL LIST‚Äù of approximately 200 individuals whom Hochul and Commissioner Martuscello have determined are not to be offered employment. This list, circulated to Superintendents across the state, is an attempt to block dedicated COs from returning to work.

I am requesting answers to the following questions:

1) What are the criteria Hochul and the Commissioner used to determine the composition of this list of individuals who are not to be rehired?

2) Are the individuals on that list being targeted for expressing their opinions on the strike, the HALT Act, or other actions taken by the Hochul administration?

Commissioner Martuscello and Governor Hochul have engaged in coercive, unethical, and illegal actions against thousands of correctional officers and prison staff. This blacklist is just the latest of Hochul's abuses of power as she seeks to bully and intimidate. Our brave correctional officers and prison staff deserve better, and New Yorkers deserve to know about Kathy Hochul's underhanded revenge tactics.

"Stefanik, Elise M.",Representative,New York,21,Republican,House: 2015-Present,Yes,RepStefanik,'1962957079708369066',"Today, I sent a letter to the @SecretaryLCD calling for a federal investigation into actions by Governor Hochul and Commissioner Martuscello that potentially violated The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA).

In retaliation for the strike earlier this year by employees of the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), Governor Hochul and her administration violated the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). Specifically, the state directed employees on FMLA leave to be classified as absent without leave (AWOL), resulting in their termination.

In a copy of an email obtained by my office, the DOCCS Deputy Commissioner for Administrative Services instructed prison superintendents that ""staff who are calling in FMLA should be ordered in just like everyone else. If they refuse the order to report for duty, they should be made AWOL."" These actions resulted in the wrongful termination of DOCCS employees, in violation of federal regulations.

By classifying DOCCS employees on FMLA as AWOL, Governor Hochul and the DOCCS Commissioner caused families to lose access to health insurance, accrued overtime pay, sick leave, and unemployment benefits. As the COs challenge their loss of employment through the grievance process or appeal the denial of their unemployment benefits, they are being slow-rolled through the process with no communication from the New York State Office of Employee Relations or the Department of Labor. This is a clear-cut, coordinated abuse of power by Governor Hochul and Commissioner Martuscello, specifically their actions to deny employment and earned benefits to Correctional Officers and DOCCS employees.

This is just the latest in a long line of abuses of power and blatant attacks on law enforcement by Governor Hochul and her administration. I request that you review the illegal actions taken by New York State and compel compliance with FMLA for those employees who were terminated while on approved leave.
