At 8:46 a.m., an American Airlines Boeing 767 crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing hundreds instantly and trapping many others. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03 a.m., United Airlines Flight 175, another Boeing 767, struck the south tower near the 60th floor.

The attacks were soon revealed to be part of a coordinated effort by Islamic terrorists from Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations, financed by Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda. They had been living in the U.S. and received flight training and hijacked four planes.

At 9:37 a.m., American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.

The south tower of the World Trade Center collapsed at 9:59 a.m., followed by the north tower at 10:28 a.m., due to the intense heat from the burning jet fuel compromising the structural integrity of the skyscrapers. 

The collapse led to the deaths of nearly 3,000 people, including 343 firefighters, 23 police officers, and 37 Port Authority officers.

"Meuser, Daniel",Representative,Pennsylvania,9,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepMeuser,'1966114614908768295',"On this solemn anniversary, we once again vow to Never Forget September 11, 2001. What began as a clear and beautiful morning quickly became a day of unspeakable tragedy and extraordinary heroism.

I remember driving my daughter to school, unaware of the horror that was about to unfold. Like so many Americans, I watched in disbelief as the planes struck the Twin Towers, as the Pentagon was attacked, and as the heroes aboard Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania made the ultimate sacrifice to save countless others.

In the days after, I traveled to Ground Zero, delivering scooters at the request of the NYPD—not for the injured, but for firefighters, police officers, and first responders who had been on their feet for days, navigating the devastation as they worked tirelessly in rescue and recovery efforts.

In the face of tragedy, Americans came together. Streets filled with flags, neighbors lined up to cheer first responders, and chants of “USA” echoed at ballgames and town squares. Out of the darkness of that day came a renewed patriotism and unity that reminded us of who we are as a people.

As President Lincoln declared, “We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” Those words endure today, as our great nation continues to produce patriots who carry forward the cause of freedom and unity—like the late Charlie Kirk, whose life and legacy remind us that America will thrive, and never perish from the earth.",en,Tweet,0,10,1,1,783.0,2025-09-11 13:20:27,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0kK0pPXYAA61aQ.jpg

I’m calling on believers everywhere to put on the true armor of God, to wage war in prayer against evil and principalities. Jesus gave us this power, but we must use it. Use the sword of the spirit. We already know who wins, but it is our responsibility to engage in the battle. We have the power through Christ to break the strongholds of evil, but it starts with each of us.

Charlie was truly one of the smartest men I’ve ever met. He was also one of the most courageous. He was not afraid to continually share his faith and beliefs. He was not afraid to debate anyone at any time, and for those keeping score, he usually won.

One of my favorite things about Charlie is that he made his mission in life to go deep behind enemy lines in academia, where conservative thoughts and principles are considered “hate speech,” and present an alternative worldview to the next generation.

If I’m being honest, I think myself and many others abandoned academia a long time ago as a completely lost cause. Not only did Charlie have courage, but he had vision. He could see and do things that many of us cannot.

I am disgusted and hurt by the murder of my friend. I’m also saddened that my children and yours must grow up in this world with so much wickedness and evil.

This is just one more very deep and painful reminder to us that life is short and precious. We must make our time here count and keep our priorities straight.

John 14:6 “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” I know where Charlie is today. He’s definitely in a much better place, but if I know anything about my friend, he wasn’t done fighting down here.

Above all other nations, the United States of America endures as a beacon of freedom, bravery, and indomitable spirit—especially in the face of tragedy and destruction. Twenty-four years ago, as Islamic terrorists sought to break our nation’s spirit and extinguish the flame of freedom, countless heroes rose up to renew our faith and strengthen our resolve.

Among them was Welles Crowther, “the man in the red bandana.” A 24-year-old volunteer firefighter, Welles repeatedly charged into the flames of the South Tower to lead eighteen people to safety before giving his life as the building collapsed. He brought calm in the midst of terror, saved lives so families could be made whole again, and left us an enduring example that even in times of unthinkable calamity, we can reach beyond ourselves to serve others.

This year’s remembrance of 9/11 comes with added sorrow. Just yesterday, our conservative movement lost a great friend and remarkable leader: Charlie Kirk. Charlie embodied grace in the face of hostility, deep love for our nation, hope for every soul he encountered, and unshakable faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ. He inspired millions of young Americans to find purpose, rejoice in their love of Christ, and cherish the blessings of family and children. Though his years were too few—just thirty-one—Charlie’s life was marked by courage, conviction, and self-sacrifice worthy of recognition on a day when we honor American heroes like Welles Crowther.

Perhaps just as important is the scar it left on our country.

But with that scar came a lesson—a lesson not only about what our enemies are capable of, but also what the American spirit is capable of.

“Charlie Kirk was more than a Conservative trailblazer, he was a devoted husband, a loving father, and a Martyr for Conservatism and Christianity,” said Congresswoman Mary Miller. “As a proud Illinois native, his courage inspired millions to stand boldly for their faith, to love America, and defend freedom. As we honor his legacy with this Congressional Resolution, we lift Erika and their children in prayer and recommit ourselves to advancing the values he boldly championed.”

“The murder of Charlie Kirk is a tragic reminder of just how far our nation has spiraled from the days of political discourse to the depths of political violence,” said Congressman Mike Bost. “Charlie was a native son of Illinois whose faith, love of family, and commitment to thoughtfully engaging young people in the political process will leave a lasting mark. I am humbled to join my Illinois Republican colleagues in introducing a House resolution honoring Charlie’s life and legacy. My prayers go out to his wife, Erika, their two young children, and all who were impacted by this horrific attack.”

“Charlie Kirk’s murder was a despicable act of political violence,” said Congressman Darin LaHood. “He was a husband and father who did not deserve to die simply because of his political beliefs. Charlie dedicated his life to advocating for free speech, engaging in civil discourse, and investing in the next generation of Americans. I was proud to join my colleagues in the Illinois Delegation to introduce a resolution honoring his legacy and commitment to the bettering of America. My prayers remain with Charlie’s family and loved ones in light of this tragedy.”

My bipartisan Patriot Day Act (H.R. 911) establishes September 11th as a permanent federal holiday of reflection and service, a lasting tribute to the courage of those who gave everything, and a promise that we will never forget.

I’m humbled and honored to have the support of the @GLFOP, @NYCPBA, and @IAFFofficial, whose members led us through our darkest hours and continue to carry the weight of that day.

Let’s honor their sacrifice, and all those we lost, with action.

Our nation was founded on the battle of ideas. And because of that healthy debate 250 years ago, we live in the greatest country on earth.

The depth of this tragedy is hard to process: a life cut short at age 31, a wife left without a husband, two young children without a father.

The tributes that have poured in these last 24 hours from people of all walks of life and all corners of the political universe – the raw grief, the remarkable eulogies – bear testament to a life of generational importance, a life cruelly limited in years but immeasurable in impact.

I offer my own most heartfelt prayers alongside the hundreds of millions of others in this country and around the world. As we pray for Charlie and his loved ones, so too do I pray for our country. 

We are in a perilous moment. We don’t yet have all the facts about yesterday’s horrifying events – and the killer remains at large. What we do know is that political division has continued to deepen in this country and that political violence is on the rise.

With a loss this profound, with evil this glaring, with so much pain and suffering and anger and fear – this cycle could escalate. But that isn’t where things have to go. This can also be an occasion for soul-searching as a country. 

A simple thing we can all do: if you have a friend or family member who you have stopped talking to because of political differences, this might be a good time to reach out. To say, we’re still friends, we’re still family. Politics isn’t everything. And politics itself, when properly conducted, can foster friendship and build community even among ideological opponents.

That’s what Charlie Kirk devoted his life to. He brought people of all perspectives together to talk to one another. To have a vigorous exchange of ideas. To discuss how we can best fulfill America’s promise. To participate in democracy.

Fed by the Left calling conservatives “Nazis.” Fed by branding parents as “domestic terrorists.” Fed by politicians and media figures who pound the drum that anyone who disagrees with them is an enemy of democracy. You pump that poison into a culture long enough, and regular people start believing hate is righteous, violence is justified. And that’s how you end up in a country where celebrating murder feels normal. That is evil. Plain and simple.

But evil won’t have the last word. For every person mocking Charlie’s death, there are thousands more praying, grieving, and standing firm in the fight for faith, family, and freedom.

"Roy, Chip",Representative,Texas,21,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepChipRoy,'1966542813270512080',"🚨FULL TEXT: Rep. Roy Requests Formation of Select Committee to Investigate the Left’s Assault on America and the Rule of Law: 

""Speaker Johnson, Chairman Jordan, and Chairman Comer,

I respectfully request that the House of Representatives form a select committee on “The money, influence, and power behind the radical left’s assault on America and the rule of law.” In the wake of numerous attacks on our way of life, the destruction of the rule of law, and the murder of innocent Americans, prominent and unknown alike, we must take every step to follow the money and uncover the force behind the NGOs, donors, media, public officials, and all entities driving this coordinated attack.

The patterns are undeniable: we are witnessing a sustained breakdown of law and order, fueled not by chance, but by anti-American ideology. Of course, we witnessed the 2024 assassination attempt on President Trump as well as the 2017 shooting of Republican lawmakers at baseball practice, but it goes well beyond politicians and to the people themselves.

We have seen targets placed on the Family Research Council and Charlie Kirk by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) only to witness shootings toward each, including the tragic assassination of Charlie just this week, after being placed on the SPLC’s notorious “Hate Map” three months ago. We have seen dangerous networks like Antifa organize, fund, and deploy sophisticated terror campaigns attacking law enforcement and destroying American cities.

We have seen George Soros, the Wren Collective, and other radical organizations funding and putting in place District Attorneys and Judges to then coordinate releasing criminals to the streets. The result has been death and injury to thousands of Americans, including the recent horrifying murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska at the hands of a 14-time released criminal and lesser-known attacks like the shooting of San Antonio security guard and former Marine, Jimmy Friesenhahn, leaving him paralyzed.

However, the coordinated lawlessness and disorder are perhaps most apparent in the forces behind the opening of our borders to release untold numbers of illegal aliens, including dangerous actors who've victimized law-abiding Americans. Laken Riley, whose convicted killer illegally crossed our border and was released into the interior by the Biden administration, was arrested, got released, and then murdered Laken. Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin also fell victim to these coordinated efforts, as their illegal alien assailants took advantage of a deliberately wide-open border, funded by cash given to the U.N.-affiliated and U.S.-taxpayer-funded International Organization for Migration that facilitated the invasion of our borders. There are countless other examples.

Enough is enough. We must follow the money to identify the perpetrators of the coordinated anti-American assaults being carried out against us and take all steps under the law necessary to stop them. The best option is a full, stand-alone committee with complete authority to elevate and investigate these matters. However, I respectfully request that we establish such a committee. It should be comprised of Members and staff with prosecutorial and/or law enforcement backgrounds, and we should grant it full subpoena powers and authority to deliver results.

We can no longer pretend to be bound together by shared ideals when a well-funded, vitriolic cadre of our fellow Americans and foreign interests are at war with the very values of faith in God, fidelity to our Constitution, and respect for the principles of liberty and Western Civilization that define us as Americans – including, notably, the free speech practiced and exemplified by Charlie Kirk.

I am sending this letter for myself and a growing number of colleagues who have been able to respond quickly in support of this call to action, and I will hold this letter open requesting all of my colleagues join with us to say it is time for us to haul all of these actors before Congress and get to the truth behind the coordinated global network funding and fueling this attack on Americans.""",en,Tweet,21,481,159,232,49840.0,2025-09-12 17:41:57,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Dr. Sampson, a father of three, jumped into action—climbing a fence to reach the roof of a nearby building, stepping onto the track himself, and carrying the frightened boy to safety.
 
He may have described himself as just a guy in the right place at the right time, but to the boy he saved, his family, and all of us here in Bucks County, he is much more. His actions weren’t an accident of circumstance—they were the instinct of a man who has built his life around care and service. As a veterinarian, business owner, and community member, he has devoted himself to healing and strengthening the bonds between families and their beloved pets. That same compassion is exactly what he brought to that moment on the monorail track.
 
Heroism isn’t reserved for a few—it’s found in the everyday decisions we make to protect and care for one another. Dr. Sampson’s example calls on each of us to act when someone is in need and reminds us we are at our best when we show up for one another.
 
Please join me in honoring Dr. Sampson for this extraordinary act of selfless bravery!",en,Tweet,0,20,1,4,1719.0,2025-09-12 17:50:30,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0qSOLQXwAAxc_x.jpg

✅ Enforce transparency and accountability at the highest levels of the Pentagon
✅ Accelerate cleanup at military sites and surrounding neighborhoods nationwide
✅ Deliver answers and action for families long left in limbo

As Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Task Force, I’ve made this a top priority. My Mental Health in Schools Excellence Program Act tackles this crisis by:

✅ Expanding school-based mental health services
✅ Creating a tuition-matching program to train more psychologists, counselors, and social workers
✅ Prioritizing high-need schools and underserved students
✅ Addressing the fact that nearly 38% of students lack sufficient access to mental health professionals

"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1967020750763614535',"It has been a difficult week for our country. Despite hatred, murder, and violence making headlines, we’re all resolved that good will triumph over evil!

As you know, on Wednesday, September 10th, 2025, a gunman assassinated Charlie Kirk during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. Charlie was only 31 years old and left behind a precious family that includes his wife and two young children.

As we process Charlie's death, as well as the death of Iryna Zarutska and the homicide of an elderly couple from Oklahoma, we must consider what these acts of evil mean for us as a country. We have to look up. There is a quote by Charles Spurgeon that hangs on my office wall that I have stared at a few times this week: ""You cannot cast out Satan by Satan, nor correct error by violence, nor overcome hate by hate. The conquering weapon of the Christian is love."" 

Our country is in the middle of a physical struggle as well as a spiritual battle that is occurring in our hearts. On the physical front, our government must ensure that public safety, the rule of law, and freedom of speech continue to be advanced without retreat or fear. As the Proverb reminds us, “The wicked man flees though no man pursues, yet the righteous are as bold as a lion.”

As Charlie Kirk often reminded us, self-governance is key to our U.S. form of government. Charlie often quoted President John Adams, who, in 1798, wrote to the Massachusetts Militia saying: “We have no Government armed with Power capable of contending with human Passions unbridled by morality and Religion. Avarice, Ambition, Revenge or Gallantry, would break the strongest Cords of our Constitution as a Whale goes through a Net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

Charlie rightly knew that the limited government that our Founders handed us only works if it is in tandem with the self-governance of our personal actions. This week has shown us how self-governance is under attack from the lack of virtue in personal conduct. This is why spiritual inventory must be renewed in our country.

While fighting on the spiritual front as individuals, we must continue to speak the truth in love. Real love cannot be without truth, and real truth cannot be absent from love. (See below…1 Corinthians 13:1-8) 

I pray that Charlie's death acts as a turning point for our nation, that our culture will take personal inventory, and that starts in each individual heart (including my own). Below are some scriptures I have been mulling over that I hope are valuable to you in your personal reflections:",en,Tweet,3,42,9,13,3276.0,2025-09-14 01:21:07,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0xC8fWWkAAcTBv.jpg
"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1967021095921303571',"1 John 4:20
If someone says, ""I love God,"" and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.

1 John 3:15
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

Matthew 5:43-48
You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. 

2 Corinthians 10:3-5
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, on the righteous and the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

Romans 13:1-5
Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.

1 Corinthians 13:1-8
If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing. Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away.",en,Reply,0,5,0,2,122.0,2025-09-14 01:22:29,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1967021278671630439',"Galatians 5:7-9; 13-26
You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth? This persuasion did not come from Him who calls you. A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough. For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, ""You shall love your neighbor as yourself."" But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one. 

Ephesians 4:14-15; 18-20; 30-32
As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn Christ in this way? Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.

Ephesians 6:11-19
Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel.",en,Reply,0,5,0,1,130.0,2025-09-14 01:23:12,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

You have heard that the ancients were told, 'You shall not commit murder' and 'Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.' But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing,' shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.

John 12:24-25
Jesus said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal.”

James 3:8-18
But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison. With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God; from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way. Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water? Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh. Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy. And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1967222145643085842',"Reposting this important message:

It has been a difficult week for our country. Despite hatred, murder, and violence making headlines, we’re all resolved that good will triumph over evil!

As you know, on Wednesday, September 10th, 2025, a gunman assassinated Charlie Kirk during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. Charlie was only 31 years old and left behind a precious family that includes his wife and two young children. 

As we process Charlie's death, as well as the death of Iryna Zarutska and the homicide of an elderly couple from Oklahoma, we must consider what these acts of evil mean for us as a country. We have to look up. There is a quote by Charles Spurgeon that hangs on my office wall that I have stared at a few times this week: ""You cannot cast out Satan by Satan, nor correct error by violence, nor overcome hate by hate. The conquering weapon of the Christian is love."" 

Our country is in the middle of a physical struggle as well as a spiritual battle that is occurring in our hearts. On the physical front, our government must ensure that public safety, the rule of law, and freedom of speech continue to be advanced without retreat or fear. As the Proverb reminds us, “The wicked man flees though no man pursues, yet the righteous are as bold as a lion.”

As Charlie Kirk often reminded us, self-governance is key to our U.S. form of government. Charlie often quoted President John Adams, who, in 1798, wrote to the Massachusetts Militia saying: “We have no Government armed with Power capable of contending with human Passions unbridled by morality and Religion. Avarice, Ambition, Revenge or Gallantry, would break the strongest Cords of our Constitution as a Whale goes through a Net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

Charlie rightly knew that the limited government that our Founders handed us only works if it is in tandem with the self-governance of our personal actions. This week has shown us how self-governance is under attack from the lack of virtue in personal conduct. This is why spiritual inventory must be renewed in our country.

While fighting on the spiritual front as individuals, we must continue to speak the truth in love. Real love cannot be without truth, and real truth cannot be absent from love. (See below…1 Corinthians 13:1-8) 

I pray that Charlie's death acts as a turning point for our nation, that our culture will take personal inventory, and that starts in each individual heart (including my own). Below are some scriptures I have been mulling over that I hope are valuable to you in your personal reflections: 

1 John 4:20
If someone says, ""I love God,"" and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.

1 John 3:15
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

John 12:24-25
Jesus said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal.”

Matthew 5:43-48
You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.",en,Tweet,5,32,9,11,2096.0,2025-09-14 14:41:23,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0z6HMbWgAA3Xgq.jpg
"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1967222333145600118',"2 Corinthians 10:3-5
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, on the righteous and the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

Romans 13:1-5
Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.

1 Corinthians 13:1-8
If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing. Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away.",en,Reply,0,3,0,0,100.0,2025-09-14 14:42:08,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1967222415689183286',"Galatians 5:7-9; 13-26
You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth? This persuasion did not come from Him who calls you. A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough. For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, ""You shall love your neighbor as yourself."" But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one. 

Ephesians 4:14-15; 18-20; 30-32
As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn Christ in this way? Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.

Ephesians 6:11-19
Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel.",en,Reply,0,4,0,0,110.0,2025-09-14 14:42:27,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

You have heard that the ancients were told, 'You shall not commit murder' and 'Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.' But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing,' shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.

James 3:8-18
But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison. With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God; from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way. Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water? Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh. Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy. And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

"Panetta, Jimmy",Representative,California,19,Democratic,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepJimmyPanetta,'1967623323010920755',"Housing costs are squeezing families across the country, from record mortgage payments to rents rising faster than inflation. The Census Bureau’s new data makes clear what so many working families in CA-19 already know: the cost of housing is out of control.
 
We need to take a comprehensive approach to housing affordability, from the bottom up.
 
My Workforce Housing Tax Credit Act would increase the supply of affordable housing for middle-income families who earn too much to qualify for low-income housing and not enough to afford a home near where they work. My First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit Act would provide qualifying first-time homebuyers with a $15,000 tax credit toward the purchase of a new home, providing them with the support that is needed to build wealth and put down roots in our communities. My More Homes on the Market Act would double the capital gains exemption on home sales and allow homeowners looking to downsize to do so without sacrificing their nest eggs. We need to provide real relief for renters through the Rent Relief Act, further expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, and incentivize the use of Project-Based Vouchers.
 
We can and must make affordable housing a priority, and I’ll keep pushing to ensure every family has the chance to put down roots and build a future in our communities.

What is happening now is entirely different. Celebrating the murder of an innocent man is not a harmless opinion, it crosses every moral line.
