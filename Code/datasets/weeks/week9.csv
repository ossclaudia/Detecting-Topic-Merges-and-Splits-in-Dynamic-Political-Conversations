It is disappointing that Turkey has welcomed Hamas leaders with open arms following Qatar‚Äôs eviction of these terrorists.

On October 7th, 2023, Hamas murdered 46 Americans and kidnapped 12. Seven U.S. citizens remain hostage in Gaza, even after the brutal execution of Hersh Goldberg-Polin while in captivity.

This is in addition to countless other citizens of NATO allies who were also murdered and kidnapped. It is unbecoming of a NATO member to harbor foreign designated terrorists with allied blood and hostages on its hands, particularly ones who have already been criminally indicted.

We urge Turkey to abide by the U.S.-Turkey bilateral extradition treaty and immediately arrest and transfer over those Hamas leaders who have been indicted in U.S. courts for their heinous crimes.

This is an opportunity to improve Turkish-congressional relations and strengthen the bonds of our friendship.

Today, we pause to honor the life of an extraordinary man‚ÄîFrank Mongiello of Yardley, an ALS Warrior whom we sadly lost this week, and whose courage, advocacy, and unwavering determination changed lives and inspired a movement of hope.
 
In 2015, Frank's life was forever changed by his ALS diagnosis‚Äîa moment that could have silenced hope for many. Though this devastating disease slowly claimed his ability to walk, talk, swallow, and even breathe, it never touched his indomitable spirit. Instead, he turned his battle into a powerful mission. Refusing to let ALS define him, Frank became a tireless voice for the voiceless and a symbol of resilience and hope for millions of families nationwide.
 
Frank was a driving force behind my Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, & Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act. Our historic law created a new pathway for terminally ill patients caught between the traditional drug approval delays, clinical trials for which they do not qualify, and limited time to access experimental treatments, providing families the opportunity to pursue potentially life-saving treatments for their loved ones. It was one of the greatest honors of my life to work alongside Frank as we fought to turn this vision into a reality. His relentless determination and advocacy were instrumental in shaping this law‚Äîfrom its conception to its passage.
 
Frank was more than an advocate; he was a devoted husband, a proud father of six, and a steadfast friend. Alongside his wife, Marilyn, he used his platform to amplify the voices of others, showing the world the power of courage, compassion, and action. 
 
Frank's story is one of extraordinary strength and selflessness. His unwavering resolve reminds us of the importance of standing up for those who cannot stand for themselves. He showed us that even in the face of unimaginable adversity, hope can ignite change, and determination can move mountains.
 
Please join me in offering condolences to Marilyn, their children, and all who knew and loved Frank‚Äîa true Hometown Hero.

The ship sank quickly, and Lim was one of the few survivors, managing to escape on a small life raft with little more than some biscuits, a few tins of water, and a flare gun. Stranded in the South Atlantic Ocean, Lim faced extreme challenges, including hunger, dehydration, and brutal exposure to the elements. Using his resourcefulness, he fashioned fishing tools from parts of the raft and caught fish with his bare hands. He also collected rainwater to stay hydrated and used the raft's canopy for shelter from the sun during the day. 

Over the course of his journey, he drifted more than 2,000 miles until he was rescued by a Brazilian fishing boat. By then, he had lost over 40 pounds.

The original arms deal, first reported in early November, was meant to secure the release of seven American hostages in Lebanon but violated U.S. policies, including the arms embargo against Iran and President Reagan‚Äôs pledge not to negotiate with terrorists. A few weeks later, it was disclosed that the funds from these sales were used to support the Contras, which directly violated the 1982 Boland Amendment prohibiting U.S. aid for overthrowing Nicaragua's government.

In the wake of this revelation, President Reagan accepted responsibility for the arms-for-hostages deal but denied knowledge of the funds diversion. A special prosecutor was appointed to investigate, and televised hearings followed, finding that officials attempted to cover up their illegal actions. They concluded that while Reagan and Vice President George Bush didn‚Äôt break the law, their actions contributed to a broader effort to deceive Congress and the public.",en,Tweet,2,37,7,2,3505.0,2024-11-25 12:36:26,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdOxbMOWsAANW6-.jpg

The ""first"" Thanksgiving was held by the Pilgrims in 1621 at Plymouth, where they feasted to thank God for their harvest, inviting the Wampanoag tribe to join them. While this event was not repeated annually, similar observances occurred in other colonies and to celebrate victories in battle. In 1789, President George Washington proclaimed November 26 as a national day of thanksgiving to celebrate the creation of the United States and its new Constitution. Washington personally marked the day by attending church services and making charitable donations.

However, Washington‚Äôs proclamation did not establish Thanksgiving as a permanent federal holiday.

Congresswoman Luna‚Äôs resolution also condemns all threats of violence in every form.

""The escalating threats of violence and death against Congresswoman Nancy Mace on social media and to her office are awful and completely unacceptable. This has become standard practice among those on the other side towards those they disagree with,"" said Congresswoman Luna.

Too many companies profit from adult content reaching children, and it‚Äôs going to stop. 

First, this bill creates a private right of action for parents and guardians against app stores that expose their children to pornographic content and extreme violence. 

That means these companies can be sued. 

App stores can protect themselves from liability by enforcing age verification and parental controls. 

We have the technology to ensure age-verification without ending anonymity online or endangering First Amendment rights, and we should use it. 
 
Younger and younger children are seeing sexual and violent content online through a variety of apps.
