"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1846902415502586262',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1978, President Jimmy Carter officially restores the full citizenship rights of Jefferson Davis, the former president of the Confederacy, effectively resolving a century-long debate. 

Davis is primarily remembered alongside General Robert E. Lee, who had his citizenship restored by Congress in 1976. The congressional resolution acknowledged Davis's significant contributions, noting his service as a soldier, U.S. Congressman, and Secretary of War. It stated that restoring his citizenship completed the reconciliation process that followed the Civil War, emphasizing the need to reunite the nation after its divisive conflict.

Davis's path to citizenship restoration was complicated by the 14th Amendment, which barred former Confederates from holding public office unless Congress intervened. Although he was indicted for treason after the war, the charges were ultimately dismissed when President Andrew Johnson issued a general pardon in 1868. This pardon restored civil rights but did not grant the right to hold office.

In the 1870s, discussions arose about potentially allowing Davis to run for Senate, but he was specifically excluded from an 1876 universal amnesty bill that restored citizenship rights to most former Confederates. Davis‚Äôs refusal to seek a pardon was rooted in his belief that he had not acted wrongfully, famously stating, ‚Äúrepentance must precede the right of pardon.‚Äù

Before his leadership in the Confederacy, Davis was a highly respected U.S. senator from Mississippi. His resignation speech in 1861, delivered as Mississippi prepared to secede, was a dramatic moment in the lead-up to the Civil War. In it, he expressed hope for peaceful relations while asserting the right to leave the Union, evoking strong emotions among his colleagues.

The restoration of Davis's citizenship by Carter not only acknowledged his historical role but also highlighted the ongoing complexities of reconciling the legacies of the Civil War and its leaders in American history.",en,Tweet,3,52,5,11,3644.0,2024-10-17 14:13:44,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaGD9REWEAA12d4.jpg

Justice has once again been served by the brave men and women of the Israeli military. Yahya Sinwar, the vile, disgusting person who orchestrated the October 7th massacre, is dead. Sinwar‚Äôs life was the embodiment of evil and marked by hatred for all that is good in the world. His death brings hope for all those who seek to live in freedom, and relief to Israelis he has sought to oppress.

Let this be a reminder to Hamas and all those who were involved in the October 7th attacks: you may try to terrorize and intimidate, but those who live under the banner of freedom will never surrender. The eternal flame of liberty and the faith of the Jewish people will never be snuffed out by the darkness of barbarism and the cruelty of antisemitism.

Still, the death of this man is not the end of Israel‚Äôs fight for survival. At this moment, with the bloodthirsty leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah now gone, the Biden-Harris Administration must now work in tandem with Israel to apply a maximum pressure campaign against the head of the snake: Iran. Despite the Biden-Harris Administration condemning his strategies, Prime Minister Netanyahu has produced multiple watershed victories for Israel such that we are on the precipice of a new day of security and freedom in the Middle East. We cannot let this moment go to waste.

Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson Demands Immediate
Stay of Execution for #RobertRoberson

Washington, D.C. ‚Äì Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson today called for an immediate stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who is scheduled to be executed in Texas. Congressman Jackson emphasized the urgent need for a thorough review of Roberson's case, citing significant concerns about the fairness of his trial and the evidence used to convict him.

""Robert Roberson's case raises serious questions about the integrity of our justice system,"" said Congressman Jackson. ""We cannot allow an execution to proceed when there are substantial doubts about the validity of the conviction. It is imperative that we ensure every individual receives a fair trial and that justice is truly served.""

Congressman Jackson highlighted several key issues in Roberson's case, including the use of outdated and discredited forensic science, as well as the lack of adequate legal representation. He urged the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Governor Greg Abbott to grant a stay of execution and allow for a comprehensive review of the case.

""Our justice system must be based on fairness and accuracy,"" Congressman Jackson continued. ""Executing Robert Roberson without addressing these critical concerns would be a grave miscarriage of justice. I implore the authorities to halt this execution and ensure that justice is upheld.""

Congressman Jackson remains committed to advocating for justice and fairness in the criminal justice system and will continue to fight for the rights of those who have been wrongfully convicted.

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1847238588414492993',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1867, the U.S. officially acquired Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million, equivalent to less than two cents per acre. 

The territory, inhabited by Indigenous peoples for thousands of years, spanned 586,412 square miles‚Äîabout twice the size of Texas‚Äîand was promoted by Secretary of State William Henry Seward.

Russia sought to sell the remote territory to avoid losing it in a potential conflict with Great Britain. Despite public skepticism, which led to derisive names like ‚ÄúSeward‚Äôs Folly,‚Äù negotiations between Seward and Russian minister Eduard de Stoeckl began in March 1867. Public disapproval was partly fueled by President Andrew Johnson's unpopularity, especially following his impeachment in 1868. Ultimately, Congress approved the purchase.

Alaska was under U.S. Army control until June 1877, after which it was briefly governed by the Treasury Department and various military authorities. Most Russians in the territory returned to Russia after the sale, and those who stayed had the option to apply for U.S. citizenship within three years, though most eventually departed. A civil government was established in May 1884 when Alaska became a district.

Public sentiment shifted positively after gold was discovered in Nome, Alaska, in 1899, igniting a gold rush. Alaska became the 49th state on January 3, 1959, and is now known for its rich natural resources, supplying a significant portion of the U.S. oil and seafood.",en,Tweet,3,24,7,4,2697.0,2024-10-18 12:29:34,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaK1tJIWUAAPt9g.jpg

Today, we shine a spotlight on an extraordinary man who has spent his life demonstrating the values of character, service, and generosity. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero‚Äî93-year-old U.S. Army veteran Robert Heath of New Hope.
 
Bob answered the call to serve during the Korean War, but his commitment to service only deepened once he returned home. For nearly 40 years, ‚ÄúPop-Pop Heath,"" as the community knows him, has been a steadfast presence at New Hope-Solebury School District sporting events. With his camera in hand, he captures priceless moments on the field, transforming them into keepsake DVDs that young athletes can cherish long after the last whistle blows. As Bob says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs old school,‚Äù but there is something invaluable about giving someone a tangible piece of their journey to carry with them forever.
 
But Bob‚Äôs influence goes far beyond the camera lens. He has been a mentor, a role model, and an unwavering cheerleader‚Äînot just for his children, grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren, but for every student who takes the field. Bob has become ‚ÄúPop-Pop‚Äù to generations of athletes, offering more than just encouragement‚Äîhe provides a steady presence that builds confidence, instills values, and fosters a sense of family and belonging. 
 
In yet another remarkable act of service, Bob established a scholarship fund to reward New Hope-Solebury athletes who demonstrate character, sportsmanship, and integrity and inspire future generations to live by these same principles. In a particularly fitting tribute, the New Hope-Solubury Athletic Hall of Fame was dedicated and renamed the New Hope-Solebury Robert. D Heath ""Pop-Pop Heath"" Athletic Hall of Fame in his honor, ensuring his legacy of kindness, dedication, and community spirit will continue to inspire our community for years to come. 
 
Bob is the embodiment of living a life with purpose, kindness, and compassion. His ""old-school"" gesture is an act of profound generosity and offers something deeper: a meaningful gift of memories and the invaluable connection of family. Through decades of dedication, he has quietly built a legacy of community spirit, reminding us that small gestures, given with heart, create lasting bonds.
 
Please join me in honoring Robert ‚ÄúPop-Pop‚Äù Heath‚Äîa veteran, mentor, and hero who represents the very best of our community and continues to inspire us through his selfless service, boundless joy, and compassionate spirit.",en,Tweet,0,3,0,11,684.0,2024-10-18 17:35:04,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaL7oLaXAAAiJd4.jpg

The USS Constitution, known as Old Ironsides, is a historic three-masted wooden frigate of the U.S. Navy and the oldest commissioned naval warship still afloat. Launched in 1797, she was one of six frigates built under the Naval Act of 1794 to serve as a capital ship for the young Navy. Constructed in a Boston shipyard, her early missions included protecting American merchant ships during the Quasi-War with France and combating Barbary pirates.

Most famous for her role in the War of 1812, the Constitution captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five British warships, earning her the nickname ""Old Ironsides."" After the war, she served in various capacities, including as a flagship in the Mediterranean and as a training ship during the Civil War. Notably, she circled the globe in the 1840s.

Retired from active duty in 1881, the Constitution became a museum ship in 1907. She completed a national tour in 1934 and sailed under her own power for her bicentennial in 1997 and again in 2012 to commemorate her victory over the Guerriere.

Today, the Constitution's mission is to educate the public about the Navy's role in history through outreach, demonstrations, and participation in events. She is crewed by active-duty Navy personnel, who conduct tours and ceremonies while she is docked at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston.",en,Tweet,0,68,10,9,3106.0,2024-10-21 12:04:48,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaaMzm6WIAAkocj.jpg

Floyd had been designated Public Enemy No. 1 due to his alleged involvement in the Kansas City Massacre, where three policemen and an FBI agent were shot during a chaotic attempt to capture an escaped federal prisoner.

His criminal career began at a young age, starting with a $350 post-office robbery when he was just 18. After a three-year stint in the St. Louis underworld, he landed in Missouri Penitentiary for a payroll robbery, After his release, he partnered with ‚ÄúRed‚Äù Lovett and spent the next four years robbing rural banks, often changing partners as they fell victim to violence or capture.

Public perception of Floyd diverged sharply from the FBI‚Äôs portrayal. While the agency labeled him a ruthless killer‚ÄîTIME magazine described him as ‚Äúa murderously cool shot‚Äù responsible for at least six deaths‚Äîmany saw him as a tragic figure, a poor Oklahoma tenant farmer turned outlaw due to financial desperation. Rumors suggested he destroyed mortgage notes during his bank heists, helping struggling farmers escape foreclosure. He had a reputation of generosity, supporting families in hiding from the law, providing food and aid to those in need.
