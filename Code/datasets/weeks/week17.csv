With the wisdom and magnificent leadership of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, our nation has been graced by four historic years of progress, hope and unity for American families.  

Tonight, President Biden delivered his farewell address to a nation that is stronger because of his leadership.¬† In doing so, he honored the vision of founders, the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and the aspirations of our children.

With deep experience and with global relationships that are rivaled by none, President Biden has masterfully led America on the world stage.¬† 

Under President Biden‚Äôs visionary leadership, America has been unequivocal in our commitment to defending Democracy here at home and around the world ‚Äì and our NATO alliance is stronger and more unified than ever.¬† 

America was fortunate to have a strong, steady, wise commander-in-chief honoring and promoting American values in the global arena.

President Biden and Vice President Harris, with the partnership of Democrats in Congress, have built a towering legacy of extraordinary achievement for the American people.¬† 

They pulled our nation from the depths of the pandemic and ignited the strongest economic recovery in the world with our American Rescue Plan.¬† 

They seized a once-in-a-century chance to rebuild our nation while investing in our middle class with our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.¬† 

With our CHIPS and Science Act, they declared America‚Äôs economic independence: powering a manufacturing boom, driving decades of scientific discovery and creating good-paying jobs across the country.¬† 

They enacted America's first major gun violence prevention legislation in nearly three decades with our Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and took a monumental step toward fully honoring the service and sacrifice of our heroes in uniform with our PACT Act.¬† 

With our Inflation Reduction Act, they honored our moral responsibility to save the planet while bringing down costs for working families by lowering prescription drug prices and energy bills.¬† 

And our Respect for Marriage Act was a triumph of love, liberty and justice for all.

President Biden and Vice President Harris have earned their place in the pantheon of American democracy.¬† 

Every American can be proud of the leadership and dignity they brought to the White House ‚Äì and tonight, we again saw President Biden's great respect for America's remarkable history.¬†

His reign saw Russia's transformation from a medieval state to a growing empire, but at a great cost to its people and economy. He enacted reforms, including a new legal code, local self-government, the creation of Russia‚Äôs first standing army, and built relations with Europe. 

Ivan later became more autocratic, purging the nobility through his secret police. His later years were marked by violence. Though often seen as intelligent and devout, Ivan was also prone to extreme paranoia and violent outbursts.

Right now, terrorists, rogue regimes, and foreign state-actors are rapidly developing new ways to exploit and harm America‚Äôs national interests, and it‚Äôs our responsibility to ensure intelligence agencies remain three steps ahead of our enemies. And now, more than ever, leaks and indiscretions by misguided intelligence staff can endanger Americans and hinder our ability to predict and prevent attacks. Everyone on the Committee and within the IC must be devoted to secrecy regarding the material we review. The lives of our covert agents in the field, and the security of our homeland, depend on it.

The Committee has a unique opportunity to work toward rebuilding our intelligence apparatus so that our IC is focused on the challenges of today and is prepared for the threats of tomorrow. It is our aim to rebuild relationships with our partners in the Western Hemisphere, address issues with the development of IC assessments, determine which intelligence tools are needed to protect Americans, and provide our brave men and women in the U.S. intelligence services with the support they need. In our age of increasing threats from abroad and bloated bureaucracy at home, the Committee will be committed to preventing enemies‚Äô attacks and upholding the privacy rights of all American citizens.

I want to thank Chairman Turner for his work in the 118th Congress. He led our committee ably and admirably, at a time when there was a distinct need for a steady hand. He is a valued member of our Conference, and I will build from the solid base his leadership provided this committee.",en,Tweet,19,272,58,0,85573.0,2025-01-16 20:03:51,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

The reality is that, in its final days in office, the Biden-Harris Administration is doing everything it can to coddle and appease the regime in Havana. It is a betrayal of the Cuban people struggling for freedom to throw a lifeline to their oppressors.

Today, we celebrate a man whose unwavering dedication, courageous leadership, and boundless compassion have shaped the very fabric of our community. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero: Lower Makefield Police Chief Ken Coluzzi.
 
From the moment he fulfilled his dream of becoming a police officer in 1978, Ken Coluzzi dedicated himself to protecting and serving others. Over the next 48 years, his career became a masterclass in law enforcement, marked by integrity, determination, and an unrelenting pursuit of justice. Rising through the ranks of the Philadelphia Police Department, he commanded elite investigative units and tackled some of the city‚Äôs most challenging and high-profile cases. His work‚Äîon cases such as the ‚ÄúBoy in the Box‚Äù cold case, the Center City Rapist, and the Pier 34 collapse‚Äînot only brought closure to families but also demonstrated his steadfast commitment to truth and fairness.

Then, in 2000, we welcomed Ken to our Lower Makefield Community to serve as police chief. Throughout his 24 years of service in our community, Chief Coluzzi worked tirelessly to transform the department, expanding its ranks, professionalizing its operations, and fostering a culture rooted in fairness and trust. Under his leadership, the department achieved Pennsylvania State Accreditation and set a gold standard for excellence. His advocacy to equip our local first responders with Narcan has helped to save 42 lives in Lower Makefield alone and has become a model for departments across Bucks County.

Chief Coluzzi‚Äôs impact has extended far beyond his badge; he has served as a source of strength and compassion during times of tragedy and triumph alike. From supporting families affected by 9/11 to advocating for vulnerable members of our community and fostering strong police-community relations, his leadership was defined not just by his ability to protect but his commitment to building trust, unity, and a sense of belonging.
 
As Chief Coluzzi steps into a well-deserved retirement, he leaves behind a legacy that is both profound and enduring. His dedication has touched every corner of Lower Makefield, and made our community not only safer, but truly better.

Chief, on behalf of our entire community, thank you for your remarkable contributions, congratulations on an extraordinary career, and best wishes for a retirement as fulfilling as the legacy you leave behind!",en,Tweet,0,4,1,2,822.0,2025-01-17 17:20:44,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhguwUrWoAAJx0d.jpg

President Trump was elected with a mandate, and Republicans in Congress must rapidly work towards fulfilling that mandate.

D.O.G.E. is a vital part of President Trump's mandate, and my brand-new subcommittee will work hand-in-hand with President Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and their entire team to create a government that actually works for the American people.

Waste, fraud, mismanagement, and abuse plague the federal government everywhere, from the Social Security Administration to local post offices serving Northwest Georgians.

Government doesn‚Äôt have to run this way.

If something as appalling as employees not showing up to work is unacceptable in the private sector, why should it be allowed in government?

House Leadership and the Sergeant at Arms have informed us that as a result of this change, ticketed guests will NOT be able to attend the ceremonies in person. The 60th Inaugural Ceremonies tickets are now considered commemorative memorabilia.

I support the legislation requiring new ownership for TikTok that is not connected to the CCP.¬†

I know the app is popular, but the business model allows the CCP to sit on the parent company‚Äôs board.¬†

When the Communist Party speaks, everyone who does business with them follows their demands.¬†

@SenTomCotton and @SenatorRicketts are right to make sure that the terms of the statute requiring qualified divestiture are followed and any attempt to purchase TikTok by an American owner also must comply with statutory requirements.¬†

I share President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs goal of keeping the app available to Americans who enjoy the content, but our national security interests have to be met before that can be achieved. ByteDance, TikTok‚Äôs parent company, has been arrogant regarding the requirement to sell.¬†

STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN‚ÄôS PREEMPTIVE PARDONS FOR THE ENTIRE BIDEN FAMILY:

‚ÄúPresident Biden‚Äôs preemptive pardons for the Biden Crime Family serve as a confession of their corruption as they sold out the American people to enrich themselves. Our investigation revealed that at least ten members of the Biden Crime Family and their associates raked in over $30 million by selling Joe Biden‚Äôs influence to corrupt foreign entities and individuals in China, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Kazakhstan. The legacy media should be ashamed of themselves for covering up Joe Biden and his family‚Äôs abuse of power, corruption, and obstruction. The American people have seen through the legacy media‚Äôs coverup and the Bidens‚Äô lies, and they know the truth: President Biden abused his public office to create a slush fund for his family. President Biden will go down as the most corrupt president in U.S. history, and our investigation will be remembered as one of the most successful ever conducted by Congress.‚Äù",en,Tweet,444,10201,4066,851,220502.0,2025-01-20 17:01:52,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

There are many challenges facing our country, and we must find a way to tackle them. I am ready to partner with my Republican colleagues on any issue where we can find common ground.

To bring down costs, to build housing, and to create more jobs. To address the crime that is affecting so many and to fix an economy that seems to work best for those at the very top and big corporations. To protect our freedoms, increase opportunity for our families, and shore up our standing around the globe. 

And to secure necessary aid to help California recover and rebuild from this month‚Äôs tragic wildfires.

I am clear-eyed about the challenges we may face. Our differences can feel extreme at times. And California, I will never back down when our rights are threatened, our values are under attack, or our communities are demonized.

But what unites us as a country is far more important than what divides us. 

We are all in this great enterprise we call America together, and we must succeed together or surely we will fail together.

I commend President Biden and Vice President Harris for their steadfast leadership, grace, and commitment to ensuring a peaceful transition of power, which is a cornerstone of our democracy. Their administration has worked tirelessly to build a more inclusive and representative nation, and we must continue to build on their progress to restore trust in our democracy, expand opportunity, and improve the lives of all Americans.

To that end, I am committed to working with those who share the goals of lowering costs for everyday Americans, protecting our communities, and advancing the common good. While I will always seek common ground, I will stand firm against the rise of far-right extremism that threatens the safety and well-being of the American people.

Most Americans can find common ground because there is more that unites us than divides us. I strongly believe that more people have faith in the good of our country, and it is our ability to harness this hope and work toward the common good that will strengthen our nation.

Our country is great because of our democracy ‚Äì and our diversity.

Louis, who became king in 1774, struggled with the financial crisis inherited from his grandfather. In 1789, he convened the States-General to address the crisis, but the commoner declared itself the National Assembly, sparking the French Revolution. 

Though he initially accepted the revolution, Louis resisted reforms and supported reactionary elements, including his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1789, a mob forced the royal family to move to Paris, and the king and queen tried to flee to Austria but were captured. Louis was then reduced to a symbolic monarch under the 1791 constitution. The next year, the monarchy was abolished, and Louis was arrested. 

In November, evidence of his treasonous dealings with Austria emerged, leading to his trial and conviction for treason. Nine months later, Marie Antoinette was also convicted of treason and executed.",en,Tweet,2,26,7,45,18871.0,2025-01-21 12:01:51,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gh0MIOmXQAILnHY.jpg
