These institutions are statutorily authorized to receive federal support from the Department to strengthen their capacity to serve Native students, and rely on this federal support to adequately serve all enrolled students. 

I am working with my colleagues to reinforce to the administration that these are statutory grant programs authorized and appropriated by Congress that align with the President‚Äôs goal of providing career technical education to the next generation for high-impact workforce needs such as fisheries, healthcare, skilled trades, and energy. As Alaska partners with this administration on several large-scale and exciting projects that can help transform our state, we need a local workforce trained to meet this moment. Cancelling these funds takes us further away from that objective.

His bombing spree began in 1978, starting with an un-mailed package that injured a security guard. Over the next several years, Kaczynski mailed homemade pipe bombs to various targets, including executives at American and United Airlines and academic administrators, resulting in several injuries. The violence led to the death of a computer store owner in California. Ultimately, the Unabomber carried out 14 attacks with 16 bombs.

Kaczynski promised to halt his attacks if his manifesto was published in full by a major outlet. In his manifesto, Kaczynski contended that technology had distanced humans from nature. He advocated for a return to ‚Äúwild nature,‚Äù arguing that this necessitated an end to all scientific research.

"Bell, Wesley",Representative,Missouri,1,Democratic,House: 2025-Present,Yes,RepWesleyBellMO,'1969059928879874135',"The assassination of Charlie Kirk was an act of horrific political violence, and I condemn it without hesitation. My heart goes out to his wife, his children, and all who loved him. No family should ever endure this kind of tragedy. Political violence is a sickness that eats away at democracy and tears at the fabric of our society, and we must reject it in all its forms.

But condemning political violence does not require rewriting history. Mr. Kirk used his platform to demean, to divide, and to dehumanize many of the very people I represent. To honor his ‚Äòlife and legacy‚Äô in the congressional record would be to dishonor my constituents whose dignity he denied.

This work reaches far beyond Northern Ireland. It speaks to our shared heritage, strengthens transatlantic ties, and offers a beacon of hope for divided societies everywhere.

If a mom wants to get a lifesaving hepatitis B vaccine to protect her newborn, she should be able to get it.

Children‚Äôs health should be the top priority. We must ensure that any vaccine recommendation protects patient choice and never takes away families‚Äô access to safe, effective vaccines.

Today, we honor a man who has devoted his life to protecting and strengthening Newtown Township. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero‚Äî Fire Chief Glenn Forsyth.
 
Chief Forsyth‚Äôs story is woven into the fabric of Newtown itself. A lifelong resident, he grew up in a family where fire service wasn‚Äôt just a duty ‚Äî it was a tradition. His grandfather joined the Newtown Fire Association in 1915, his father and uncles followed, and in 1975, Glenn followed their footsteps, stepping up to become a junior firefighter. From that day forward, service wasn‚Äôt something he did; it became who he is.
 
Over the past five decades, he rose through the ranks of the Newtown Fire Association, serving as president, trustee, battalion chief, and safety officer, before being appointed in 2012 as Newtown Township‚Äôs first full-time fire chief, entrusted with leading and modernizing the department. Along the way, he mentored generations of firefighters and helped transform the department into the cornerstone of public safety it is today. This year marks not only his 50th year with the Newtown Fire Association but also his 47th year of service to Newtown Township, including 28 years with the police department. Through it all, he has been the very definition of a hometown public servant--dependable, humble, and devoted to his neighbors.
 
Through every chapter of his career, Chief Forsyth has been a steady presence‚Äîon the scene of emergencies, at community events, and behind the scenes, quietly improving safety, training, and preparedness. He has spent his life making his neighbors safer, his community stronger, and the Fire Association ready to serve the next generation.
 
Chief Forsyth‚Äôs career is more than a record of service‚Äîit‚Äôs a testament to his remarkable character. Please join me in thanking Chief Forsyth for 50 years of selfless service, leadership, and dedication to our community. Chief, we congratulate you on this incredible milestone and are proud to call you a true hometown hero!",en,Tweet,0,5,0,4,1117.0,2025-09-19 18:14:56,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1Oa5zTWoAIylOk.jpg

Rosecrans aimed to drive the Confederates out of Chattanooga. In early September, he consolidated his forces and pushed Bragg's army south.

Bragg sought to retake Chattanooga, intending to strike Rosecrans‚Äôs isolated troops. A miscommunication led Rosecrans to create an actual gap in his defenses, which Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet exploited, resulting in a rout of Union forces. The Union ultimately retreated to Chattanooga, while the Confederates took control of the surrounding heights, besieging the city.

We are not simply mourning the loss of a conservative leader, we are observing the emergence of a new generation of American patriots who understand that the future of our republic now rests in their hands.

Charlie Kirk demonstrated what becomes possible when one individual refuses to surrender their convictions to the forces of political correctness and cultural decay. He possessed the moral clarity to speak uncomfortable truths when others remained silent. He had the courage to stand firm when others retreated. He inspired millions of Americans to reclaim their voice, defend their values, and fight for their country. And the young leaders who carry his torch today understand that failure is not an option.

The radical left and their allies in the establishment better understand this: what Charlie built cannot be torn down by cancel culture, cannot be destroyed by media attacks, and cannot be defeated by political persecution. It is built on the solid foundation of faith in God, commitment to truth, and love of country.

Charlie understood what too many in Washington have forgotten‚Äîthat politics is not about personal ambition or partisan advantage. Politics is about preserving the constitutional principles that made America exceptional. Politics is about ensuring that our children inherit a nation where freedom still means something.

His message was clear and uncompromising: Build strong families. Raise patriotic children. Defend our institutions. Pass down our values. Choose principle over convenience, truth over popularity, courage over comfort.

That is Charlie Kirk's enduring legacy. That is the foundation upon which the next generation of conservative leaders will stand.

Today we honor a patriot. Tomorrow we continue his work.

"Cole, Tom",Representative,Oklahoma,4,Republican,House: 2003-Present,Yes,TomColeOK04,'1969926147040256085',"Today, a memorial service was held for Charlie Kirk in Arizona. Following the service, I released the following statement: 
¬†
Charlie Kirk was a good man. He was a dedicated Christian, who allowed his faith to guide him in all he did. He was a true patriot who loved the United States of America with all his heart. He believed in strong family values and was a devoted husband to his wife, Erika, and father to his two children. He was a leader and mentor to many with the talented ability to connect with the American people, particularly the youth, through his public speaking skills and successful conservative nonprofit, Turning Point USA.
¬†
Charlie believed in the importance of civil discourse and public debate. When Charlie visited college campuses, he was not there to give speeches and presentations. Instead, he was there to respectfully take questions from students ‚Äì no matter what side of the political aisle they were on ‚Äì and try to find understanding of one another. In fact, I was looking forward to welcoming Charlie to my district this fall, as he was scheduled to be at the University of Oklahoma in Norman on October 16. Now, we unfortunately won‚Äôt get that opportunity.
¬†
Yet, it was in this exact setting, while he was in the literal act of public dialogue, that Charlie was assassinated. It is just sick, tragic, and harrowing. It fills me with grief, not only for his family, friends, and Turning Point USA colleagues, but for our entire nation, as political violence of any kind is never acceptable and, quite frankly, is un-American.
¬†
I have full faith in Director Kash Patel, the FBI, and Utah law enforcement as they actively work to bring justice to Charlie Kirk. However, we, as Americans, should also honor his legacy by engaging in genuine civil debate with those on the other side of the aisle, allowing faith and strong family values to guide us in our lives daily, spreading Charlie‚Äôs strong conservative message, and by coming together as a nation to fight back against the evil that exists in this country.
¬†
I am confident that we will overcome this dark chapter. In the meantime, please join me in praying for the soul of Charlie Kirk, his family, his friends, his fans, and our country. May Charlie Kirk rest in peace.",en,Tweet,7,193,19,13,15749.0,2025-09-22 01:46:07,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

President Erdoƒüan has openly aligned himself with Vladimir Putin, purchasing the Russian S-400 missile system and remaining the only NATO ally to not impose sanctions on Russia, while also supporting Iran, hosting Hamas leadership, and threatening to invade Israel. Turkey continues its aggression in the Mediterranean region, illegally occupying Cyprus and conducting illegal overflights above Greek islands.¬†

This is not the behavior of an ally. Unfortunately, Turkey has too often acted more like an adversary and handing¬†over America‚Äôs most advanced stealth fighter jets to a government that works with Moscow and Tehran while embracing terrorists would be reckless and dangerous.

For half a century, Post 667 has been a pillar of honor, service, and fellowship, providing veterans with support, strengthening families, and instilling the values of duty and patriotism in future generations.

As your U.S. Representative, I remain committed to ensuring our veterans receive the care and resources they deserve. I was proud to cosponsor the PACT Act, now law, which expands healthcare benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances. I also supported the Disabled Veterans Housing Support Act, which passed in the House, to ensure disabled veterans are not unfairly disqualified from housing assistance. This year‚Äôs appropriations bill includes billions for veterans programs, from housing and childcare to mental health services and support for homeless veterans.

I want to thank American Legion Post 667 for 50 years of sacrifice, fellowship, and devotion to community. Congratulations on this historic milestone, and may the next 50 years continue to bring strength, service, and unity to Universal City and beyond. üá∫üá∏",en,Tweet,0,0,0,1,375.0,2025-09-22 21:22:07,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1eiik6WAAEba5S.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1eiik7X0AAblsP.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1eiikzW8AAl-6N.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1eiikrW8AAqZzZ.jpg"

But Schumer and the Democrats would rather shut the government down than give up a single dollar of their failed agenda. They want to gut the $50 billion rural health fund.

From his early years of military service in the United States Air Force to his long tenure on the Webb County Commissioners‚Äô Court as Justice of the Peace, Judge Martinez dedicated himself to public service with integrity and purpose.

Beyond the courtroom, Judge Martinez was a successful entrepreneur and a committed community leader. As President of LULAC Council 12 and through his work with local schools, he championed opportunity, justice, and programs that gave young people the tools to succeed. His efforts strengthened both civic life and educational opportunities across South Texas.

In every sense, Judge Martinez lived out his faith and commitment to others. His legacy of service will continue to inspire future generations in Laredo and beyond. My deepest condolences are with the Martinez family as we celebrate his remarkable life.
