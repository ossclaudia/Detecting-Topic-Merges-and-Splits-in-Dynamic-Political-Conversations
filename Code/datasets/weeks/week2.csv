Since 1945, Germany had been divided into an eastern Communist zone and a western Allied-controlled zone, symbolizing the Cold War's tensions. Key events, like the Berlin Blockade (1948-1949) and the wall's construction in 1961, highlighted this division. As Soviet power declined in the late 1980s, the East German Communist Party weakened, leading to mass emigration and the wall's eventual dismantling in late 1989. Reunification talks followed, involving officials from both German states and major Allied powers. Just two months later, Germany held its first all-German elections, resulting in Helmut Kohl becoming the first chancellor of a reunified nation. 

Although the Soviet Union would not dissolve for over a year, many viewed Germany's reunification as a pivotal moment signaling the Cold War's end.",en,Tweet,1,27,7,12,9617.0,2024-10-03 12:23:55,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY9kkLhWAAAnRQQ.jpg

G7 leaders  ‚Äì  led by President Biden ‚Äì are urging Israel to have a proportional and limited response against the Iranian regime.

Apparently the G7 views Iran as a normal nation. It is not.

I have been working with President Biden and his team for over a year and a half to achieve normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel ‚Äì building on the Abraham Accords brokered by President Trump.  This would be a historic shift in the Middle East. I believe the October 7 attack by Hamas  ‚Äì  financed and supported by Iran  ‚Äì  was designed to stop this process. I will continue to push for normalization.

When it comes to Iran, the regime is a theocracy dedicated to destroying the Jewish state, driving the west out of the Middle East, and stopping reconciliation between the Arab world and Israel. The Ayatollah is a religious Nazi. Iran is not trying to build peaceful nuclear power plants. The regime is trying to build a nuclear bomb to achieve its religious objectives. If you don‚Äôt understand that, you‚Äôre not listening to what Iran is saying and you‚Äôre not watching what they are doing throughout the world.

For the sake of our friends in Israel, we cannot allow the world to miscalculate Iran, just as it did with Hitler and the Nazis.

I truly believe if Iran had a nuclear weapon, the Ayatollah would use it against Israel.

The idea of telling Israel what targets to strike ignores reality and is the mentality that existed in the 1930‚Äôs.

Would a proportional response be launching 200 ballistic missiles from Israel into Iran, mimicking what the Iranians did to Israel?

To my friends in Israel, one holocaust directed at the Jewish people is enough. Do what you have to do to defend yourselves against those who would kill you simply because you are Jewish.

During my meeting with President Biden, I stressed that the federal government‚Äôs response to hurricanes over the last two years has left too many Floridians, especially our farmers, hurting and with unmet needs ‚Äì and this must be fixed NOW. It is going to take local, state and federal efforts to help communities recover along the Gulf Coast.

This aid has been routinely provided to victims of hurricanes in the past but that has not been the case since Hurricanes Ian, Debby and Idalia and that must change so we can deliver this aid NOW.

Hurricane Helene devastated communities along hundreds of miles of Florida‚Äôs Gulf Coast and caused unimaginable damage and loss in Taylor County and across the Big Bend.

Se necesitar√°n esfuerzos locales, estatales y federales para ayudar a las comunidades a recuperarse a lo largo de la Costa del Golfo. Por eso he exigido que el l√≠der de la mayor√≠a Chuck Schumer vuelva a convocar de inmediato al Senado una vez que FEMA y SBA finalicen las evaluaciones de da√±os para que podamos financiar por completo a estas agencias, al USDA y a otras que responden a este desastre con un proyecto de ley de asignaciones suplementarias para desastres. Luchar√© para entregar ayuda a nuestro estado y garantizar una gu√≠a de remoci√≥n de escombros para nuestras comunidades locales, e inst√© a los funcionarios federales hoy a que pongan a los floridanos y a todos los estadounidenses de primero.

The satellite launched from the Tyuratam launch base in Kazakhstan. Weighing 184 pounds and measuring 22 inches in diameter, Sputnik orbited Earth every hour and 36 minutes at a speed of 18,000 miles per hour. It transmitted radio signals that could be received by amateur radio operators in the U.S., sparking both fascination and concern over Soviet technological advancements.

Launched to coincide with the International Geophysical Year, Sputnik‚Äôs success prompted fears in the U.S. about potential military applications of Soviet rocket technology, especially as it was significantly larger than the planned U.S. satellite, Explorer, which launched in January of 1958. The launch of Sputnik marked the beginning of the space race, as the U.S. government and military scrambled to catch up.

In the following years, the Soviet Union achieved several space milestones, including the first living being in orbit, the first human in space, and numerous other firsts. However, the U.S. made a significant leap in 1969 with the Apollo 11 mission, successfully landing astronauts on the moon.",en,Tweet,0,20,3,4,4307.0,2024-10-04 13:22:19,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZC7hjPWYAA-HVn.jpg

Today, it is with immense pride that we shine a spotlight on an extraordinary group of women whose legacy has not only shaped our past but continues to inspire our future. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Heroes‚Äîthe incredible women of PA-1 who answered our nation‚Äôs call as Rosie the Riveters during World War II.
 
When our country needed them most, these women‚Äîour mothers, grandmothers, sisters, and neighbors‚Äîrose to the occasion with unshakable courage and conviction. They rolled up their sleeves and got to work on factory floors, shipyards, and munitions plants, pouring their energy and spirit into the war effort. With every bolt tightened and every rivet placed, they laid the foundation for the America we know today, breaking down barriers, shattering stereotypes, and opening doors for future generations. The Rosies of PA-1 embodied the spirit of resilience, determination, and patriotism, showing the world that strength knows no bounds.
 
For far too long, their immense contributions went unrecognized, which is why I introduced the Rosie the Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act‚Äîsigned into law in 2020‚Äîto ensure these trailblazers, who taught us all what We Can Do It truly means, received the long overdue honor they so richly deserve. 
 
This past weekend, I hosted a ceremony in our community to honor our remarkable Rosies. Surrounded by their families, we presented them with Congressional Gold Medals, citations, and American flags flown over the U.S. Capitol. It was a day filled with joy, reverence, and heartfelt remembrance. It was the honor of a lifetime to celebrate with our living Rosies, Rita Colella, Dorothy Trate, Michaeline Kryven, and Mae Krier, as well as with the families of the Rosies no longer with us: Pauline Biedka, Angela Calabrese, Virginia DiMaggio, Sarah Eglinger, Marion G. Gelb, Eunice Pearl Heath, Beverly Jean O‚ÄôBradovic, Angelina Romello, Barbara Roth, Alice K. Schafer, Mary Schaefer Simmons, Ann Meredith Smith, Eleanor Sladko Stern, Rose Sutor, and Doris Wiley McNichol. 
 
These PA-1 women didn‚Äôt just contribute to a war effort‚Äîthey forged a path for generations of women to follow. Their efforts ensured the torch of liberty would continue to burn bright, and their example inspires us to meet the challenges of our own time with the same resolve, determination, and love of country. The indomitable Rosies of Bucks and Montgomery Counties continue to remind us that when we come together with a shared purpose, there is no challenge we cannot overcome.
 
Please join me in celebrating these extraordinary women, thanking them for their sacrifice, their trailblazing spirit, and their enduring impact. The Rosies of PA-1 define what it means to be true Hometown Heroes, and their legacies will be forever etched into the history of our community and great nation.",en,Tweet,0,1,0,4,676.0,2024-10-04 17:05:20,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZDukHtWQAAD3XL.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZDukHrXQAAjHwZ.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZDukHpWEAI8Kj_.jpg"

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1842520435121950887',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1962, ùê∑ùëü. ùëÅùëú, the inaugural film in the James Bond series featuring Sean Connery, premieres in London. 

Directed by Terence Young and based on the novel by Ian Fleming, the plot centers on Bond's mission to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent in Jamaica, leading him to the secretive lair of Dr. Julius No, who is devising a plot to disrupt an American space launch using a radio beam weapon.

ùê∑ùëü. ùëÅùëú was made on a low budget but became a financial success, paving the way for future installments. While it received mixed reviews upon release, it has since earned a reputation as one of the best films in the series. Notably, it introduced significant elements that became trademarks of the Bond franchise, including the distinctive gun barrel opening sequence, the stylized title sequence, and the iconic theme music.

The film also set the stage for the visual style of the series with elaborate sets that enhanced the storytelling. Additionally, ùê∑ùëü. ùëÅùëú incorporated references to earlier and later works in Fleming's series, including the criminal organization SPECTRE, which would play a prominent role in subsequent films.

The film's success led to a flourishing genre of secret agent films in the 1960s, as well as adaptations like comic books and soundtrack albums, further solidifying its cultural impact. Following ùê∑ùëü. ùëÅùëú, the next film in the series, ùêπùëüùëúùëö ùëÖùë¢ùë†ùë†ùëñùëé ùë§ùëñùë°‚Ñé ùêøùëúùë£ùëí, was released in 1963, continuing the legacy of James Bond in cinema.",en,Tweet,1,36,8,11,6540.0,2024-10-05 12:01:18,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZHykffWMAAEZJE.jpg

This October 7th, we, the Utah Congressional Delegation, acknowledge and condemn the evil and depraved act of terrorism inflicted on the Israeli people by Hamas one year ago today. We call for the immediate return of all hostages held by Hamas and stand with those fighting the scourge of antisemitism in our world.

We pray for the return of the seven American citizens still being held hostage by Hamas at this very hour. We call for Hamas to immediately return all remaining hostages to their families with immediate effect.

We note that members of our delegation have met with family members who lost loved ones at the Nova Festival, and the many villages and cities near the Gaza border. We have met with hostage families and stand behind them both in action and in prayer.

We acknowledge that Israel remains one of our most important regional allies and a country with which we as Americans share much in common, and that this premeditated attack was acutely felt in Utah and across the United States.

We remain concerned over the increase of antisemitism in America over the past year, with rhetoric on our college campuses delving into gross tropes, conspiracies, synagogues, and houses of worship threatened with violence, even here in Utah.

We declare that the true intentions of the authoritarian regime in Iran are to destroy the state of Israel and sow chaos in the region through an extensive proxy network.

We continue our efforts to promote strong American leadership that rejects antisemitism at home and abroad, ends accommodation efforts with Iran, and supports the defense and security of the state of Israel.",en,Tweet,0,113,17,10,3040.0,2024-10-07 13:53:10,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZSfApTbMAECJKT.jpg

As I have said before, I vehemently condemn that attack, and Israel has a right and a duty to ensure Hamas is never able to commit such an atrocity again. Israel also has a right to defend against hostilities from Iran, Hezbollah, and other threats. I support the U.S.‚Äôs financial and military commitment to Israel's security. Attacks on Israel from regional actors have significantly increased, threatening civilians across the Middle East and in Israel.¬†We must continue to assist Israel in their defense against these existential threats.
¬†
The U.S. must also remain committed to working with all partners in the region to try to reduce hostilities and ultimately get to a ceasefire. The war in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of people and, despite countless attempts to rescue them, more than 100 hostages remain in captivity ‚Äì including four American citizens. Civilians in the Gaza strip are struggling to survive in catastrophic conditions lacking basic necessities like food, water, medical care, and shelter. It is crucial that Israel do everything they can to safeguard civilians and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Gaza.¬†Ensuring a future of self-governance for the Palestinian people is in the best interest of not only the Palestinians, but also of Israel‚ÄØand the Middle East.‚ÄØIt is the‚ÄØonly path that offers viable long-term security for Israel and peace, prosperity, and dignity for the Palestinian people.‚ÄØIsrael, the United States, and allies and partners in the region‚ÄØmust keep working toward that end.",en,Tweet,0,15,7,17,10381.0,2024-10-07 20:28:00,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZT5uSeaUAAQwY-.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZT5uSdaoAEvlxr.jpg"

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1843626274075341154',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1962, North Korea held parliamentary elections for the 3rd Supreme People's Assembly, where voter turnout was reported at a remarkable 100%, with all votes cast in favor of the candidates.

In North Korea, voting is mandatory, and there is no opportunity for dissent. All citizens aged 17 and older must participate, often facing pressure to show loyalty by arriving early and joining lengthy queues. The voting process involves receiving a ballot with a single name, which voters drop into a publicly visible ballot box. Although there is a private voting booth available, using it could lead to suspicion from authorities.

Once voters leave the polling station, they are expected to join cheering groups outside, publicly expressing enthusiasm for the leadership. State media portray election days as festive occasions, with celebrations surrounding polling stations. In addition to serving as a mechanism for political control, these elections also function as a census, enabling authorities to monitor the population in each constituency and track any potential defectors fleeing to China.

Overall, North Korea's electoral process reflects the regime's strict control over political life, ensuring total compliance and the appearance of unanimous support for the ruling Kim family dynasty.",en,Tweet,0,11,4,6,2840.0,2024-10-08 13:15:31,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZXgU1BWcAAKYym.jpg

Their swift action prevented what could have been a devastating attack.

Tawhedi is an Afghan refugee with ties to ISIS. With the escalating conflict in Israel and across the Middle East, we must remain vigilant against terrorism here at home. Oklahomans know well that many of the Afghan refugees in our communities fought side by side with American troops against the terrorism that attacked our nation on 9/11 and destroyed the nation of Afghanistan.

I have been in direct contact with the FBI about this case for¬†a¬†while and I will remain engaged as Tawhedi is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.¬†As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I will continue to work closely with Federal prosecutors to ensure we are taking every step necessary to keep Americans safe.
