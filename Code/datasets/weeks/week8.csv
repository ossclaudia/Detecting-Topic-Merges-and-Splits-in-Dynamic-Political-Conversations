I have strived to be consistent over the arc of time and respected the fact that elections have consequences.

My role as a United States Senator is different than that of the President. Winning an election allows the President to pick their cabinet, make executive appointments and nominate federal judges for lifetime seats. When you look at my history regarding these matters, you will find that I honor this concept.

Every nominee will have to acquit themselves well during the confirmation process by answering difficult questions and having their actions scrutinized.

We assured them that their loved ones are not forgotten.

It is crucial that Congress remain united in unwavering bipartisan support and solidarity with our ally, #Israel, and continue our efforts urging for the remaining hostages to be freed.

Back in 1923, when insulin was patented, Banting and his fellow researchers made a groundbreaking decision. They declined to put their names on the patent and sold it to the University of Toronto for just $1. Their perspective was clear: it was unethical for a doctor to profit from a life-saving discovery, and they wanted to ensure that everyone who needed insulin could afford it.

Fast forward over a century, and it‚Äôs clear that Banting and his colleagues would be dismayed to witness how their life-saving medication has become synonymous with pharmaceutical price gouging. Stories of individuals with diabetes forced to ration their insulin‚Äîsometimes with fatal consequences‚Äîare all too common. This is a moral outrage.

Now, more than ever, it‚Äôs crucial to safeguard the Inflation Reduction Act, which enables Medicare to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers and caps insulin prices at $35 for Medicare recipients.

The Articles created a weak central government, reflecting the Patriots' fear of centralized power. Congress, a single house with one vote per state, could conduct foreign affairs, raise an army, and declare war, but lacked the power to tax. Amendments required unanimous approval from all states. Maryland's ratification in 1781 marked the Articles' official approval by all 13 states.

By 1787, the system was deemed inadequate, prompting the creation of a new constitution. A secret convention convened in Philadelphia to draft a new framework, leading to the U.S. Constitution in 1789, which replaced the Articles of Confederation. This shift marked a transition from rule by a king, to states' sovereignty, and finally to a unified people forming a federal government.

Today, we shine a spotlight on a man whose extraordinary service to our nation and tireless advocacy for veterans continue to inspire and uplift our community‚Äîmeet this week's Hometown Hero, David A. Christian. 
 
A Levittown native and Woodrow Wilson graduate, David is known throughout the country as the youngest, most decorated Vietnam War officer. David rose to the rank of Captain by 20, serving as an Airborne Ranger and Green Beret, whose bravery was legendary‚Äîleading missions deep into enemy territory, dismantling machine-gun nests armed with only hand grenades and a bayonet, and discovering enemy bases. His heroism earned him nominations for every valor award, including the Medal of Honor and seven Purple Hearts. 
 
David‚Äôs sacrifices were not without cost. Wounded in action seven times and severely burned by napalm, he returned to Bucks County with a new mission: to fight for his fellow veterans. Drawing from his pain and experience, he authored the nation‚Äôs first laws addressing Agent Orange exposure and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), setting a standard for veteran care that remains the ‚Äúlaw of the land.‚Äù

His leadership and expertise earned him appointments under four U.S. Presidents and a role as Senior Advisor to the U.S. Senate on Foreign Relations. David also played a pivotal role in creating the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., raising $9 million to honor his fallen brothers.
 
To this day, David continues to serve our community and veterans, even establishing Victor Six, a non-profit focused on improving our local veterans' mental and physical well-being. The program provides free health and fitness training, fostering resilience, camaraderie, and hope while addressing the critical issue of suicide prevention within the veteran community. For his remarkable service, last May, David was inducted into the National Military Officers Hall of Fame. 
 
As we continue to reflect on Veterans Day, David‚Äôs story reminds us of the extraordinary courage, sacrifice, and service of our nation‚Äôs veterans. Honoring these heroes is not reserved for a single day, it is a responsibility we must uphold every day.
 
Dave, my friend, your sacrifices, leadership, and unyielding devotion to your fellow veterans inspire us all. You are not just a Hometown Hero‚Äîyou are a national treasure. On behalf of our grateful, proud community, we thank you humbly for your lifelong, extraordinary service.",en,Tweet,0,12,1,3,5636.0,2024-11-15 17:04:44,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GccO7koXoAADBF2.jpg

Jones founded the Peoples Temple in the 1950s. Years later, the church faced accusations of financial fraud, abuse, and mistreatment of members. Facing increasing criticism, Jones moved his followers to Guyana , promising a utopian society. However, life in Jonestown was harsh, with members working long hours under strict control, including surveillance, forced confessions, and mock suicide drills. Jones, increasingly paranoid and addicted to drugs, believed the U.S. government was conspiring against him.

Former Temple members and concerned families convinced U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan to investigate Jonestown. The visit began peacefully, but several residents requested to leave. Jones became alarmed and ordered an ambush. Ryan and four others were killed as they attempted to leave the airstrip.

Back in Jonestown, Jones instructed followers to gather for what he called a ""revolutionary act."" Children were poisoned first, followed by adults, while armed guards prevented anyone from fleeing. The next day, authorities discovered hundreds of bodies at the commune, many grouped together. Some members had escaped into the jungle, and others survived because they were in a different part of Guyana at the time.",en,Tweet,2,36,3,10,6991.0,2024-11-18 12:40:05,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcqvIfKWUAEvno_.jpg

Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson Joins Ranking Member @repdavidscott  in Urging Swift Action on #DisasterAid for #Farmers and Families

Washington, D.C. ‚Äì [11/19/2024]  Today, Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson (IL-01) joined Ranking Member David Scott (GA-13) in calling for immediate action from Congress to provide critical disaster aid to farmers and families affected by recent natural disasters. Congressman Jackson issued a statement urging lawmakers to prioritize relief efforts and pass a comprehensive disaster aid package to assist agricultural communities that are struggling to recover from severe weather events, including floods, hurricanes, and droughts.

‚ÄúThe devastation caused by recent natural disasters has left farmers and rural families across the country in urgent need of support,‚Äù said Congressman Jonathan Jackson. ‚ÄúThese hardworking men and women are the backbone of our nation's agricultural industry, and it's our responsibility to ensure they have the resources to rebuild and continue their vital work. I stand with Ranking Member David Scott and my colleagues in calling for swift, comprehensive disaster relief that will provide farmers with the financial assistance and tools they need to recover, rebuild, and ensure food security for future generations.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom #Georgia to #Illinois, from cornfields to cotton fields, communities are reeling from the effects of storms and droughts. This is not just an agricultural issue, it‚Äôs an economic and humanitarian issue. We must pass disaster relief to help these families regain their feet and rebuild stronger than before.‚Äù

Congressman Jackson and Ranking Member Scott have also committed to working with their colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that disaster aid reaches those who need it most and that the relief measures are as effective and timely as possible.

‚ÄúNow is the time for Congress to come together and put people over politics,‚Äù Jackson continued. ‚ÄúWe cannot afford to let these critical relief efforts be delayed. Our farmers' and rural families' lives and livelihoods depend on it.‚Äù

The call for swift action comes as lawmakers prepare for upcoming votes on disaster relief legislation, and Jackson and Scott are committed to pushing for a comprehensive solution that meets the needs of affected communities nationwide.

Wrongly imprisoning academics, activists, and opposition leaders for exercising their right to peaceful political participation and free speech is not the act of a government that values stability or justice.

It is also a betrayal of the promises made when the British handed over governance to China, and a warning of what Chinese authority means for any people wishing to remain free.

The bravery of the Hong Kong 47 ‚Äì and of countless others who refuse to abandon the fight for freedom and democracy ‚Äì demonstrates a truth that the Chinese Communist Party cannot suppress:
