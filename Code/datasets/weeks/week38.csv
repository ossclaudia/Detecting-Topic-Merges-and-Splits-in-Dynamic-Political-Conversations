The same day, a letter appeared in the North Platte Daily Telegraph from an American soldier in the South Pacific. Identified only as a native of Omaha, the soldier had not visited the canteen but “felt he had to make a comment” after finding a feature on it titled “A Little Town with a Big Heart” in Liberty magazine.

Noting his pride in his home state, he wrote, “It makes one feel that the home front is willing to go to the limit to make life as pleasant as possible. There will be a lot of us that won’t come back, but folks like you make it truer than ever, ‘It Is Worth Fighting For.”

He closed by saying, “When the lights come, and the ships sail home in peace, I will stop for a piece of that delicious looking home-made cake.”

These scams are targeting our seniors, veterans, and financially vulnerable neighbors—and we need a whole-of-government response to stop them.

➡️ Detail what’s currently being done to combat fraudulent robocalls
➡️ Identify gaps in authority or resources that Congress can address
➡️ Explain how they’re coordinating with the FCC, FTC, and state leaders

This is part of a broader push I’m leading in Congress to protect consumers and hold bad actors accountable, including:

✅ The QUIET Act – to expose AI-generated robocalls and toughen penalties
✅ The STOP Scammers Act – to hit foreign scam networks where it hurts

Deploying the California National Guard and Marines without consulting the state’s governor is a clear and dangerous abuse of power.

Anyone breaking the law, assaulting police, or perpetrating violence should be held accountable. Attacks on the First Amendment right to peacefully protest are completely unacceptable, yet all protests should be peaceful.

But let’s be clear about what is happening. This move by the President is a distraction from Republicans taking away food from hungry kids and seniors and health care from hundreds of thousands of Nevadans and millions of Americans so they can give the wealthiest Americans massive tax breaks. All while adding $2.8 trillion to the debt.

This action reflects a balanced, responsible approach to deregulation that supports American energy production, protects the environment, and delivers the certainty our producers need after years of burdensome Biden-era rules that pushed investment overseas and jeopardized our path to energy dominance.

As Administrator Zeldin emphasized, even if finalized, no power plant will be allowed to emit more than it does today or did in recent years. The more energy we produce here at home, the better it is for the planet—because no nation produces energy more responsibly or with lower emissions than the United States.

Today, I’m proud to recognize Tyler Feliciano, Front Desk Lead at @nhcwny.

Tyler’s story is one of resilience and leadership. As a first-generation high school and college graduate, Tyler grew up helping his family navigate the complexities of healthcare. That experience drives his work at the Neighborhood Health Center, where he goes above and beyond to help patients every day.

Recently, when a patient preparing for surgery showed up with inactive insurance, Tyler didn’t miss a beat. He got her enrolled so she could still be seen, and then followed up the same day to resolve any issues before her surgery. That’s not just customer service, it’s care in action!

Thank you, Tyler, for leading with heart and showing what it truly means to serve others. Tyler represents what the City of Good Neighbors and the Neighborhood Health Center are all about.

Congress should support our military families and veterans who have made great sacrifices for our country, but this bill falls short. It makes healthcare more costly and less accountable to veterans and the taxpayer by pushing privatization, reduces access to VA medical centers, does not match the housing & childcare needs of our military families, and risks dangerous understaffing as well as the loss of good, experienced VA workers.

Supporting the designation of June as Fidelity Month for the purpose of rededicating the United States to the values of faith, family, and patriotism.

Whereas a recent opinion poll of Americans showed support for traditional values has significantly declined;

Whereas a majority of Americans no longer view values like faith, family, patriotism, or being involved in the community as very important;

Whereas these values used to unite Americans;

Whereas the decline in these values has corresponded with a rise in crime, drug abuse, alienation, and family disintegration;

Whereas fidelity means dedication to faith, spouses and families, and country and communities;

Whereas citizens of all faiths can join in recommitting the United States to fidelity;

Whereas John Adams, a founding father of the United States, said, ‘‘Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.’’;

Whereas survival of the United States depends on the shared bonds of faith, family, and patriotism; and

Whereas it is fitting to observe one month each year to rededicate the United States to its core values: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that June should be designated as Fidelity Month for the purpose of rededicating the United States to the values of faith, family, and patriotism.

The bill takes an axe to public broadcasting which jeopardizes coverage of local news, emergency information like severe weather alerts, and access to PBS KIDS children’s programming, like Sesame Street, for rural communities across America. It forces America to retreat from the world stage by gutting life-saving programs that help prevent pandemics, provide clean water, and gives American agricultural producers the opportunity to help prevent hunger around the world.

Israel's attack on Iran, clearly intended to scuttle the Trump Administration's negotiations with Iran, risks a regional war that will likely be catastrophic for America and is further evidence of how little respect world powers - including our own allies - have for President Trump. Iran would not be this close to possessing a nuclear weapon if Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu had not forced America out of the nuclear agreement with Iran that had brought Europe, Russia, and China together behind the United States to successfully contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions. This is a disaster of Trump and Netanyahu's own making, and now the region risks spiraling toward a new, deadly conflict. A war between Israel and Iran may be good forNetanyahu’s domestic politics, but it will likely  be disastrous for both the security of Israel, the United States, and the rest of the region. As Secretary Rubio stated, the United States was not involved in today's strikes, and we have no obligation to follow Israel into a war we did not ask for and will make us less safe.",en,Tweet,296,4246,1064,1891,593866.0,2025-06-13 03:07:58,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

2. Despite their impressive and ingenious recent military performance, Israel likely lacks the capability to fully dismantle Iran’s hardened nuclear program with a logistically difficult and limited long distance aerial strikes. This isn’t the movies. Nobody should be watching this with popcorn.
3. Iranian strikes against US forces in the region or by their sleeper assets in the US and Europe should be met with a resounding US military response. 🇺🇸
4. The Iranian people in general are decent and want a western compatible way of life. The ruling regime of the Islamic state of Iran have a messianic view of their eventual hegemonic domination of the region, including the destruction of Israel and downfall of the US.
5. Turkey and the Gulf States should think carefully about the inflection point this potentially represents for the region. 
6. Thankfully, the dramatic increase in our domestic oil production has made the Middle East far less important to the US than it was in previous decades, but it doesn’t mean that what’s going on their doesn’t have direct vital strategic interests to the US.
7. It is important that US policy makers and the American people resist the affliction to view international events through our increasingly partisan domestic political lens.

The Trump administration has said it did not participate in the attack and has moved to protect American forces in the region. Iran would be making a serious mistake to retaliate against U.S. forces or interests. 

Iran is a malicious actor and a state sponsor of terrorism that must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon. 

Since the first Trump administration withdrew from the previous nuclear agreement with Iran, it has continued to enrich uranium to higher and higher levels, reducing its breakout time substantially. 

Recently, the Trump administration has attempted to negotiate a new agreement to curtail Iran’s nuclear program that looks a lot like the old agreement.

That possibility is now less probable in the wake of this attack. 

The most immediate risk at the present is that of retaliation, miscalculation, and escalation, which could spiral into a regional conflict or all out war.

After the terrible trauma of the Hamas attacks of October 7th and the war in Gaza that has followed, the last thing the world needs is a wider war. 

My heart goes out to the people of Israel, now facing dangers from every direction. I support Israel’s right to defend itself against any imminent threat, including that emanating from Iran.

It is vital that the Administration now focus on helping Israel defend itself, protect Americans who seek safety, and prevent a broader conflict so that diplomacy can resume.

The extensive air strikes against Iran were targeted; intended to take out senior military leadership and nuclear enrichment and military facilities.  

Iran was given numerous chances to abandon their nuclear enrichment and weaponization activities but chose to push forward despite warnings from President Trump and Israel.  The Iranian Regime has been the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world; they have armed Hamas and Hezbollah and have repeatedly threatened our shared interests with Israel.  They were the orchestrators of October 7th which saw 1,195 Israelis and 46 Americans murdered, and hundreds taken hostage. From the Beirut bombing in 1983 to the 2024 drone attacks against U.S. assets in Jordan, which resulted in the death of three American troops, they have the blood of hundreds of Americans on their hands. Their day of reckoning has come.  

As antisemitism rears its ugly head around the world, the reason for the state of Israel has become abundantly clear.  Israel is the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people, and since its inception they have only wished to live in peace with their neighbors but they will not hesitate to defend their nation, and their people, with every tool in their arsenal – as any nation would.

Congressman Patronis Files Bill to Streamline Environmental Permits
 
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Jimmy Patronis filed H.R. 3902 – Restoring Federalism in Clean Water Permitting Act aimed at cutting red tape surrounding the Section 404 permitting process, which often hampers projects that create jobs and support community priorities. This bill mandates that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator review regulations relating to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act that allow states to assume the environmental approval processes. The goal of this review is to identify ways to reduce administrative burdens and to encourage states to manage their own permit programs. Congressman Patronis is a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure(T&I).
 
Congressman Jimmy Patronis said, “Florida is home to many rich ecosystems that attract millions of people from around the globe to visit our state. Our springs and waterways are some of the most vibrant and pristine in the world, in no small part, due to Florida’s Department of Environmental Protection and water management districts working with local, state, and federal stakeholders to keep them preserved. Many states, like Florida, have the ability to conduct environmental reviews of projects and do so in a timely manner. What we saw under the Biden Administration, however, was the Section 404 process being used to sandbag good projects. Reform is clearly needed as nearly half of states have expressed interest in assuming Section 404 and only three states have EPA-approved programs. With H.R. 3902, Congress will direct the Administrator to conduct a deep dive on the 404 processes, so important projects that aren’t harmful to the environment can get greenlighted without having to deal with bureaucratic or judicial red tape.”
 
T&I Chairman Sam Graves said, “Congressman Patronis’ bill will encourage the EPA to make important reforms to the Section 404 permit assumption process, paving the way for more states to take the lead in issuing these critical permits, which are used in a variety of infrastructure projects—from energy projects to road construction projects to water resource projects. I want to thank Congressman Patronis for his leadership on this issue by taking a critical step in restoring federalism in the Clean Water Act through common-sense reforms that empower states.”

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1933557376201662823',"Each week, we highlight extraordinary individuals across our district working to make a difference in our community. Today, we honor a woman whose resilience and resolve have turned tragedy into a powerful force for change. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: Jill Perez Gobora of Newtown.
 
In 2011, Jill’s sister Amy and Amy’s two young children, Molly and Gregory, were senselessly murdered in a horrific act of domestic violence. Out of that unimaginable grief, Jill made it her life’s mission to protect others from experiencing the same pain—and she has done just that.
 
In 2012, Jill, a preschool teacher at Magic Cottage in Yardley, founded Amy’s Kisses, a Bucks County-based nonprofit that has become one of our region’s most impactful grassroots organizations in the fight to end domestic violence. Its mission is twofold: to educate children early about the signs of healthy relationships and to empower students—especially those facing adversity—through educational opportunities. Since its founding, the organization has raised over $200,000 and delivered life-changing programming and resources to families, schools, and shelters throughout our community and across the country.
 
Through Amy’s Kisses’ signature program, A Bowl Full of Hearts, Jill has helped over 600 young students across 35 classrooms begin to understand what it means to build healthy, respectful relationships. The program is anchored around the children's book Jill wrote in her sister’s memory—now used in schools throughout Bucks County and beyond as a thoughtful, age-appropriate tool for teaching the building blocks of empathy, trust, and kindness. It's a simple but meaningful way to start critical conversations early and carry forward a legacy rooted in both love and prevention.
 
In addition, through the foundation, Jill awards college scholarships to students who have overcome unimaginable challenges, donates Kindle learning libraries and classroom technology to underserved schools, and partners with organizations like A Woman’s Place to ensure that children and families have the resources they need to stay safe, heal, and thrive.
 
As the author of Kayden’s Law and a proud champion of the bipartisan reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, I’ve worked in Congress to strengthen protections for survivors and ensure that the safety of children is never an afterthought. But lasting change requires a united effort. It means partnering with local leaders and advocates like Jill, whose work is making an impact where it matters most: in classrooms, homes, and communities. Together, we are advancing a shared mission—to prevent violence before it starts, to protect the vulnerable, and to build a future where every child grows up safe, supported, and seen.
 
Jill is not just carrying on her sister’s legacy, she’s building her own—one that is changing how we educate, protect, and respond to domestic violence. She is making our community stronger, smarter, and safer.
 
Jill, thank you for your courage, leadership, and commitment to our shared mission. We are proud to stand with you, and honor you as this week’s Hometown Hero.",en,Tweet,0,15,2,14,2233.0,2025-06-13 17:09:36,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtVgLY9WoAYj_f5.jpg

Fentanyl claims more lives than heart disease, cancer, suicide, and homicide.  If the temporary order scheduling fentanyl related substances (FRS) ends, several FRS will become street-legal, law enforcement will lose authority to seize them, and drug traffickers will continue to funnel increasingly deadly drugs into the United States.  

This week, I proudly voted in support of the HALT Fentanyl Act, which permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances (FRS) in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.

"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1933626588333289647',"Yesterday, we voted to pass the first White House rescissions package: a necessary (first step) action to defend American taxpayers from decades of unconstitutional and irresponsible government spending allowed by both parties in Washington. 

While this package does not address every area of government spending, it cuts $9.4 billion in wasteful, woke, and weaponized programs that have long burdened Americans. 

For example, the package claws back $8.3 billion from USAID for line items like $9.3 million to teach Russian doctors to perform abortions, $1 million to Haiti for voter ID, and $833,000 to support “transgender sex workers” in Nepal. It also targets funding for programs that have served as vehicles for leftist agendas at the taxpayer’s expense, including NPR and PBS.

These shameful priorities do not serve the American people. Taxpayer money should never subsidize ideology, whether at home or abroad. We must continue to redirect all government funding to core national interests, not insidious globalist projects. 

When I ran for office, it was on the platform to get us back to Constitutional adherence, including the fiscal realm. The cuts in today’s rescissions package stem from priorities that were never laid out within the eighteen enumerated powers of the Constitution. Such expenditures are an abusive overreach of government power and force a bloated bureaucracy into American lives. This is not the role the Founders intended the government to play and passing these cuts begins to restore that truth.

This vote was a part of a broader effort to address our $36 trillion national debt and the inflation hurting Americans. While every cut counts, there is much more to be done, and I look forward to swiftly passing every rescissions package the White House sends to Congress.",en,Tweet,1,95,19,29,2993.0,2025-06-13 21:44:38,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

In addition to international harm, it has attacked its own citizens, forcing millions to flee to countries around the world. Many have settled here and contribute mightily to the United States. Significant portions of Iranian citizens who remain in Iran yearn for freedom today - and are continually persecuted by the Iranian government. I stand with the Iranian people and Iranian Americans in their pursuit of freedom, dignity, and human rights.

From the Houthis and Hezbollah to Hamas, Tehran has funded a multi-front war against Israel—and Israel has every right to defend itself.

Yet, even more dangerous is the Iranian regime’s nuclear program, an existential threat to Israel and a national security threat to the United States.

Tehran has made it clear for decades, they view the U.S. and Israel as enemies. It’s time to take Tehran’s rhetoric seriously and respond with strength.

We must protect our ally Israel, prevent this state sponsor of terror from targeting our country, and bring this evil regime to its knees.",en,Tweet,17,355,69,97,49572.0,2025-06-15 14:00:01,"<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web Client</a>",,,,

My late father lived a dutiful life, dedicating everything to not only our family, but also our country. He spent twenty years in the Air Force, making exponential sacrifices every single day for this nation, and then worked an additional two decades as a civilian federal employee at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma.

Growing up, and still today, I greatly admired my dad’s service. He was truly a hero. He joined the Army Air Corps on the eve of World War II and by the time he left the military, he was the second most senior master sergeant in the Air Force. My father was known throughout the USAF as the one of the best to run a crew to maintenance airplanes. In fact, he won the “Dock of the Month” prize so many times that McGuire Air Force Base stopped giving the prize out as a whole. Then, when he was placed at Dover Air Force Base, he was assigned the worst dock. Yet, without surprise, he still managed to win the same award seven times at Dover – a testament to his impressive mechanic skills.

Unfortunately, during the last several years of his life, my father battled Alzheimer’s disease. My mother, brother, and I watched him helplessly and with heavy hearts as he became a different person and slowly lost a lifetime of memories throughout the various stages of the disease. He fought the disease with all his strength, but he sadly lost the battle. Yet, the lessons my dad taught me still live on in my heart. I got my strong work ethic from him and am thankful every day that I had a father worth missing so much.

So, as we all celebrate our fathers today, let us remember to thank them for the examples they have set, the love they have shown, and the legacies they have left behind.

I’m increasingly concerned with the growing cases of people in the United States who have fled oppressive regimes and are being detained and held for possible deportation. Cases like Sanabria’s, and so many others with legitimate claims of persecution, require a thorough review.

Sanabria must not be returned to his oppressors. The United States must continue to be a beacon of freedom and democracy–because when we protect those fleeing tyranny, we demonstrate American exceptionalism, uphold our leadership, and strengthen our national security in the face of threats from anti-American criminal narco-dictatorships like the one in Venezuela.",en,Tweet,13,268,126,45,36459.0,2025-06-15 18:33:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtgGjv6WgAAUMpv.jpg

Iran's stated foreign policy has been the destruction of Israel since the Iranian Islamic Republic was formed over 45 years ago.

Iran has backed terrorist groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis all of which also have the overt objective of eliminating the nation of Israel. Given this reality, Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon poses an existential threat to Israel, and Iran's recent significant increase in their uranium enrichment and pursuit of a nuclear capability left Israel with no good options.

The Democrats love to recycle the stale talking point that The One, Big, Beautiful Bill will solely benefit the rich. This is FALSE.

→ This bill preserves and boosts the standard deduction by up to $2,000 for working families, providing relief to 91% of American taxpayers.

→ The One, Big, Beautiful Bill will increase real wages in the U.S. up to $11,600 per worker.

→ The One, Big, Beautiful Bill boosts income for tipped workers by up to $1,700 by eliminating taxes on tips for the 4 million tipped workers.

→ The One, Big, Beautiful Bill boosts income for hourly workers by up to $1,750 by eliminating taxes on overtime pay for the over 80 million hourly workers who work overtime.

Unfortunately the list of fakes are becoming quite long and exposed themselves quickly.

Anyone slobbering for the U.S. to become fully involved in the Israel/Iran war is not America First/MAGA.

Wishing for murder of innocent people is disgusting.

We are sick and tired of foreign wars.  All of them.

And this one will quickly engulf the Middle East, BRICS, and NATO as countries are required to take a side.

Real America First/MAGA wants world peace for all people and doesn’t want our military killed and forever injured physically and mentally. 

We love our U.S. military and love them helping to secure our borders and our cities for the defense of OUR PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY.

They are our friends, spouses, cousins, nieces, nephews, sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters.

We have spent TRILLIONS in the Middle East and we have dealt with the aftermath of death, blown apart bodies, never ending suicides, and disabling PTSD.

All because they told us propaganda as to why we must sacrifice our own to defend some other country’s borders and some other country’s borders.

I don’t want to see Israel bombed or Iran bombed or Gaza bombed.

I don’t want to see Ukraine bombed or Russia bombed.

And we do NOT want to be involved or required to pay for ANY OF IT!!!

We are $36+ TRILLION in debt and have mountains of our own problems.

We have giant planks sticking out of our own eyes while we complain about splinters in other’s eyes.

Every country involved and all over the world can be happy, successful, and rich if we all work together and seek peace and prosperity.

Taking this position is NOT antisemitic.

It’s rational, sane, and loving toward all people.

That’s why I introduced the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act—a bipartisan plan to strengthen our health care workforce and meet rising demand:

✅ Adds 14,000 new Medicare-funded residency slots over 7 years
✅ Prioritizes rural, underserved, and high-need communities
✅ Supports hospitals training above capacity
✅ Invests in rural pipelines and physician diversity

"Gallego, Ruben",Senator,Arizona,,Democratic,"Senate: 2025-Present, House: 2015-2025",Yes,SenRubenGallego,'1934668402116972729',"There’s a lot going on in DC right now. But I want to sound the alarm on an issue that Republicans want you to forget: They’re trying to pass a budget that will strip health care away from millions of Americans to fund tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy. And if you think you’re paying too much to go to the doctor right now, it’s about to get worse. This comes at a time when costs are already too high, especially with Trump’s reckless tariffs.

Congressional Republicans are trying to ram through congress a budget bill that will make drastic cuts to Medicaid in U.S. history. If House Republicans get their way, more than 300,000 Arizonans will lose their health care, including 200,000 people on Medicaid and over 100,000 more who get their plan through the marketplace. On top of that, these cuts would force rural nursing homes and hospitals to close, push more people into overcrowded ERs, and cause over 1,000 avoidable deaths each year.

The Senate is currently negotiating their version of the budget plan, and even some Republican members know that these cuts would be political suicide. But the GOP’s top priority is keeping Donald Trump happy, and so they are charging ahead anyway with throwing working Americans under the bus.

These cuts will hit hardworking families, seniors, children, people with disabilities, and rural communities the hardest.

In the past few months, I’ve held town halls across Arizona to hear from families how much of a lifeline Medicaid is for them.

Here are just some of the stories I heard:

“I am begging you to advocate for Medicaid, especially for people like my son Parker, who is a child with multiple disabilities. Parker would not be alive today if it worked for Medicaid and all of the services that it provides children like him. Our family would not be able to sustain financially if we didn't have access to the services that it provides with therapies and medical interventions.” – Bridget in Phoenix

“I qualify for Medicare due to the rare disease I live with, in the beginning of the disease I was on Medicare before transitioning to Medicare. I live with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD), which requires ongoing treatments and medications to manage debilitating pain and maintain basic functionality. If I lost Medicare benefits, I would face impossible choices daily—skipping critical care, rationing meds, and plunging into financial ruin just to survive.” – Barbie in Phoenix

“My daughter was born in 2005 with a rare genetic condition that has resulted in many complex and life limiting medical conditions, along with significant cognitive and physical disabilities. She requires full care and assistance for every daily activity like dressing, bathing, feeding, etc. [...] I am a widow and an only parent to her. I have to work to provide a roof over our head and to try and give her a life she is deserving of, but I can't do it without the support and services provided by Medicaid.” – Dawn in Chandler

Bridget. Parker. Barbie. Dawn.

That’s who we’re fighting for.

Republicans are fighting for someone else. While their plan takes health coverage away from the people who need it most, it would give households making over $1 million a year an average tax break of $62,000.

This isn’t about reducing the deficit or cutting waste, it’s about rigging the system for the ultra-rich while hardworking everyday families pay the price.

I won’t let that happen.

I’m going to fight like hell to stop this bill and protect the health care that millions of Arizonans count on every single day.",en,Tweet,33,2623,1222,126,28222.0,2025-06-16 18:44:26,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

This achievement was driven by federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration, including $7.4 million from the Low or No Emission Bus Program and $4.4 million from the Urbanized Area Formula Grants. With these federal funds and local matching support, El Metro has added 19 brand new compressed natural gas buses to its fleet, significantly expanding access to clean, reliable transportation for our community.

As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I remain committed to fighting for federal dollars to support infrastructure projects that improve quality of life in South Texas.

With more reliable routes, improved air quality, and expanded service for seniors, students, workers, and families, El Metro is helping connect our residents to jobs, education, healthcare, and opportunity. Public transportation is more than just a ride, it is a lifeline.

I thank Mayor Dr. Victor Treviño, @officialcityoflaredo, @metro_transit, and all our local partners for their leadership in delivering a modern, sustainable, and accessible transit system for the people of Laredo. I am especially grateful to the El Metro drivers, maintenance workers, General Manager Robert Garza, and Assistant General Manager Monica Garcia. Their dedication keeps our city moving every day.

President @realDonaldTrump has officially approved the Colombia Solidarity Bridge expansion - the latest in a series of major bridge projects unlocking cross-border trade for our region.

This brings the total to five international bridge projects in Laredo that now hold presidential permits. That’s the most ever approved for a single region on the U.S.-Mexico border. These projects include:

✅ The World Trade Bridge expansion.
✅ The Colombia Solidarity Bridge expansion.
✅ The Green Corridors Intelligent Freight Transportation System.
✅ The Laredo 4/5 International Bridge.
✅ The Kansas City Southern International Bridge.

The World Trade Bridge is now the most active land port in the United States. The Colombia Solidarity Bridge ranks as the third busiest in the southwest U.S.

Laredo is already the ninth largest port in the world and this expansion will help us meet rising demand, ease congestion, and supercharge trade.

The Colombia expansion includes new southbound and northbound commercial bridge spans, allowing the existing bridge to handle FAST commercial vehicles and oversized traffic. It will also create dedicated lanes for non-commercial vehicles and buses, streamlining traffic flow and modernizing one of the most critical ports on the U.S.-Mexico border.

This is part of a broader effort to position the Port of Laredo to accommodate the growing volume of U.S.-Mexico trade, which surpassed $300 billion in 2023.

I’d like to extend my special thanks to @SenTedCruz and @JohnCornyn for their partnership and to @realDonaldTrump for delivering this latest permit and helping keep Laredo at the heart of the American economy.

Then he came there to a cave and lodged there; and behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and He said to him, ""What are you doing here, Elijah?""

He said, ""I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.""

So He said, ""Go forth and stand on the mountain before the Lord."" And behold, the Lord was passing by! And a great and strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.
After the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of a gentle blowing.

But let’s set the record straight: the claim that Iran was “years away” from a nuclear bomb is flat-out false. Iran was dangerously close to becoming a nuclear power.

They enriched uranium beyond civilian levels, violated international agreements, and ignored repeated IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) warnings. This wasn’t speculation—it was a calculated sprint toward nuclear capability by a regime that chants “Death to America.”

President Trump gave Iran a 60-day diplomatic off-ramp. They chose escalation.

A nuclear Iran is exactly what China, Russia, and North Korea want. It advances their shared anti-American agenda and pushes the world toward conflict.

President Trump has been clear: Iran must NEVER have nuclear weapons. He’s backed that stance with strength, restraint, and strategic clarity.

With this latest permit, Laredo becomes the first region on the U.S.-Mexico border to secure five presidential authorizations for international bridges—an unprecedented achievement that reflects years of planning, advocacy, and collaboration across all levels of government. I want to thank @realDonaldTrump, Senators @tedcruz and @JohnCornyn, and our local partners at @cityoflaredo for their critical support in getting this done.

Laredo is now the #9 largest port globally, fueled by booming U.S.-Mexico trade. We hold more presidential bridge permits than any other border region. The World Trade Bridge is the #1 busiest land port in the U.S., and the Colombia Solidarity Bridge ranks as the #3 busiest land port in the southwest. This new expansion only strengthens our position as a global trade leader.

This is a transformational investment in Laredo’s infrastructure and a clear signal that we’re serious about strengthening our role in international commerce. Last year, we processed more than $300 billion in U.S.-Mexico trade through our port. With this expansion, we’re ready to handle even more.

Laredo has always been where trade drives progress and opportunity reaches across borders.
