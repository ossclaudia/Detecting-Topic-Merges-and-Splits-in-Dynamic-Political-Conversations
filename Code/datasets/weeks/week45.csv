At 10:45pm last night, we finished: confirming Gaisser and Kent, and invoked cloture on Clarkson and two more nominees (at Homeland & US Marshals). 

This morning, we'll advance Cheryl Mason for Inspector General at the VA, then confirm Tyler Clarkson for GC at @USDA. 

Later today: we plan to confirm Gadyaces Serralta to be Director of the US Marshals Service and Matthew Kozma to be Under Sec. at Homeland. 

Leader Thune has filed cloture on more nominees in the pipeline. 

FACT: We've confirmed twice as many Trump nominees today compared to this same point in 2017. BUT every nominee takes about 3.5 hours on procedure without a time agreement with the other side. (Senate rules. Don’t get me started.)

Why does it take so long? In short: Dem obstruction. Not ONE nominee has moved by a voice vote or unanimous consent--that's never happened before. We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. Dems have chosen to do this the hard way. 

What you need to know: We're working w/ the White House every step of the way to confirm the team according to @POTUS’ priorities. Let’s get it DONE.

That truth underscores the urgent need for a fundamental shift in strategy. After nearly two years of war, it’s clear that the complete destruction of Hamas is not a feasible or sustainable goal and the cost of continuing to try is far too high.

Hamas is a terrorist organization and bears full responsibility for the horrific October 7 attacks. But continuing this war indefinitely, with devastating consequences for innocent Palestinian civilians, will not bring peace or security to Israel or the region.

There are Palestinians who reject Hamas’s violence and extremism and they must be empowered to lead. A new path forward is the only way to achieve long-term peace and security. The current course of continued military operations, displacement, and indefinite occupation risks even greater instability, can undermine key regional partnerships, and diminishes Israel’s moral and strategic standing.

It is time for an immediate ceasefire to address the humanitarian crisis and for Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire in exchange for the return of the remaining hostages. Israel must begin working with the United States, Arab partners, and the international community to support credible Palestinian alternatives to Hamas to govern Gaza and the West Bank.

We can continue to support Israel’s right to defend itself while recognizing that the military campaign has reached its limits. The time has come to shift from endless war to a political strategy that brings hostages home, delivers humanitarian relief, and builds the foundations for lasting peace.

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1950919119710105832',"Yesterday I spoke to a Christian pastor from Gaza.

There are children starving. 

And Christians have been killed and injured, as well as many innocent people. 

If you are an American Christian, this should be absolutely unacceptable to you. 

Just as we said that Hamas killing and kidnapping innocent people on Oct 7th is absolutely unacceptable.

Are innocent Israeli lives more valuable than innocent  Palestinian and Christian lives?

And why should America continue funding this?

The secular government of nuclear armed Israel has proven that they are beyond capable of dealing with their enemies and are capable  of and are in the process of systematically cleansing them from the land. 

Most Americans that I know don’t hate Israel and we are not antisemitic at all.

We are beyond fed up with being told that we have to fix the world’s problems, pay for the world’s problems, and fight all the world’s wars while Americans are struggling to survive even though they work everyday.

And many of us, even though we are Christians, no longer want to fund and fight nuclear armed secular Israel’s wars especially when it leads to starving children and killing innocent people including Christians.

Of course we are against radical Islamic terrorism, but we are also against genocide.

You see..

When you have worked your entire life, and will only receive a $1,000 Social Security check, but noncitizens were given $3,500 and more, you are pissed off.

When you have worked your entire life, and all your elected federal officials have recklessly spent and sent your hard earned money to every foreign country and every foreign war and NGO to the point we are almost $40 TRILLION in debt and inflation has caused life to be unaffordable, you are pissed off.

When you have worked your entire life, and your elected federal government officials refuse to fix the absurd problems that makes all insurance unaffordable, you are pissed off.

And for the younger generations, who are trying their hardest to make it in this ridiculous system, they feel hopeless! 

And that makes me burn with anger.

None of this is antisemitic and I, along with millions of Americans, refuse that manipulative label.

It’s the consequences of decades of America LAST policies, nonstop foreign intervention, and the American people clearly seeing the truth and suffering.

Here is where I stand.

No American should face persecution of any kind because of their identity.

Not Jewish American.

Not Muslim American.

Not Christian American.

Not White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, mixed American.

And on and on.

We already have hate crime laws against that and that’s not who we are in America and we have and should continue to work hard to not allow ourselves to become that.

My position is this.

As a U.S. Representative, I represent the American people. 

My full focus is on fixing America’s problems.

And right now, the problems in America are threatening my children’s future.

I consider that a war against my children.

Every single person, no matter who they are that continues to enslave my children in debt, continues policies that make their lives unaffordable, and prioritizes foreign countries and foreign wars above my children’s lives and livelihoods, I see as the enemy waging the war against my children and their generation.

I will continue to push for world peace because that is the type of world I want for my children and all the world’s children.

I want America to put American companies and American jobs first and to protect American land and American homes from foreign consumption. 

Most importantly, I demand the federal government serve the American people, who pay your salaries.

September 30th brings another annual government funding deadline. 

I sincerely hope Republicans, out on August recess right now, will return in September with a renewed focus to stop funding foreign wars and stop waging the fiscal war against my children and their entire generation.",en,Tweet,3949,57469,10007,5721,3795845.0,2025-07-31 14:58:59,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

One of our hidden gems is Oxon Cove Park — a peaceful place where you can walk, connect with nature, and even pet the animals. But it's more than just beautiful land. It’s a place with deep, complicated history.

Watch my video below.

Not far from Washington, D.C., this land was once worked by enslaved people. That’s part of our story — and we can't look away from it.

Right now, some are trying to erase uncomfortable truths from our classrooms and communities. But we must tell the full story of our country — the good, the bad, and everything in between — so we can learn, grow, and make sure we never repeat the mistakes of the past.

Our national parks are more than pretty landscapes. They are living classrooms, places of healing, and a reflection of who we are — and who we want to be.

Let’s preserve them, protect them, and make sure they remain a powerful part of our future.

These objections included raising serious concerns about GHF’s lack of experience, weak internal controls, and safety protocols.
 
I believe in an all-of-the-above approach. If the GHF can massively reform and allay all concerns of corruption, impropriety, bias, and perpetuating violence on the ground, I believe that it can theoretically be part of the assistance efforts in Gaza—but that cannot be at the cost of the well-established NGO and UN channel. Until then, the GHF cannot be allowed to continue to operate with impunity. The people of Gaza are crying out for basic humanitarian assistance, and it is the obligation of the United States to make sure that our assistance is, at minimum, doing more good than harm. The GHF brutality dramatically fails that standard. We must demand better for our assistance and ensure that our aid is not subject to the depraved politics of the Trump administration.",en,Reply,0,7,5,1,1572.0,2025-07-31 19:38:13,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Instead of alleviating suffering, the Trump administration has further exacerbated the crisis by seeking to uproot the admittedly imperfect but nonetheless effective assistance U.N. and NGO delivery system designed under the Biden Administration, and implement its own shady and potentially corrupt organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Fund (GHF). Earlier this month, two whistleblowers came forward, and accused the GHF of heinous and abhorrent conduct. They detailed the use of live ammunition, stun grenades, and pepper spray regularly fired into crowds of desperate and hungry Palestinians at GHF aid distribution sites, resulting in countless injuries and deaths. Some reports indicated that as many as 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid at GHF sites.

"Fine, Randy",Representative,Florida,6,Republican,House: 2025-Present,Yes,RepFine,'1951027504094781800',"Appreciate the 2,500 Rabbis of the Coalition for Jewish Values @cjvalues!   Together, we will fight Muslim terror and the ""Jews"" and ""Jewish groups"" who apologize for it.  

-------

The Coalition for Jewish Values (CJV), representing over 2,500 traditional, Orthodox rabbis in matters of public policy, today expressed its support and solidarity with Rep. Randy Fine (R-FL), after the latter was accused of favoring “starving children,” accusations CVJ called ""dishonest"" and ""outrageous."" 

""Fine simply pointed out that it is the responsibility of the Hamas terror organization to release the Israeli hostages, disarm, and feed its populace. Yet he faced criticism from left-wing media, a congresswoman with a history of antisemitic statements, and, most regrettably, the American Jewish Committee (@AJCGlobal) who declared Fine’s remarks 'unacceptable' and claimed he was focused upon 'scoring political points,'” the organization stated.

According to CJV: ""On the contrary, Mr. Fine demonstrated both moral clarity and courage. He has consistently done so, and recently took to wearing a yarmulke (Jewish skullcap) in Congress to demonstrate solidarity with Jewish students afraid to wear one on their college campus. His statement was an appropriate response to the false and inflammatory claim that Israel is starving Gazans—directly linked to decades of deceitful claims of 'genocide' in Gaza, and centuries of blood libels against Jews—and that Israel is somehow responsible to feed the Hamas terror organization and those who brought it to power. As Senator Tom Cotton also rightly noted, Israel has no obligation to supply aid to its enemies in wartime.""

""It is deeply inappropriate for a Jewish organization to rebuke a Jewish leader when he stands in the breach for the Jewish community. But it is sadly typical of the AJC, which has long positioned itself as a nonpartisan defender of Jewish values and civil rights, yet has a track record of treating Republican lawmakers quite differently than their Democratic counterparts. It has maintained and deepened that pattern under @TedDeutch, the former Democratic congressman who resigned to become AJC’s CEO in 2022. When Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) characterized the genocidal call of 'from the river to the sea' to be an 'aspirational call for freedom,' for which she was censured by the House of Representatives, the AJC was silent. But today it chides Fine for stating the simple truth that Hamas and its supporters are solely responsible for the suffering of Gazans,"" it stated.

CJV called on individuals and organizations ""to reject political posturing and stand with those who defend all lives, including Jewish ones, without apology,"" and that it is proud to support Rep. Randy Fine.""

Thanks to Rep. Jonathan Fritz and William desRosiers of Coterra Energy for helping organize an insightful and productive discussion. We had a productive conversation about how government and industry can work together to scale up mineral extraction, cut red tape, and bring new investment to energy communities across Pennsylvania.

I also highlighted legislation I will soon introduce to establish a production tax credit for extracting critical minerals—including rare earth elements from coal byproducts and lithium from fracking brine. These credits will help unlock overlooked domestic resources, strengthen U.S. manufacturing, and convert industrial waste streams into valuable supply chain inputs.

With the right policy and private-sector partnership, Pennsylvania is ready to power the next chapter of American energy.

"Slotkin, Elissa",Senator,Michigan,,Democratic,"Senate: 2025-Present, House: 2019-2025",Yes,SenatorSlotkin,'1951056532193611924',"Last night I unfortunately missed a vote series on two Joint Resolutions of Disapproval regarding the sale of weapons to Israel.

I have struggled with this Joint Resolution of Disapproval more than any previous votes in the nearly two years since Hamas initiated the attacks of October 7. I represent a state with a large Arab and Muslim population and a large Jewish population. And over these last two years, few issues have been as raw as this one. I have therefore worked very hard to call balls and strikes based on my experience and the facts on the ground, even as most people fall firmly into one side or another, and are often reluctant to consider new information.

I owe it to my state to make clear where I stand: Had I made it back for the vote yesterday, I would have voted yes to block offensive weapons to Israel based on my concerns over lack of food and medicine getting to civilians in Gaza.

I have been a strong supporter of the Jewish State of Israel my whole life. And I still am. But despite the fact that Hamas began this bloody round of conflict—and refuses to release the hostages—the images of emaciated children are hard to turn away from. As are the calls from Michiganders who have friends and family trying to survive in Gaza.

This issue is now widely acknowledged across the political spectrum. Even President Trump this week has expressed concern over the humanitarian situation and urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to ensure the safe delivery of assistance to those in need.

In general, I think these Disapproval votes are a bad way to do foreign policy. The Executive Branch, whether run by Democrats or now Republicans, has the responsibility to set U.S. foreign policy, and to lead negotiations with both allies and adversaries.

But it appears today that the Netanyahu government thinks that there are no limits to what they can do while still receiving U.S. support. And so, I believe a message has to be sent. Should similar votes on offensive weapons come up in the future, I will take them on a case-by-case basis, with the hope of important humanitarian course corrections. I continue to support the U.S.-Israel security relationship and sale of defensive weapons such as the Iron Dome.

My views on this come from my experience of serving three tours in Iraq alongside the U.S. military. It was a very bloody war zone, including terrible violence on U.S. forces and Iraqi civilians, carried out by terrorist groups and militias. But even in the most violent years of the war, the U.S. still had the responsibility to facilitate humanitarian supplies into places like Fallujah. And militaries that can pull off dangerous and complex operations overseas can also ensure aid is safely distributed in occupied areas.

While the leaders of Hamas deserve what they’re getting in response to October 7, and Israel — like any other country in the world — has the right to defend itself, that doesn’t include letting children go hungry. That is despite Hamas’ sick refusal to relent, prevent further destruction, negotiate in good faith and release the hostages.

Lastly, I make this statement today because of my deep concern and conviction for Israel’s long-term security. I believe the Israeli people have the right to live a safe and secure life, free from threat, and chart their own destiny. The Israelis are right to demand the release of all the hostages, living and deceased, immediately and not in stages.

And it has to be said that Israel has dealt with threats to its existence every day since its founding, which is hard for the average American to comprehend. But the actions being taken now by the Netanyahu government threaten the longstanding bipartisan consensus that have helped keep Israel safe since its inception.

No one leader should so significantly threaten the long-term security of the state of Israel. I urge the Trump Administration and the Israeli Prime Minister to get aid in as soon as possible and save lives.",en,Tweet,265,1921,287,2162,1185905.0,2025-08-01 00:05:00,"<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web Client</a>",,,,

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1951324241413947545',"🚨 Lyme disease is surging across Bucks and Montgomery Counties—and Pennsylvania now accounts for nearly 30% of all cases nationwide.

This isn’t a surprise. It’s the result of years of warnings that went unheeded. That’s why I’ve been working with local health officials, scientists, and national advocates to lead a strong, sustained federal response.

Here’s what we’re doing:

I’m leading a bipartisan push to modernize how our country prevents, detects, treats, and responds to tick-borne illnesses, including:

✅ Kay Hagan TICK Act Reauthorization – To reestablish a coordinated national strategy
✅ LymeX Authorization Act – To accelerate innovation in diagnostics and treatments
✅ Children Inflicted by Lyme Disabilities Act – To expand protections for kids with chronic Lyme
✅ BITE Act – Creates an AI-powered tick outbreak alert system
✅ Tick Identification Pilot Program – Supports state-level photo-based tracking programs

I’ve also fought to expand Lyme research funding through both the Defense and Health Appropriations bills, to ensure science gets the investment it needs.

But until there’s a cure, prevention is key. As we head into Lyme Disease Awareness Month, here’s how to protect yourself and your family:

• Use EPA-registered repellents (DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus)
• Wear light-colored clothing and tuck in your pants/shirt
• Shower within 2 hours of outdoor activity
• Do a full-body tick check—especially behind knees, underarms, hairline, waistband 
• Check pets and gear—ask your vet about year-round tick preventatives

⚠️ Watch for symptoms:
• Bullseye rash (may not always appear)
• Fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain
• In kids: memory issues, joint aches, behavioral changes

🕒 Early detection is key. The sooner it’s caught, the easier it is to treat.

Today, we honor a true American leader—meet this week’s Hometown Hero, Colonel Eric Swenson of Churchville.
 
A graduate of Council Rock and the United States Military Academy at West Point, Colonel Swenson has spent over 25 years in uniform, serving our nation with honor. He is not only a decorated Army officer and combat veteran—he’s a scholar, strategist, and public servant whose leadership has left an indelible mark both at home and abroad.
 
With a PhD in Industrial Engineering from Penn State, and advanced degrees from the Naval and Army War Colleges, Col. Swenson has led everywhere from the battlefield to the classroom—commanding engineer battalions, shaping military strategy, and mentoring the next generation of Army leaders. As Commander of the Army Corps’ St. Paul District, Col. Swenson led critical infrastructure and recovery efforts across five states.
 
In January, when devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles County—killing 12 and destroying more than 6,800 structures—Col. Swenson was called in to lead the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ emergency response. The scale of destruction was staggering. The grief was raw. Yet under his steady command, the mission became what officials called “the fastest, safest, and most community-integrated cleanup operation in California history.”
 
As U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll put it: “Your team cleared debris, repaired infrastructure, and restored essential services—but what really sets you apart is the trust you built with the community.”
 
Col. Swenson walked side by side with survivors, listened to their stories, stood in the ashes of what they lost, and helped chart a path forward—one phone call, one handshake, one act of compassion at a time.
 
Now preparing to assume command of the U.S. Army Corps’ North Atlantic Division—overseeing critical operations across the Northeast and Europe—Colonel Swenson continues to serve with humility, brilliance, and a deep sense of duty to the American people.
 
Colonel Swenson, Bucks County is proud—and deeply grateful—for your service and the sacrifice your family has shared along the way. Join me in thanking and celebrating this true hometown hero!",en,Tweet,0,4,2,5,1150.0,2025-08-01 19:59:01,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GxSc3M6W4AAljqP.jpg

The rest of the United States locality pay rate currently applies to FCI Ray Brook. However, New York suffers proportionally worse than the rest of the country due to the affordability crisis under failed Governor Kathy Hochul.

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1951712134225674322',"In 2024, America voted to end funding and fighting foreign wars. 

Funding, fueling, and ultimately fighting Russia in Ukraine would be a complete betrayal to the majority of Americans who want nothing to do with paying to murder people in some foreign land over a foreign conflict that has absolutely zero affect on our lives.

The same scenario goes for continuing to fund and fight  offensive wars on behalf of the secular government of nuclear armed Israel.

Republicans will lose the younger generation of voters and may never get them back.

Not that they will necessarily flip Democrat because Democrats 100% support the war in Ukraine because it was really started under Obama/Biden. It’s a Democrat driven war that also amassed the usual neocon Republican support. 

And funding and fighting offensive wars on behalf of the secular government of nuclear armed Israel is supported overwhelmingly by both parties.

These younger generation of voters (ages 40-50 and younger) are beginning to feel completely unrepresented by both parties because of the absurd America LAST policies, votes, and tax payer funding that has made life unaffordable and the future bleak for the vast majority of average Americans.

I’m in agreement with them in certain areas.

What is sickening is that Gaza started a genocidal war whose goal was to kill as many men, women, and children as possible.  The death toll only stopped at 1200 because of the response.   More than 40 of those were American.  

Gaza took 250 hostages as part of their genocial attack who Gazans have tortured and starved.  Many of those were American too. 

Gazans allowed their homes, mosques, schools, and hospitals to be militarized using billions of dollars to create tunnels.   

And now Gazans are losing the war. 

Wars are horrible.  If Gazans didn't want the consequences of them, they should not start them.  

And if Gazans don't want more of this, they can release the hostages and surrender.

On the anniversaries of the July 2023 and 2024 Vermont floods, I introduced the Disaster AID Act.  It cuts red tape at FEMA so assistance can be distributed more quickly and efficiently to towns hit by flooding, wildfires, tornadoes, or other weather catastrophes. 

I reintroduced the Rural Recovery Act, which provides local USDA Rural Development offices with funding to help rural communities recover after a natural disaster. 

Big Pharma is abusing the patent system to keep prices high, making patients pay more for the prescriptions they need.  I led a bipartisan, bicameral bill to make it easier for more affordable generic and biosimilar drugs to enter the market.  

For our servicemembers, I’m working to prohibit the use of open-air burn pits that have caused life-long health issues for some of our veterans and improve how the burn bit registry can be updated. 
 
The 340B program is a lifeline that helps rural hospitals and health centers access affordable prescription drugs and expand their services.  I introduced legislation to thwart Big Pharma’s push to cut back on the program.  
 
President Trump has been waging an unnecessary and volatile trade war against Canada, the largest trading partner to Vermont and 33 other states.  I introduced a bill to exempt small business owners from the painful tariffs being placed on our northern neighbor.  

Right now, AI companies can build their models without sharing how they're doing it. I reintroduced legislation that gives musicians, writers, and other artists a legal pathway to learn if the work they own is being used by AI companies without proper consent or compensation.  

The so-called ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ was really one giant handout to Big Pharma and sells out folks using Medicaid.  I led an effort to repeal new out-of-pocket expenses placed on care for our seniors, children, and people with disabilities, and close the loophole that lets drug companies charge more.  

The smaller the farm, the more challenging it is for a dairy farmer to earn and stay recognized as an organic producer.  I reintroduced the O DAIRY Act to provide a safety net for small organic producers facing heavy losses and collect data to help them prepare for the future. 

While President Trump and Republicans are taking from the American people to give tax cuts to billionaires, I’ll continue working to improve the lives of working families in Vermont and across the country.",en,Tweet,0,14,3,4,801.0,2025-08-04 17:06:59,"<a href=""https://sproutsocial.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Sprout Social</a>",,,,
