They are inherently divisive by their very nature. American citizens largely agree on 80%+ of issues.  They just want our government to function the same pragmatic way as do our businesses, our families and our personal relationships.  It is the political party structure itself, dividing “Red versus Blue” and “Democrat versus Republican,” that creates barriers between us and halts so much needed progress. It’s why I’m so proud to Co-Chair the Bipartisan @ProbSolveCaucus with my friend & colleague, @RepTomSuozzi.  Together, we seek to advance a very different model and a refreshing new change, a coalition of pragmatic and reasonable centrists from all walks of life, and with a variety of perspectives, to respectfully collaborate together, to see the world through the other person’s eyes, and to find common ground. It is the duty of every leader to be a bridge, not a wedge. This must be reflected in both our words and our actions. This is far and away the most critical ingredient to preserve our democracy.

"Whitesides, George",Representative,California,27,Democratic,House: 2025-Present,Yes,Rep_Whitesides,'1900209675376980145',"My team attended last night’s meeting about the Chiquita Canyon Landfill. The situation is unacceptable. The landfill operator has terminated relief payments, and claim that their problems have improved, but refuse to provide transparent data. Now, state officials say the subsurface reaction has gotten worse.

Today, I'm sending a letter to the EPA to demand they investigate the truth about the current size, scope, and emissions of the landfill reaction, and release a public report. Our residents deserve better.

I am also incredibly concerned that the Administration is slashing the EPA workforce. The proposed 65% cut of EPA staff will radically undermine the agency's ability to protect the public health of all Americans through research, regulation, education, and enforcement.

Washington, D.C. (March 13, 2025) — Today, Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson (IL-01) released the following statement in response to a federal judge’s ruling ordering the immediate reinstatement of federal employees unjustly terminated by Elon Musk and DOGE, including workers in the Department of Defense, the Department of Treasury, and the Department of Veterans Affairs:

“This ruling is a victory for working families, the rule of law, and the fundamental rights of our nation’s public servants. Across Illinois’ First Congressional District, thousands of federal employees, including VA nurses, postal workers, and transit safety inspectors, serve our communities with dedication. The unlawful terminations orchestrated by Elon Musk and rubber-stamped by the Trump-Musk Administration were a direct attack on these workers and their families.

“The court’s decision is clear: these public servants must be reinstated immediately. That includes the many essential employees in Illinois who help provide critical services—from maintaining our national parks to ensuring that our veterans receive the care they deserve. These are real people with real families, and their livelihoods should never have been jeopardized for political gain.

“I stand with my colleagues on the Oversight Committee in holding the Trump-Musk Administration accountable for their blatant disregard of labor laws. We will not allow their reckless and unlawful actions to undermine the stability of our federal workforce. In Illinois alone, over 8,000 federal employees contribute daily to essential services, and I will continue fighting to protect their jobs, their rights, and their dignity.”",en,Tweet,0,5,3,0,355.0,2025-03-13 18:25:06,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

September 16, 2024: “If the government shuts down, it will be average Americans who suffer most. A government shutdown means seniors who rely on Social Security could be thrown into chaos as the Social Security Administration limits certain services, like benefit verifications or fixing errors in payments. Our veterans could see regional VA offices shut down and support services put on halt. Some of our military service members could be forced to work without pay. Families who benefit from WIC and other nutrition programs could see benefits halted. And a shutdown would shake the confidence of our economic recovery, something we can’t possibly afford at a time like this.”",en,Tweet,7,291,91,62,5040.0,2025-03-13 20:03:24,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

This should never have happened. Everyone responsible for organizing and participating in this occupation must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Think of it like this: If senators keep talking about an issue to delay or block a decision (this is called a filibuster), cloture is the way to stop them. It takes 60 votes to pass cloture and move forward. Once cloture is approved, debate is limited, and the Senate must take a final vote.

In short, cloture prevents endless talking and makes sure decisions get made.

This week, we shine a light on an incredible man shaping the minds of the next generation, fostering curiosity, and inspiring a lifelong love of discovery—meet this week's Hometown Hero, Dave Curry.
 
For 33 years, Dave Curry has done more than teach Earth and space science—he has transformed how students experience it. As an educator at Newtown Middle School in the Council Rock School District, he has made geoscience not just a subject, but an adventure—one that empowers young minds to see the world differently, think critically, and explore with purpose. His extraordinary commitment to innovation and excellence in science education has earned him the prestigious 2025 American Geosciences Institute’s National Edward C. Roy Jr. Award for Excellence in K-8 Earth Science Teaching, a national recognition that reflects his profound impact on the field.
 
Dave's innovative approach to education is best exemplified by the multi-month, computer-based lab exercise he developed, which builds on NASA’s Sally Ride EarthKAM program. Through this immersive, hands-on experience, his students don't just learn about the Earth—they become scientists, working with real satellite imagery and data to study weather systems, geologic processes, coastal erosion, and plate tectonics. They analyze how natural forces shape the planet, engage in the same methodologies used by geoscientists, and discover firsthand how science can solve real-world problems.
 
This is the power of a truly exceptional educator—one who doesn’t just teach facts but opens doors to possibility and excitement. Dave's students see themselves in the work of scientists, engineers, and innovators. They aren’t just absorbing knowledge; they’re developing the skills, confidence, and curiosity that will lead them to shape the future.
 
Beyond the classroom, Curry’s passion for science education knows no bounds. His leadership as a mentor for the American Meteorological Society’s DataStreme graduate courses, his role as a science fair sponsor, and his deep engagement in professional organizations reflect his unwavering dedication to ensuring students have access to the very best in Earth and space science education.
 
Our teachers are heroes; they are the architects of the future and the catalysts of discovery. At a time when our nation faces a growing teacher shortage, the need for passionate, innovative, and skilled educators has never been more critical. The success of our next generation hinges on the excellence, dedication, and mentorship of educators like Dave Curry—those who go beyond the curriculum to ignite imaginations, fuel ambition, and shape the scientists, problem-solvers, and visionaries of tomorrow.
 
Please join me in congratulating Dave on the well-deserved recognition of his work, and thanking him, along with all our dedicated PA-1 teachers, for their selfless efforts in guiding our next generation of leaders. Dave, we applaud you and thank you—you are shaping the future, one inspired student at a time.",en,Tweet,1,7,0,4,1158.0,2025-03-14 15:56:12,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GmA0b_QWwAArkG9.jpg

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration delivered this week:
With Tesla stock plummeting, President Trump and Elon Musk hosted a car show on the grounds of the White House immediately after Musk hinted he'll drop another $100M into Trump's political operation.
Speaker of the House Johnson calls for an investigation into ""attacks"" on Tesla owners and vehicles while framing Elon Musk's work eviscerating the federal workforce as ""heroic.""

The Justice Department is shrinking its public corruption unit just weeks after a top official there ordered the corruption charges against the New York Mayor to be dropped, and the unit's leader resigned in protest. This unit was created in 1976 in the wake of the Watergate scandal exposing Nixon's presidential corruption.

EPA director Lee Zeldin eliminated all EPA environmental justice offices, which exist to reduce pollution in poor rural and urban communities.

The Family Trump is in talks with Binance to buy a stake in the crypto exchange that pleaded guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money-laundering requirements.

FBI director Kash Patel is criminalizing Habitat for Humanity and similar groups that have received some level of funding from the EPA, alleging the groups are conspiring to defraud the US.

And for some reason, Donald Trump Jr. (but not his father nor the US Secretary of State) met in Belgrade with the Serbian president whose government signed a deal last year with Jared Kushner's company to build a hotel there.

But instead of working toward a bipartisan solution, Republicans rammed through this extreme measure, ignoring the needs of the people they were elected to serve. By passing this CR, Republicans weakened Congress’ power of the purse and handed greater control over taxpayer dollars to Trump and his wealthy backers – with no oversight or guardrails.

No one wants a government shutdown, but we are headed into disastrous times. Republicans are determined to cede their power and oversight to Donald Trump, abandoning their duty to the American people and allowing these dangerous actions to go unchecked. I will continue fighting alongside House Democrats to push back against this egregious overreach of power.

Caesar was murdered in the Senate House by about 60 conspirators, including Brutus and Cassius.

She welcomed me to Congress with open arms, and we had the opportunity to work closely as members of the New York Congressional Delegation, where I witnessed firsthand her tireless efforts to champion change and uplift women, minorities, and families.

As the first female chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Congresswoman Lowey was a trailblazer whose leadership left an indelible mark both domestically and internationally. She was a fierce advocate for women’s rights, securing critical funding for women’s health. Her leadership in foreign affairs strengthened America’s standing in the world, and her bipartisan work post-9/11 helped bolster national security and support for New York during one of its most challenging times.

I extend my heartfelt condolences to her family, her husband Stephen, and their children and grandchildren during this time of bereavement. We will remember fondly the legacy of inspiration and progress she leaves behind for each of us to follow.

Trump apologists claim that he's executing a 'reverse Nixon' in his appeasement of Russia, by wedging China's junior partner from it. That's wrong. First, because accepting the premise of Russian revanchism in Ukraine emboldens Chinese revanchism in Taiwan and the South China Sea. Second, because undercutting NATO in attempting this wedge is more likely to drive Europe towards China, out of economic and security concerns, than Russia towards the United States. And third, because Russia & China have given zero indication that their 'no-limits' partnership is unraveling — indeed they are increasing cooperation.

"Clarke, Yvette D.",Representative,New York,9,Democratic,House: 2007-Present,Yes,RepYvetteClarke,'1901697628833710145',"Let me be very clear: NO ONE believes gang members should walk free in America – but these men have been convicted of NOTHING. No court has found them guilty, and any one of the nearly 300 people targeted could be innocent of what they are accused. There is not a shred of evidence to suggest otherwise. Yet, on the word of Donald Trump alone and against the direct orders of a federal judge, this administration deported them to a foreign prison thousands of miles away. Then they sadistically applauded their humanitarian abuses in a highly produced video for their followers on social media.

And so, the question every American needs to ask today is the same question Americans asked during the internment of our Japanese-American neighbors during World War II, it is the same question Americans asked when lives and livelihoods were destroyed during the Red Scare, it is the same question that should be asked in response to every claim out of the president’s lying mouth: WHERE. IS. YOUR. PROOF? When this administration answers with silence, that will just confirm what we already know – according to Donald Trump, due process is now a relic of America’s past. Innocence is irrelevant, and so is the rule of law. Everything our Constitution stands for is second to what Donald Trump wants, and how hateful and cruel he feels on any given day.

If you think what this video represents will never reach your home, think again. Because when the Trump Administration continues their lawless crusade, very soon, they’ll have to turn to other groups to fill this president’s quota for human suffering. When that happens, you just might see your friend or neighbor in another video from this White House – it will call them a criminal, mock their misery, and celebrate their pain as a victory for Americans. You'll know the truth, but it won't matter. From now on, the White House decides what the truth is.

Our Irish ancestors came to America seeking opportunity, and in doing so, they helped shape, defend, and enrich this nation in ways too vast to measure. Their story is one of hardship and hope, struggle and triumph—woven into the very fabric of our country. 

Today, with nearly 2 million Irish Americans in Pennsylvania and millions more across the nation, that legacy endures. As the proud descendant of Irish immigrants and a steadfast Friend of Ireland, I am honored to introduce legislation to recognize St. Patrick’s Day as a federal holiday—a well-deserved tribute to the incredible impact of the Irish on the American story.

So raise a glass, wear your green, and celebrate the luck, legacy, and lasting influence of the Irish!

Most recently, Arlington National Cemetery quietly removed pages detailing the histories of Black, Latino, and women servicemembers laid to rest there – whitewashing historical records of their sacrifice.

By order of Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth, these pages were “unpublished” to align with the administration’s shameful efforts to censor discussions of race and gender in the military. This is a direct insult to those who, despite discrimination and adversity, served our nation with honor and distinction.

Erasing their stories erases their courage and sacrifice. I am calling on the Trump Administration to immediately restore these pages and stop its disgraceful distortion of American history.

I strongly oppose Trump’s decision to pardon criminals who assaulted police officers attacked our Capitol, and tried to overturn a free and fair election. And now, his DOJ is trying to rewrite the law to let even more offenders off the hook. That’s not justice, it’s corruption.
 
Our system of checks and balances exists for moments like this. Judges must continue to uphold the law, and Congress must hold those in power accountable.

Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian political system that prioritizes absolute power, nationalism, and control over individual freedoms. It often suppresses opposition, controls the media, and uses fear and division to maintain power.

Throughout history, fascist leaders have risen by attacking democracy, silencing dissent, and stripping away rights—all under the guise of “protecting the nation.” It is a dangerous ideology that threatens freedom, justice, and equality.
