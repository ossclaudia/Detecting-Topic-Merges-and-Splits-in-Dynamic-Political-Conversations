"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1902518928418496894',"The Sunoco/Energy Transfer pipeline leak in Upper Makefield has raised serious concerns about public health, environmental safety, and regulatory oversight. While PADEP has responded to some inquiries, critical questions remain unanswered—questions that demand immediate and thorough responses.

As I continue working alongside the dedicated residents of the Upper Makefield Task Force and in addition to my calls for PHMSA to temporarily shut down the pipeline, I am once again calling on PADEP Acting Secretary Jessica Shirley to provide greater accountability, independent oversight, and a firm commitment to full environmental remediation.

Among the most pressing questions PADEP must answer:

✔️ Why is PADEP downplaying public concerns about MTBE, Lead, and VOCs? Any level of contamination—especially near a nearly 70-year-old petroleum pipeline—should be treated as a serious risk.

✔️ Why is Energy Transfer’s own contractor conducting the testing? Independent, third-party verification is essential to ensuring public trust and accurate results.

✔️ Why hasn’t PADEP required full environmental restoration? A pipeline leak of this magnitude demands more than minimal compliance—it requires a complete and thorough cleanup.

PADEP must act decisively to protect residents and hold Energy Transfer fully accountable. Our community deserves transparency and real solutions, not delays or half-measures. I will keep pushing until we get the accountability this situation demands.

President Trump has made this a priority just like he said he would.

President Sheinbaum and her head of security Omar Harfuch are breaking records in drug busts and arrests, targeting Sinaloa’s fentanyl production mostly. They are also open to American help for the first time in…maybe ever. 

This is a terrorist-insurgency problem that is destroying Mexico and killing Americans. Defeating the cartels will require a Counter-Insurgency strategy that involves every agency in both the U.S. and Mexico. 

Our biggest problem? Congress still isn’t focused. I’ve worked for over a year as head of our Cartel Task Force (with no additional staff and no funding) to develop a whole-of-government strategy to defeat the cartels and produce the legislation that President Trump will need. But there is more work to do. It’s why I asked @SpeakerJohnson to create a Select Committee on Cartels so we could hire proper staff and get the legislation right. He told me that he agreed.

"Doggett, Lloyd",Representative,Texas,37,Democratic,House: 1995-Present,Yes,RepLloydDoggett,'1902835901853806706',"Today, Trump signed an Executive Order directing Secretary McMahon to take all necessary steps to dismantle the Department of Education, an agency that serves over 5.6 million students across 9,000 Texas K-12 schools. This reckless, unlawful action doesn’t just skirt Congressional authority—it endangers the support for the most vulnerable students and schools in Texas: the 700,000 students with disabilities, the $140 million allocated for bilingual learners, and the $1.8 billion in funding for Title I schools that serve over 3.6 million students, including many in Austin.

As a product of Austin public schools myself and as a father and grandfather of successful AISD students, I know the value dedicated educators bring to our community. Our public schools are vital for both individual opportunity and our continued economic promise.

It’s so appropriate that Governor Abbott has joined President Trump for this announcement, since both are undermining public education. Their attacks on federal support for education are furthered by their promotion of state and federal voucher schemes. This isn’t just about policy—it’s about priorities. Abbott’s and Trump’s actions cater to the demands of billionaire donors to redirect these funds to finance private academies and trillions in tax breaks.

President Trump may claim to put America first, but this latest move makes it painfully clear: he is putting us last. In Texas alone, the Department provides over $580 million to support our workforce. Yet Trump, out of touch with the lived experience of working families, seeks to cripple investment in both our students and our future workforce. His agenda, supported by Elon Musk and Governor Abbott, is simple: starve our public schools—the foundation of our democracy—of resources that create well-informed citizens. Why? So it’s easier to sell their backward beliefs, peddle their “alternative facts,” and secure a future where ignorance is a weapon.

Because the Department of Education was established by statute enacted by Congress, Trump has no authority to shut it down by Executive Order. This is another attempt to overwhelm and wear down the American people.

All across the Granite State there are vibrant public schools that provide critical public education to students from all walks of life. They do so with the essential help of the federal Department of Education, which provides funding and technical expertise to schools so that they can support children who need extra support in the classroom — children whose families are struggling financially, children who are facing mental health challenges, and children with disabilities. The challenges that these children and their families face won’t go away because President Trump and Elon Musk turn their backs on them. Instead, the decision to shutter the Department of Education will leave some children in our country without the education that they deserve and shift costs to local communities, raising property taxes. 
 
Our education system is challenged, to be sure, but rather than focus on how to help our local school districts provide the best possible education for all of our children, the Administration has run away from the opportunity and obligation to ensure that all American children can receive a quality education to prepare them for adulthood.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1903113298565890297',"Each week, we share stories of remarkable individuals from across our district who are making a difference. This week, we shine a light on an incredible woman who is the embodiment of strength, compassion, and quiet heroism. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: Diane Reitz of Levittown.
 
For over six decades, Diane Reitz has been a constant presence in our community—a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and a servant leader in every sense. A nurse by profession and caregiver at heart, she’s led Girl Scout troops, championed wellness, and raised over $50,000 for women’s heart health. Through quiet acts of service, both seen and unseen, Diane has left a lasting mark on countless lives.
 
What makes Diane’s story extraordinary is not only the breadth of her service—but also the courage with which she continues it. Even now, in the face of unimaginable adversity, as she battles stage IV pancreatic cancer, she continues to serve with grace, humility, and purpose.
 
Of all her contributions, her work with our nation’s veterans speaks most powerfully to the depth of her character. In a world where invisible wounds often go unseen, Diane chose to see them—and to act. Together with Vietnam War hero Captain David A. Christian, she co-founded Victor Six Health and Fitness Organization, a groundbreaking program built on a simple but profound belief: restoring the body can help restore the mind.
 
What began as an idea rooted in compassion has become a lifeline for hundreds of veterans struggling with the weight of trauma. Through this program, veterans not only regain their physical strength but reconnect with hope, purpose, and life itself. The result is nothing short of extraordinary: since its founding, not one participant has taken their own life.
 
Diane’s impact transcends statistics. It lives in the veterans who now stand with renewed strength, in the families who have found healing and wholeness, and in the countless individuals who feel seen, heard, and uplifted because she chose to walk beside them. She has become a quiet force of hope in our community—a steadfast reminder of what it truly means to live a life of purpose, compassion, and unwavering service to others.
 
Thank you, Diane, for the example you’ve set and the lives you’ve touched and saved. Our community is better, kinder, and stronger because of you. You are, in every sense, a true Hometown Hero.",en,Tweet,0,5,1,3,945.0,2025-03-21 15:55:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gmk3TbJWoAA299R.jpg

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1903144701600936235',"I have co-sponsored every Article of Impeachment introduced in the House against unelected judges who believe they have the power to usurp Article II and override the authority of the duly elected President of the United States, chosen by a majority of the American people.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg recently ordered that deportation flights carrying Venezuelan gang members—criminals responsible for the deaths of American citizens—be turned around mid-flight.

This ruling is not just an affront to the millions of Americans who support President Trump’s mission to secure our country, it is entirely nonjusticiable.

President Trump is our Commander-in-Chief and was exercising the powers fully vested in him by Article II of the Constitution. No judge at any level, including the Supreme Court, can limit the constitutional powers granted to the President.

Issuing such a weaponized, politically motivated judgment in bad faith undermines the credibility of our entire judicial system and demands immediate action from Article I to defend and uphold Article II.

Impeachment and removal from office is the constitutionally prescribed remedy, and it is urgently needed.

Unfortunately, Judge Boasberg is not alone. Other judges have similarly issued political rulings designed to undercut President Trump and his administration.

No single District Court judge in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, or anywhere else has more authority than the Presidency.

That’s why I’ve co-sponsored Articles of Impeachment against five federal judges so far. 

I’m also in support of legislative options to reign in rogue judges trying to play President. 

However, the easiest way to stop these rogue judges is for Congress to do our job and pass our own budget and policies through one big beautiful bill just like President Trump has asked us to. 

We are LAWMAKERS and we are the legislative body that can fund, defund, and make laws and then judges have to rule with the law.

Mae is a living legend whose strength, spirit, and service have not only shaped the course of history but inspired generations of Americans to believe in the power of patriotism and purpose.

Mae, of Levittown, is one of the original Rosie the Riveters who helped lead our nation to victory in WWII, but her service didn’t end there. For decades, she’s championed recognition for her fellow Rosies, and I’ve been proud to work alongside her in this fight. Leading the Rosie the Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act was one of the greatest honors of my career, and presenting Mae with the medal on the shores of Normandy, on the 80th anniversary of D-Day, was a moment I’ll never forget.

And now, on this milestone birthday, I am proud to introduce the Rosie the Riveter Day Act — legislation that will formally recognize March 21st each year as a day to honor the courage, sacrifice, and legacy of Mae and her fellow Rosies. 

Happy Birthday, Mae, my dear friend! You are a hero, a fighter, and an icon. Your life is a living reminder that patriotism is not just a word — it’s a lifetime of service, persistence, and heart.

George Foreman wasn’t just a champion in the ring—he was a champion for our community.

Raised in Houston’s 5th Ward, he knew struggle. He turned that struggle into strength—winning Olympic gold in 1968, becoming a two-time heavyweight champion of the world, and redefining what redemption looks like. 

After walking away from boxing, George found faith. He became an ordained minister, started the George Foreman Youth and Community Center right here in Houston, and spent decades mentoring at-risk kids. 

He named all five of his sons George Edward Foreman. Why? To create unity. To build a bond that said, “If one goes up, we all go up.”

George gave his time, his resources, and his heart—quietly and consistently. From Kingwood to Huffman, folks knew “Big George” as the man who showed up, supported local schools, bought class projects just to give them back, and donated signed gloves to every charity that asked.

He never stopped serving. He never stopped believing. And he never forgot where he came from.

To me, it’s both an ideal and a tool, one that survives through our actions and advocacy. It reminds us that our unique identity within the United States must be continually protected and uplifted.

As we mark 49 years since the signing, it’s up to us to give life to this agreement, to defend our rights, and to stay true to the principles of self-government and self-determination—even when it’s hard.

Here’s to honoring the past, meeting the moment, and continuing to define our future.

What exactly does that look like? It means real resources. Professional staff. And a focused mission to confront this threat head-on.

For the last two years, I’ve been leading a task force without staff, without funding — over 30 meetings with experts and officials, multiple trips to Mexico, Colombia, and Panama. We’ve laid the groundwork. Now it’s time to scale it.

This issue cuts across ten different committees. That means no one owns it — and that’s a recipe for inaction. A Select Committee would fix that. It would focus Congress, align with the administration, and help deliver effective solutions.

The cartels are our greatest narco-terror threat. The mission is clear. The moment is now. We should vote on this Select Committee next week and get to work.",en,Tweet,3,52,4,10,10179.0,2025-03-24 16:14:57,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1904205252074635264/pu/vid/avc1/720x1280/kFg6h-QiaEEXRfQ0.mp4?tag=12

"Cornyn, John",Senator,Texas,,Republican,Senate: 2002-Present,Yes,JohnCornyn,'1904316820904894964',"Grok: There are numerous ways to prepare brisket, depending on culinary traditions, equipment, and personal preferences. Here are some of the most popular methods:

1. **Smoking**: A classic method, especially in Texas-style barbecue. Brisket is seasoned with a simple rub (usually salt and pepper) and slow-cooked over indirect heat from wood (like oak, hickory, or mesquite) for 10-14 hours at a low temperature (225-250°F). This creates a tender brisket with a smoky flavor and a signature ""bark"" on the outside.

2. **Braising**: Common in Jewish cuisine, brisket is seared, then slow-cooked in a covered pot with liquid (e.g., beef broth, wine, or tomato sauce) and aromatics like onions, garlic, and carrots. It’s cooked at 300-325°F for 3-4 hours until fork-tender, often served with the resulting gravy.

3. **Oven Roasting**: Similar to braising but with less liquid, this method involves seasoning the brisket, placing it in a roasting pan, and cooking it low and slow (around 275-300°F) for 4-6 hours. It can be uncovered for a crusty exterior or covered for a softer texture.

4. **Slow Cooker/Crockpot**: A convenient option where the brisket is seasoned, placed in the slow cooker with some liquid (broth, BBQ sauce, or beer), and cooked on low for 8-10 hours or high for 4-6 hours. It’s low-effort and yields a juicy result.

5. **Grilling**: Less common but viable for smaller cuts. The brisket is seasoned and cooked over indirect heat on a grill, often wrapped in foil or butcher paper partway through to retain moisture, taking 6-8 hours at low heat.

6. **Pressure Cooker/Instant Pot**: For a faster option, brisket is seared, then cooked under high pressure with liquid (e.g., broth or BBQ sauce) for about 60-90 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release. It’s tender but lacks the smoky or roasted flavor of slower methods.

7. **Sous Vide**: A modern technique where the seasoned brisket is vacuum-sealed and cooked in a water bath at a precise temperature (typically 155-165°F) for 24-36 hours. It’s then finished with a quick sear or broil for texture. This ensures consistent tenderness.

8. **Corned Beef**: Brisket is cured in a saltwater brine with spices (like peppercorns, coriander, and bay leaves) for several days, then simmered slowly for 3-4 hours. Popular in Irish-American dishes like corned beef and cabbage.

9. **Pastrami**: A variation of corned beef, where the cured brisket is coated with a spice rub (heavy on black pepper and coriander), smoked, and steamed. This is a staple in delis, especially for sandwiches.

10. **Boiling/Simmering**: A basic method where brisket is submerged in seasoned water or broth and simmered for 3-4 hours. It’s simple but less flavorful unless paired with a robust sauce or seasoning.

Beyond these, preparation can vary by:
- **Seasoning**: Dry rubs (e.g., paprika, garlic powder, cayenne), marinades, or just salt and pepper.
- **Cooking Time**: From quick pressure cooking to multi-day curing and smoking.
- **Cultural Twists**: Like Korean-inspired brisket with soy sauce and ginger, or Mexican-style with chili and lime.

In practice, there are dozens of combinations—smoked then braised, oven-roasted with a BBQ glaze, etc.—so the exact number depends on how finely you split the differences.

I don’t believe the judicial check was ever meant to be used so prolifically. It’s a necessary check, no doubt. There will often be disagreement between the Executive (charged to “execute” the law), and the courts. This is usually the fault of Congress for writing laws that are vague in nature. But that “check” cannot be a single unelected judge, effectively empowered with the same “execution” authority as the President. We must properly balance this important mechanism of checks and balances.
