Because defending democracy means action—and I’ll keep fighting to make sure it works for the people, not special interests or foreign powers.

They've chosen to operate under the cover of darkness and hide what they’re doing from the American people.

Tonight, they made massive, last-minute changes to their Big Ugly Bill. Now, they are trying to jam the bill through in the middle of the night before anyone can notice.

Here’s the truth:
➡️It rips away health care coverage from millions of Americans.
➡️It takes food assistance away from millions of kids, older Americans, and people with disabilities.
➡️It kills clean energy projects and next-generation manufacturing.
➡️It sabotages our ability to support public safety, protect national security, and close the digital divide.

Under the leadership of Biden-Harris and Congressional Democrats, our federal government failed to enforce the laws of our land and unilaterally surrendered our sovereign border to terrorist drug cartels.

On top of that, our military mission was reduced from warfighter readiness to ideological indoctrination. 

We lost the confidence of our allies, the respect of our enemies, and America's influence on the world stage. 

Unbridled spending and failed fiscal policies sent our country's economy into a tailspin. Trillions in deficit spending, trillions more in regulations, cradle-to-grave welfare without work, and an all out assault on American energy independence wreaked havoc on our economy and created the worst inflation crisis in 40 years.

In November, the American people gave President Trump a historic mandate and unified Republican leadership in Congress to reverse course on these failed policies and their disastrous consequences...

While it's not perfect, this “Big Beautiful Bill” is an important step forward. It funds our border security, bringing in thousands more ICE agents, adding new detention beds, hiring immigration judges to streamline deportations, and completing a strong, secure border wall — fulfilling our promise to keep our communities safe and our country sovereign. It protects President Trump’s historic 2017 tax cuts which sparked strong economic growth by fueling job creation and family incomes, increasing the child tax credit, and implementing new tax policies like “No Tax on Tips” and “No Tax on Overtime,” putting more money back in the pockets of hardworking Americans. This bill also has the heart of America at its core, investing billions into our great agriculture industry to ensure they can keep putting food on our tables. It emphasizes the importance, and dignity, of work by requiring able-bodied Americans to work in order to be eligible for Medicaid and food assistance. And, it also defunds planned parenthood and taxpayer funded transgender surgeries in Medicaid.

For example, Medicaid remains weighed down by misplaced priorities and state money-laundering scams. We also did not do enough to shut off the government subsidies to green energy companies.      

We owe it to our children and grandchildren to build a fiscally responsible future, and the bill could have gone much farther when it comes to getting our spending under control. On balance, however, this package is a win for the American people. But, it’s also a reminder that Washington still struggles to fully embrace the transformative change we so desperately need.

“It unleashes American energy like never before, repeals billions in subsidies for the Green New Scam, expedites permitting, and kills the radical EV mandates.
 
“It delivers the largest tax cut in American history by making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, eliminates tax on tips and overtime, and slashes taxes on Social Security payments.
 
“It sends critical resources to immigration authorities for border security and large-scale deportation efforts, finishes construction of the border wall, invests in 21st-century defense systems like the Golden Dome, restores America’s maritime dominance, and upgrades the nation’s air traffic control system.
 
“It invests in the American family by expanding the child tax credit, enhances the adoption tax credit, establishes federal savings accounts for new babies, defunds big abortion, and ends government funding for all sex-change surgeries.

An extensive amount of work went into this legislation, which will extend tax cuts for hard-working Americans, unleash American energy stifled by the Democrats’ Green New scam, and provide much-needed support for our brave Border Patrol agents. This bill also gives the administration the tools to investigate, expose and cut fraud, waste, and abuse within federal government agencies, while protecting the core services that many Americans rely upon.

This is an historic bill aimed at delivering on the mandate the American people gave us in November. Republicans have ensured that Americans can keep more of what they earn, and pay lower prices for food and gas, as a result of our pro-energy approach. Americans can also expect a return to a safer nation, as we equip Border Patrol and Homeland Security with the tools needed to expel foreign terrorists and criminals — and to keep them from returning.

"Trahan, Lori",Representative,Massachusetts,3,Democratic,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepLoriTrahan,'1925508286989643848',"BREAKING: While Americans were asleep, House Republicans passed their disastrous reconciliation bill that rips health care away from 14 million Americans – including 270,000 in Massachusetts – to bankroll tax breaks for their billionaire donors. It slashes $3.7 billion from MassHealth, threatening health care for children, seniors, and working families.

At its core, this bill is a heartless transfer of wealth from those who need help the most to those who need it the least.

Donald Trump’s so-called ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ guts SNAP benefits, taking food off the tables of thousands of families across the Commonwealth already squeezed by higher prices. Instead of closing tax loopholes for the ultra-wealthy, Republicans chose to make it harder for parents to feed their kids. It’s a shameful betrayal of the people we’re elected to serve.

Despite all their talk of fiscal responsibility, this bill – crafted in secret by Donald Trump and passed in the middle of the night by House Republicans – adds $3.8 trillion to the deficit. That reckless spending triggers automatic cuts, including nearly half a trillion dollars from Medicare.

The math doesn’t lie: this bill isn’t about helping working people – it’s about enriching the wealthy at everyone else’s expense. I voted no, and I will keep fighting to stop this dangerous bill from becoming law.

"Clyde, Andrew S.",Representative,Georgia,9,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,Rep_Clyde,'1925509487483392436',"This morning, House Republicans passed President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill with my support.

Over the past few days, I’ve worked tirelessly to improve this legislation, as it’s critical that we include as many America First priorities as possible. Budget reconciliation provides us a rare, filibuster-proof opportunity to deliver on our promises to the American people — including historic tax cuts to hardworking Americans, spending cuts, border security funding, job creation, and massive deregulation.

After productive negotiations with the White House and House GOP Leadership, we moved this legislation in a better direction. 

For example, we moved work requirements for able-bodied adults on Medicaid up to December 2026 (from the previous and unserious start in 2029). We also secured new incentives for non-Medicaid expansion states (such as Georgia) and made progress in ending Green New Scam subsidies.

One of my key priorities throughout this process has been restoring our constitutional 2A rights, which have been subjected to unconstitutional infringements for the last 90 years under the draconian NFA. The original bill text only removed the $200 transfer tax for suppressors. Now, the bill eliminates both the transfer and making tax for suppressors, as well as the registration. This is a massive 2A victory — one that takes important steps toward restoring our constitutional freedoms.

Unfortunately, the bill does not eliminate the taxation and registration of SBRs, SBSs, and AOWs. Yet we CANNOT give up. Next, this legislation will move to the Senate, providing opportunities for additional positive changes. I’ll be working closely with Senate Republicans to add this provision, and I encourage folks to stay engaged on this matter as the budget reconciliation process moves forward.

I’m encouraged that we’ve strengthened and advanced the One Big Beautiful Bill, and I look forward to working toward getting this historic legislation to President Trump’s desk.

This legislation includes key provisions that will benefit hardworking New York families.

Kathy Hochul's failed Far Left tax and spend Democrat policies.

Some additional provisions include:
 
✅ Delivering the largest tax cut in American history

✅ No tax on tips and no tax on overtime

✅ Protecting Medicaid for Americans by removing 1.4 million illegals

✅ Making permanent President Trump’s border security 

✅ Modernizing air traffic control

✅ Ending taxpayer-funded sex changes for minors

✅ Delivering tens of billions of dollars in expanded ICE detention and calls for hiring a minimum of 10,000 new ICE agents. 

✅ Including $25 billion for President Trump’s Golden Dome, a layered missile defense shield for America

✅ Holding woke, elite universities accountable by increasing the university endowment tax and subjecting the largest endowments to the corporate tax rate

✅Reversing Joe Biden’s EV mandates and CAFE standards for passenger cars and light trucks

I came to Congress to fight Washington’s out-of-control spending. It has been my top priority since my first day in office. We must save America’s future generations from financial ruin.

Congress took President Trump’s incredible policies and paired them with more Washington spending—in another “must-pass” bill.

-It does nothing to stop Washington’s out-of-control spending.

-This bill could take us from $36 trillion in debt to $56 trillion or more in 10 years.

-It drives us towards socialized medicine by omitting significant reforms to Medicaid.

-It fails to repeal Biden’s Green New Scam.

Let me be clear: President Trump is leading the most aggressive pro-America administration perhaps in our nation’s history. The issues some conservatives have in this case fall squarely at the feet of Congress.

Washington, D.C. is way out of balance right now, with one party controlling all the levers of government. This massive bill reveals the consequences of single-party control: it doesn’t balance the federal budget, it doesn’t balance the competing priorities I hear from my community, and it avoids making tough decisions in favor of making reckless ones.

It’s a package of party favors for special interests and extremists calling the shots in the majority party right now.
 
Politicians love to champion fiscal responsibility and use our national debt as a talking point, but at the end of the day, this wasteful legislation will explode our deficit by $3.8 trillion to advance profound tax cuts for the top 0.1% of earners. 
 
It drives up costs for everyday Americans on energy, healthcare premiums, and out-of-pocket costs – all while gutting the consumer finance watchdog that helps them fight back when they’re ripped off.
 
It breaks the President’s promise not to touch Medicaid – imposing new, difficult-to-navigate red tape and threatening the healthcare of roughly 21,000 people across Southwest Washington.
 
It raids food programs that advance our national health, keep food on families’ tables, and support our farmers.
 
That’s the real cost of handing out tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans.
 
As some of my House Republican colleagues sounded the alarms about how this bill will balloon our deficit, I stood ready to work with the Majority on a fiscally responsible bill that would level the playing field and make government deliver more effectively. 

Instead, they moved forward on an expensive, partisan plan that failed to include provisions like my bill to close the carried interest loophole – a fiscally smart policy advocated for by President Trump.
 
Working families understand the bitter consequences of carrying debt, and our federal government needs to meet them in that reality. 

This bill doesn’t align with the values held by my neighbors and constituents – and it disrespects their hard work to make ends meet.

And kicking illegals and dead people (fraud) off Medicaid and SNAP saves benefits FOR Americans, not takes it away.

Next up is DOGE cuts which actually reduces spending and President Trump’s executive orders, and we should be doing them every week!!!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Congresswoman Mary Miller (R-IL) released the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act:

“I was proud to cast my vote in support of President Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill,” said Congresswoman Mary Miller. “This legislation delivers on the America First agenda that a majority of Americans support. It ensures illegals are stripped of federal SNAP benefits, enforces common-sense work requirements for Medicaid, invests in mass deportation efforts, cuts taxes on tips and overtime, and dismantles Biden’s radical Green New Deal policies. The House has done its job, now the Senate must act quickly and send this bill to President Trump’s desk.”

As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Miller successfully secured a key provision in the One Big, Beautiful Bill that prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving taxpayer-funded SNAP benefits. This measure saves billions of dollars and implements a key part of President Trump's agenda.",en,Tweet,2,265,43,55,9378.0,2025-05-22 13:33:37,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrjbUudXEAA6671.jpg

"Smith, Adam",Representative,Washington,9,Democratic,House: 1997-Present,Yes,RepAdamSmith,'1925544231285727436',"I strongly oppose the Republican budget bill. This bill would balloon the national debt, slash critical services, and deliver nearly $4.6 trillion in tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans. 

At a time when families are struggling with rising costs, Congress should be strengthening the programs that invest in American communities, not cutting them to pay for permanent tax breaks for billionaires. 

The legislation proposes deep cuts to essential programs that millions of Americans rely on. It slashes health care access for 13.7 million Americans, including children, seniors, and low-income families. It also cuts food assistance from over 42 million people across the country, including essential school lunch programs for hungry children.

These devastating cuts are an attempt to partially offset the revenue losses from massive tax breaks for corporations and ultra-high earners. Under this plan, the top 0.1% of earners—those making more than $4 million a year—would receive an average tax cut of nearly $390,000 in 2026 alone. Meanwhile, the lowest-income families could see their taxes go up or their benefits cut. This tax policy is unfair and deeply unsustainable. 

Despite these harmful cuts to essential services, the bill still increases the deficit by $3.3 trillion over the next decade, further weakening our fiscal stability just as American families are dealing with higher costs and economic uncertainty. If enacted, this bill would push the national debt to $56.8 trillion by 2034—or even higher if temporary provisions are extended, as many expect. The legislation also includes a $5.5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, not to invest in our future, but to finance tax cuts that benefit those who need them the least. 

This is not a serious or responsible budget. It asks working families, veterans, and students to sacrifice, while rewarding the ultra-wealthy with permanent giveaways. I believe we need a budget that protects essential services, invests in opportunity, and restores fiscal integrity—not one that shifts the burden onto those already struggling to get by. 

I’ll continue to fight for a fairer path forward—one that puts people first and reflects the values of the communities I serve.",en,Tweet,0,7,3,4,693.0,2025-05-22 14:28:14,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Grjnd_9XEAAqDAe.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrjnfbBW8AAGw85.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrjngTTWEAA1YSt.jpg"

"Stefanik, Elise M.",Representative,New York,21,Republican,House: 2015-Present,Yes,RepStefanik,'1925553310162940333',"Today, I was proud to be the deciding vote to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill, a historic victory for New Yorkers and President @realDonaldTrump’s America First agenda. 
 
More than 77 million Americans gave House Republicans and President Trump a mandate to cut taxes, secure our borders, restore energy independence, and  deliver peace through strength.

This legislation includes key provisions that will benefit hardworking New York families. I was especially proud to work with my New York Republican colleagues to lead on delivering significant tax relief for New Yorkers by increasing the State and Local Tax cap by 300% - a win for hard working families struggling under the weight of the highest tax burden in the nation because of Gov. Kathy Hochul's failed Far Left tax and spend Democrat policies.

Some additional provisions include:
 
✅ Delivering the largest tax cut in American history

✅ No tax on tips and no tax on overtime

✅ Protecting Medicaid for Americans by removing 1.4 million illegals

✅ Making permanent President Trump’s border security 

✅ Modernizing air traffic control

✅ Ending taxpayer-funded sex changes for minors

✅ Delivering tens of billions of dollars in expanded ICE detention and calls for hiring a minimum of 10,000 new ICE agents. 

✅ Including $25 billion for President Trump’s Golden Dome, a layered missile defense shield for America

✅ Holding woke, elite universities accountable by increasing the university endowment tax and subjecting the largest endowments to the corporate tax rate

✅Reversing Joe Biden’s EV mandates and CAFE standards for passenger cars and light trucks

"McCollum, Betty",Representative,Minnesota,4,Democratic,House: 2001-Present,Yes,BettyMcCollum04,'1925557749871431800',"The ugly truth of Donald Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ is that it strips away healthcare from 20,000 Minnesotans with disabilities, seniors, children, and working parents in Minnesota’s 4th Congressional District – that’s the equivalent of every resident of Stillwater losing their healthcare overnight. The ugly truth is that 45,000 Minnesotans will go hungry without the SNAP food assistance they rely on – the equivalent of every resident of Maplewood going to bed hungry and waking up hungry. The ugly truth is that Donald Trump and his Republican Congressional followers are cutting healthcare and food access for the most vulnerable Minnesotans to give permanent tax breaks to billionaires like Elon Musk and corporations who currently don’t pay their fair share. In fact, some large corporations pay $0 in taxes. In short, the ugly truth about the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ is that it’s just another Trump GOP Tax Scam.

Under this legislation, the average family earning less than $50,000 would get under $300 in tax cuts in 2027, less than $1 a day, while a wealthy tax filer earning $1,000,000 or more a year would receive about $90,000 in tax breaks. The more the American people learn about this ugly legislation, the more they dislike it, which is why the House Republican majority advanced it through key committees during dead-of-the-night hearings and rushed the floor vote through while most Americans were sleeping.

It was easy to vote no on this bill.

"Huizenga, Bill",Representative,Michigan,4,Republican,House: 2011-Present,Yes,RepHuizenga,'1925559821517955530',"Today the House passed transformative legislation to deliver permanent tax relief for middle class families and small business job creators. 

H.R. 1 prevents the largest tax increase in history while reducing taxes for Americans making $30,000 - $80,000 by 15%. 

Additionally, this measure provides relief for seniors while delivering on President Trump’s promise of no tax on tips as well as no tax on overtime which will help Michiganders keep more of their hard earned money. This bill also makes auto loan interest on a new vehicle tax deductible, a provision that I championed to increase Michigan manufacturing and make buying a new car more affordable. 

H.R. 1  embraces pro-family and pro-parent policies by increasing the Child Tax Credit, enhancing the Adoption Tax Credit, expanding 529 savings accounts, and establishing savings accounts for newborns. 

Importantly, H.R. 1 moves to protect and preserve Medicaid for those who need it the most by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse of this vital program. 

This legislation reestablishes work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents. It stops illegal immigrants from accessing taxpayer funded assistance, cracks down on those enrolled in multiple state programs, and strives to reduce the more than $500 billion in improper payments.

Lastly, H.R. 1 makes critical investments in areas such as border security to ensure the progress made to restore border integrity is not only maintained but enhanced. 

Overall, this legislation includes more than $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, supercharges economic opportunity, and substantially increases take home pay for millions of Americans while setting up Michigan and our nation for a manufacturing renaissance!",en,Tweet,3,129,25,82,10110.0,2025-05-22 15:30:11,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

D. Prohibits funds for transgender treatments
E. Protects life by restricting Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood

2. Biden’s Green New Scam tax credits for wind and solar repealed faster

Moments like this leave a mark, and call us to act.

That’s why I introduced the Barriers to Suicide Act, a bipartisan bill I’m leading with @RepDonBeyer to fund suicide prevention infrastructure at high-risk locations like bridges and rail stations in our community and across the nation. These barriers are proven to save lives and provide a critical moment of intervention.

As Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health Task Force, this is part of the broader national effort I’m leading to tackle America’s mental health crisis with urgency and purpose—delivering real, results-driven solutions that protect communities and support those in crisis.

We can’t undo what’s been lost—but we can honor their legacy by leading with action and doing everything in our power to prevent future tragedies.

We got pretty firm commitments yesterday from the White House in the form of legislative language to help the non-expansion states under Obamacare get some additional support to try to prevent the pressure on Texas and Tennessee and Florida to expand. I think that's bad for the country. So we got 110% plus up on the state directed payments, which is important. 

We also got some commitments out of the White House to make some other changes that they might be taking some actions on at the executive level that we'll see, I think, in the coming weeks.  

We were importantly able to make sure the Inflation Reduction Act had stringent requirements on construction. So within 60 days of enactment, if you're not constructing, you're not going to get subsidies and at the back end on in service. What that means is, in short speak, it tightens down the number of subsidies that could possibly go to any more of these plussed up wind and solar projects, which are making the grid less reliable.

✅ The largest tax cuts in American history, including no taxes on tips or overtime and reduced taxes on Seniors’ Social Security.

✅ The largest investment in border security to ensure a permanently secure border.

✅ The biggest deficit reduction in nearly 30 years, achieving $1.6 trillion in mandatory savings.

✅ An unleashing of American energy dominance, paving the way for sustainable growth.

✅ Protections for Medicaid by preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits.

✅ A revolution in our defense capabilities with historic investments in cutting-edge technology, including the Golden Dome.

✅ A Made in America Auto Tax Break to support our domestic industries.

✅ An overhaul of our Air Traffic Control systems for enhanced efficiency and safety in air travel.

While we celebrate this victory, our work is far from over. I remain committed to right-sizing the government and ensuring that “we the people” have more control and freedom. I will continue to work tirelessly to promote policies that prioritize the interests of American families and strengthen our great nation.

"Roy, Chip",Representative,Texas,21,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepChipRoy,'1925590131446046776',"🚨Rep. Roy Statement on House Passage of The One Big Beautiful Bill Act:

""After much deliberation, I voted yes on H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
 
Months ago, I worked to ensure that any tax cuts or extensions would be connected to an equal or greater amount of spending cuts to force fiscal discipline. The good news is that the bill technically held true to that framework by yielding modest deficit reduction over a 10-year budget window.  Importantly, it does this by cutting spending $1.5 trillion over 10 years, reforming programs like Medicaid and SNAP with work requirements, and improving healthcare freedom by expanding health savings accounts to allow use with Direct Primary Care.
 
But the good things didn’t just happen by accident. 
 
My fellow budget hawk colleagues and I, including many in the House Freedom Caucus, forced reforms that were critical to making the bill more responsible. We:

 - Accelerated Medicaid work requirements 3 years from 2029 to 2026.

- Helped stave off further Obamacare expansion by aligning State Directed Payments (SDPs) in Medicaid to the rates of Medicare in Medicaid expansion states while allowing states that have not expanded Medicaid (ex., TX) to have SDPs at 110% of Medicare.

- Froze the state provider taxes to ensure states don’t grow their money laundering schemes.

- Paid Texas and other states back for their border efforts under the Biden administration.

- Began to claw back the “Green New Scam” put on steroids by the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) corrupt subsidies – namely by putting in place a required construction start within 60 days of enactment and a much earlier “in service” requirement of 12/31/28 – all designed to limit the reach of subsidies.

To be clear, I didn’t vote for the bill without significant reservations. 
 
For example, in classic Washington fashion, the bill produces sizable deficits in the first 5 years while achieving “savings” in the future, which means we’ve got to bring forward more savings than I already fought for.
 
And as with most major bills in Washington, this bill was rushed, mashed together, and crammed through the House without sufficient time to review every item carefully. We should do better.
 
The Medicaid money laundering scam was not reformed sufficiently, and far too many of the new green scam subsidies continue to operate.
 
And inexplicably, we funded high-tax state jurisdictions with a $350 billion tax deduction for their “SALT” tax deductions – something I strongly oppose.
 
But even though I supported this bill out of the House, this bill needs massive improvements if we are to make a dent in our deficit or to change the trajectory of this country.  
 
We must reduce deficits much further, even as we continue to work to FULLY repeal the IRA’s unreliable energy subsidies and reduce the damage done by Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.  We can do this most efficiently with state block grants – but we can also reduce the 90% FMAP for able bodied people – ensuring states are not getting seven times more money for able bodied adults with no children over the most vulnerable in traditional Medicaid – and reducing provider taxes to end the unnecessary inflation of costs in healthcare.  
 
I stand ready to work with my colleagues in the Senate to continue to get this bill right before sending it to the President’s desk.""",en,Tweet,69,1689,301,893,86118.0,2025-05-22 17:30:37,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

I stood up for New Jersey every step of the way, even when it meant standing alone or standing against my own party’s leadership.

I led the fight to restore our property tax deduction, and we won. The House bill restores the full SALT deduction for middle-class families, providing up to $40,000 in deductibility.

On healthcare, we protected Medicaid for every intended beneficiary in New Jersey and across the country and stopped illegal immigrants from stealing taxpayer-funded benefits. By rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, we can ensure that this vital program is there for current and future generations of Americans.

We also boosted the Child Tax Credit to $2,500, giving young families a much-needed return at a time when they need it most.

We secured critical relief for Somerset and Morris Counties and the whole state of New Jersey by providing tens of millions of dollars for local and state law enforcement, ensuring they are supported while protecting President Trump over the next four years.

We continued delivering for the American people by voting to secure our borders, unleash American energy and innovation, and invest in national security, all while cutting wasteful spending and making the federal government more efficient, accountable, and effective.

This bill lays the foundation for a stronger, more affordable America for middle-class families in the Seventh District, but the fight doesn’t stop here.

"Calvert, Ken",Representative,California,41,Republican,House: 1993-Present,Yes,KenCalvert,'1925603459237064910',"I promised voters that if they sent me back to Congress, I would fight to keep their taxes low – and that’s exactly what this One Big Beautiful Bill does. The passage of the bill will prevent the looming tax increase that would be the largest in our nation’s history. Job growth, take-home pay, and economic opportunities hit historic highs following the passage of the 2017 tax cuts. This bill extends and expands those pro-worker and pro-family policies.

To support American workers, the bill eliminates federal income taxes on tips and overtime. To support retirees, the bill includes new tax relief for seniors. To support families, the bill increases the state and local taxes (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 as well as extends and expands the child tax credit that Republicans doubled in 2017. To support job creators, the bill expands and makes permanent the small business deduction and allows 100% immediate expensing.

The One Big Beautiful Bill includes resources that will allow the Trump Administration to solidify the tremendous progress made in securing our border by completing the southern Border Wall and investing in our Border Patrol. To secure America and support our military, the bill will allow the Defense Department to acquire ships, aircraft, and other essential weapons systems as well as invest in the innovation entities within the Department focused on deploying vital capabilities in a time frame of relevance.

I have made it clear throughout this process that I would not support cuts to Medicaid for seniors, children, mothers, and the disabled. The One Big Beautiful Bill protects these populations and does NOT cut Medicaid for seniors, children, mothers, and the disabled. The bill makes NO changes to Social Security, Medicare, or veterans’ benefits.

The changes to Medicaid strengthen the program by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse. The bill ensures federal tax dollars are not used to provide Medicaid benefits for illegal immigrants through new immigration status check rules. The bill also implements sensible 20-hour per week work requirements – which can be satisfied through either employment, volunteering, or education – for able adults without children under 65 years of age. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the only individuals estimated to lose Medicaid benefits because of the bill are illegal immigrants, ineligible recipients who will lose coverage due to better enforcement of eligibility rules, and able adults without children who refuse to satisfy the new work requirements. These are reasonable, responsible Medicaid reforms that protect the most vulnerable as well as taxpayers.",en,Tweet,2,20,6,15,1190.0,2025-05-22 18:23:35,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

I voted YES on today’s Big Beautiful Bill Act because it’s a solid step toward restoring fiscal sanity, delivering major tax relief, and giving Tom Homan the tools he needs to deport the over three million illegal invaders Democrats snuck into our country.

This bill isn’t perfect—but thanks to the House Freedom Caucus, House leadership was pushed toward a more conservative product. And we got results.

Fiscal hawks secured over $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, locked in common-sense Medicaid work requirements, and blocked blue states from continuing their healthcare money-laundering schemes. 

There’s more work to do. ALL DOGE cuts must be enshrined into law. ALL of President Trump’s executive orders must be codified immediately. That’s how Congress can fulfill the America First mandate.

"Schneider, Bradley Scott",Representative,Illinois,10,Democratic,"House: 2013-2015, 2017-Present",Yes,RepSchneider,'1925649795290472530',"With several of my Jewish colleagues, I visited the Capital Jewish Museum to pay respects to the two young souls who were brutally, hatefully murdered last night. I thought I'd share with you what I said outside the museum, in response to this horrible, horrible murder:

Last night at this site there was a gathering sponsored by the American Jewish Committee of young professionals, diplomatic professionals, who were dedicating their careers to the idea of building bridges -- bridges between people and bridges between nations.

Jewish tradition going back to Rabbi Hillel’s famous quotation, “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am only for myself, what am I?” -- the idea that we belong together as a nation. Our motto, E Pluribus Unum, from many one. That's the ideal we all believe in and strive for every day in this city.

But there's another reality, a reality that's been true my entire life. As a young child, I remember going to synagogue on high holidays and there would be extra security, there'd be guards. In the 1970s and 80s, those guards started carrying longer guns and in the last number of years those guards have started appearing not just on the high holidays but every single day.

And in the 19 months since October 7th, 2023, we have seen a rise of antisemitism that has been unprecedented in my lifetime, so much so to the point that people are told don't wear outwards display of your faith. Wear a baseball cap instead of a yamaka. Take your Star of David and tuck it in your shirt.

There is a real fear.

So, as we gather here today, we are overwhelming… overwhelmed by emotions. Emotions of grief at the loss of two beautiful young people who were prepared to make a life together, heading to Israel to become engaged -- to make a promise to each other for a future united.

And [then they had] that future cut short last night.

Instead, their families, rather than gathering under the huppah will be gathering beside a grave saying a Kadesh instead of Seven Blessings.

We have grief. We have fear. But we're not surprised at what happened and we are not going to back down. The resolve of all of us standing here, the resolve of every American Jew, the resolve of Jews around the world is that we will hold on to who we are with pride and defiance. We know our place is in this city, in this country. For us, within the governing halls of the United States.
And we will not let anyone tell us we don't belong.

We are overwhelmed with grief for two beautiful souls, but we must be inspired by their spirit and their example. They were here last night participating in a program about reaching out. That is who they are, that is how they will be remembered.

We're here today to mark their murder, to express our sorrow but we must stand to ensure their memory is always a blessing. We cannot let their death be in vain. We must stand up against hate, against antisemitism, against efforts to divide people and instead make sure we work to unite people.",en,Tweet,2,3,0,34,10781.0,2025-05-22 21:27:42,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

"Crenshaw, Dan",Representative,Texas,2,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepDanCrenshaw,'1925667750589980925',"Los Chapitos—a faction of the Sinaloa cartel—is now aligning with CJNG, their supposed enemy, against the Mayo factions of their own cartel. A lot of these cartel civil wars come down to personal issues and power.

Ivan Guzman, El Chapo’s son, is now leading the Chapitos after Ovidio Guzman was arrested and extradited to the U.S.

But then, around the same time, 17 of Ovidio’s relatives crossed the border—and Ovidio changed his plea to guilty. Obviously there was some kind fo deal being made.

There’s been long-standing tension between the Chapitos and El Mayo factions of the Sinaloa cartel. The Chapitos live more dangerously. The Mayos are more traditional, calculating. They insulate themselves and stay out of the spotlight.

Here’s why all this matters: when cartels fight, they become vulnerable. A fractured Sinaloa cartel means an opportunity to strike. The Jalisco cartel is trying to take that opportunity.

Internal dysfunction inside the cartels is good for us, but in the end thr bad guys just move around the chess pieces a bit. To win, we acrually have to take down these groups while they’re weak and hold that territory.

The good news? We finally have presidents on both sides of the border who take this seriously.

Now we need to back that up — by equipping Mexico with the resources, intelligence, and support they need to hit these cartels hard and keep this fight as far from our country as possible.",en,Tweet,1,22,5,3,12296.0,2025-05-22 22:39:03,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrlYexqXIAA94zW.jpg

"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1925723173229588613',"(2/4) These provisions were a result of liberal ideologies, retained by some in the Republican House of Representatives, who allowed these to remain in the One Big Beautiful Bill prior to it coming to our committee. These ideologies are NOT in line with the mandate President Trump was given by the American people, and he was NOT the one who put them in the bill. 

My colleagues and I worked through the weekend, negotiating with House leadership and the White House to fix these flaws. When the revised framework came up on the evening of Sunday, May 18th, I voted “present”—not to dodge responsibility, but to honor the progress made while signaling that more work was needed. This was the first time I’ve ever voted present, and I did not do so lightly. I wanted to recognize the headway we had made in negotiations with the White House and the Speaker, relative to wind and solar tax credit reform and work requirements.

I believe in the Scripture in Matthew 5:37 which says, “Let your yes be yes, and your no be no.” In this situation, I couldn’t be a “yes,” because there were still things that had to be negotiated relative to the math working out, like SALT from the New Yorkers’ request and a hanging CBO score on the unintended consequences of Medicaid expansion.

I didn’t want to vote “no,” either, because it would kill the bill. So the four of us voted “present,” knowing it would allow the bill to move forward, with Leadership fully knowing we would continue negotiations so that I could get to a “yes” vote on the floor. This was fully explained to Leadership and the White House and we all agreed to do this before the present vote was cast.

After days of working with President Trump and the White House team, Speaker Mike Johnson, and other members of House Leadership, we made significant steps to move this legislation more in line with President Trump’s agenda so that we have the tools we need to keep his promises to the American people. 

On Monday afternoon, May 19th, I learned that transgender surgeries for adults as paid for by Medicaid was another problem that needed to be addressed in the bill. I brought this up to the Speaker Monday evening, and based on his response, it was the first he had heard of it remaining a part of the bill. I then began working with him to remove this, letting him know it was an issue for me when it went to the floor. 

Over the next couple of days, between discussions with the White House and the Speaker, we got all of this ironed out. The numbers worked out—in keeping with our budget blueprint to ensure deficit neutrality, so that we could operate in truth—and I got to a “YES.” (cont.)",en,Reply,0,3,0,0,96.0,2025-05-23 02:19:17,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1925739019343695877',"✍🏼🧵(1/4) Why I Voted Yes on the One Big Beautiful Bill 

Writing to Henry Knox in 1795 as he faced the intense national debate over the Jay Treaty, George Washington described his lack of perfect wisdom: “I have found no better guide hitherto than upright intentions, and close investigation.” Not claiming to be an infallible man, Washington relied upon his honest convictions and a close examination of the facts to guide him through difficult decisions. 

The cornerstone of upright intentions is truth.

Oklahomans rightly expect their representatives to embody upright intentions, be guided by the truth, and diligently represent them. That’s why, after a week of tough negotiations, I changed my vote on the One Big Beautiful Bill—in good conscience first voting “no” in committee, then “present” in committee to allow it to pass, and finally a “yes” on the floor after the bill was improved. I want you to know why.

When the bill first came before the House Budget Committee on May 16th, I closely examined the text as drafted by other House members, and found it didn’t deliver on several key conservative promises in keeping with President Trump’s commitments on ending the Green New Scam and meeting our Budget Committee blueprint for fiscal discipline.

After consulting @AlexEpstein—author of the book Fossil Future—and other energy experts, it was apparent that the bill failed to do a true repeal of the Green New Scam’s wind and solar tax credits. Instead of terminating these subsidies this Congress, the bill relied on future Congresses to adhere to “phaseouts” starting in 2029. The promise to start phasing out wind and solar subsidies after President Trump’s term ended was a recipe for lobbyists to circumnavigate him.   

Energy security is national security, and my conservative colleagues and I were deeply concerned that the bill did not provide a pathway to end solar and wind subsidies that prop up Chinese industries at the expense of Oklahoma’s oil and gas jobs. Oklahoma is America’s 5th largest natural gas producer, and our nation’s economy depends on energy independence—not reliance on China. Currently, China dominates the global solar supply chain and is subsidized by American dollars, as solar accounts for 61% of all new electricity generated in the United States in the last few years.

Even worse, if these subsidies are allowed to continue, we risk our electric grid becoming entirely dependent on subsidized, unreliable energy that is linked to communist China—making our grid vulnerable to CCP attacks. As reported nationally this week, Chinese tech is being found embedded in solar components connected to our grid. 

Since 1999, there have been at least ten times that Congress has promised to end the type of tax subsidies that wind and solar now enjoy, yet each time, they’ve kicked the can down the road (see below chart). In order to ensure these tax credits end, it was vital that the timeline be kept within President Trump’s term—where he would ensure the Green New Scam would end and not let lobbyists overpower Republican promises to do so. 

As Patrick Henry said, ""I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience.” Experience would tell us—as history often repeats itself—that Congress will delay on this promise yet again without President Trump to hold them accountable. I could not advance a bill that enabled this in good conscience. 

I was also gravely concerned by the lack of meaningful Medicaid reform in the bill. The old bill delayed work requirements for able-bodied citizens until 2029—a timeline that did a disservice to millions of hardworking Americans. Our no vote in committee was to address the things we knew did not align with conservative principles. (cont.)",en,Tweet,5,20,9,12,2812.0,2025-05-23 03:22:15,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrmZbnZXoAAcVey.jpg
"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1925739025450614902',"(3/4) The final bill obtains a true repeal of Green New Scam wind and solar subsidies for new projects starting 60 days after the bill is signed into law. It moves Medicaid work requirements up to 2026, restoring the dignity of work in America. And it prohibits taxpayer funds via Medicaid paying for transgender surgeries for adults. 

And again, the math works now—in keeping with our Budget Committee’s blueprint regarding CBO scores on savings in tandem with growth expectations as tied to President Trump’s first term. These important revisions clarified my decision to finally support the bill and were in line with what I know is truthful, of both my convictions and yours. I was able to have upright intentions after close examination. 

In addition to all these other things we’ve worked on, some additional victories in the bill include:

• Preventing a 24% tax hike on the average eastern Oklahoman; 
• Investing a historic $81 billion in Border Security to build the wall, increase the number of border patrol agents, and acquire technologies to prevent the flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl into our country; 
• Including the REINS Act, which prevents bureaucrats from issuing costly rules that will increase inflation and harm our economy (which I had the honor of adding to the bill in the Budget Committee); 
• Removing suppressors from the National Firearm Registry, restoring the right of law-abiding Americans to bear arms; 
• Providing tax relief for our great seniors; 
• Implementing a tax on remittances to ensure money earned in the United States goes to supporting American businesses and communities; 
• Expediting permitting to promote American energy dominance; 
• Requiring an accelerated audit of the Department of Defense 

In my discussions with the Budget Committee, their score—based upon the work of @chiproytx, @RepRalphNorman, @Rep_Clyde, and myself to negotiate these changes—would save between $100-130 billion dollars in savings over the next 10 years. Additionally, we also legitimized the previous savings that the CBO had scored relative to ending the Green New Scam, whereas before it was calculated on what was never going to happen, based on history. 

The final product is not complete as this bill now heads to the Senate. My hope is that all the good we did will hold solid moving forward. I stayed prayerful throughout this entire process, analyzing motives and truth. 

I want to thank President @realDonaldTrump and his team and @SpeakerJohnson for giving us the runway to strengthen conservative commitments in the One Big Beautiful Bill. And I am even more grateful for your trust as I continue to represent your values and, to the best of my ability, uphold the convictions we as Oklahomans hold dear.",en,Reply,1,28,5,3,1485.0,2025-05-23 03:22:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
"Brecheen, Josh",Representative,Oklahoma,2,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepBrecheen,'1925739022636179853',"(2/4) These provisions were a result of liberal ideologies, retained by some in the Republican House of Representatives, who allowed these to remain in the One Big Beautiful Bill prior to it coming to our committee. These ideologies are NOT in line with the mandate President Trump was given by the American people, and he was NOT the one who put them in the bill. 

My colleagues and I worked through the weekend, negotiating with House leadership and the White House to fix these flaws. When the revised framework came up on the evening of Sunday, May 18th, I voted “present”—not to dodge responsibility, but to honor the progress made while signaling that more work was needed. This was the first time I’ve ever voted present, and I did not do so lightly. I wanted to recognize the headway we had made in negotiations with the White House and the Speaker, relative to wind and solar tax credit reform and work requirements.

I believe in the Scripture in Matthew 5:37 which says, “Let your yes be yes, and your no be no.” In this situation, I couldn’t be a “yes,” because there were still things that had to be negotiated relative to the math working out, like SALT from the New Yorkers’ request and a hanging CBO score on the unintended consequences of Medicaid expansion.

I didn’t want to vote “no,” either, because it would kill the bill. So the four of us voted “present,” knowing it would allow the bill to move forward, with Leadership fully knowing we would continue negotiations so that I could get to a “yes” vote on the floor. This was fully explained to Leadership and the White House and we all agreed to do this before the present vote was cast.

After days of working with President Trump and the White House team, Speaker Mike Johnson, and other members of House Leadership, we made significant steps to move this legislation more in line with President Trump’s agenda so that we have the tools we need to keep his promises to the American people. 

On Monday afternoon, May 19th, I learned that transgender surgeries for adults as paid for by Medicaid was another problem that needed to be addressed in the bill. I brought this up to the Speaker Monday evening, and based on his response, it was the first he had heard of it remaining a part of the bill. I then began working with him to remove this, letting him know it was an issue for me when it went to the floor. 

Over the next couple of days, between discussions with the White House and the Speaker, we got all of this ironed out. The numbers worked out—in keeping with our budget blueprint to ensure deficit neutrality, so that we could operate in truth—and I got to a “YES.” (cont.)",en,Reply,0,5,1,1,219.0,2025-05-23 03:22:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump Administration delivered this week:

President Trump has now officially accepted a $400 million plane from the royal family of Qatar with zero oversight from Congress because Speaker Mike Johnson refuses to go against the President.

Under orders from the Trump Administration, the CDC has stopped almost all of its communications, including about disease outbreaks and health alerts. Cases of measles, salmonella, listeria, and hepatitis A and C are spreading throughout the country, but the American people are being left in the dark without knowledge of where these outbreaks are happening and how to stay safe.

The Trump Administration is deporting migrants to countries they have no connection to, this week sending migrants from Vietnam and Myanmar to South Sudan. This blatantly violates a court order that stops the deportation of migrants to third countries without due process.

Next week, the Trump Administration is launching their “Gold Card” website for people to buy U.S. citizenship for $5 million, once again proving that the Administration’s loyalties are with the ultra-rich.

In a continuation of his vendetta against higher education, the Trump Administration has revoked Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. This means the university can no longer enroll international students, and any current international students will need to transfer to a different institution to maintain their legal status.

President Trump has once again interfered in the business of Congress, tipping the scale to pass his “Big Beautiful Bill” which will be disastrous for the American people.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1925945871067173090',"Each week, we celebrate individuals across our district whose acts of selflessness and generosity inspire us all. As we approach Memorial Day, we’re proud to highlight a young leader whose actions remind us that honoring those who’ve served our nation should never be limited to just one day—it’s something we must carry forward every day through how we live and how we give back. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: 16-year-old Ryan Lovenstein of Southampton.
 
Ryan, a sophomore at William Tennent High School, grew up next door to Joseph Martines, a proud World War II Army Air Force veteran and beloved member of our community. Their friendship grew naturally—from front porch conversations and Phillies games on the radio to a shared respect that spanned generations. Through Joe, Ryan gained firsthand insight into true character, patriotism, and service.
 
When Joe passed away in 2023 at the age of 98, Ryan felt moved to ensure Joe’s legacy lived on. He built the Joseph Martines Memorial Field, a wiffleball field in his own backyard, complete with a custom scoreboard bearing Joe’s name. Quickly, the field became a community gathering place, uniting neighbors, teammates, and friends in the spirit of remembrance, friendship, and patriotism.
 
Yet Ryan’s efforts didn’t stop there.
 
Last weekend, Ryan expanded his vision, hosting the first annual Wiffle Ball for the Wounded tournament at Tamanend Park. Rallying local businesses, volunteers, and community members, Ryan raised nearly $2,000 for the @TMFoundation, an organization dedicated to supporting veterans and families of fallen service members. What began as a tribute to a single veteran has blossomed into something greater—a community movement inspired by gratitude, kindness, and service.
 
Ryan’s example reminds us that truly honoring our veterans goes beyond reflection—it requires action. He has shown us that patriotism is best expressed not through occasional gestures but through meaningful acts of kindness, service, and community spirit.
 
To Ryan—thank you for honoring our heroes. Join me in applauding this extraordinary young leader—his future is bright, and thanks to him, the legacy of one American hero now lives on in a way that brings people together and lifts us all.",en,Tweet,0,7,0,5,1511.0,2025-05-23 17:04:12,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrpVjqIXYAE0iON.jpg

In the months since, as the Vice Chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, I’ve listened closely to the many voices raised across the political spectrum, including from the prior administration and the Trump Administration.  It is clear that this unified front of concern and advocacy played a crucial role in shaping the terms, incentives, and safeguards now in place.

Thanks to this persistent and bipartisan pressure, we are in a stronger, more secure position today than we were at the time of the initial announcement.  But let me be clear: this is not the end of our oversight.  Nippon Steel must be held to every promise made – from promises to the hardworking steelworkers of Northwest Indiana and the City of Gary, to the economic and strategic interests of the United States.  We will not hesitate to act if those commitments are broken.

"Meuser, Daniel",Representative,Pennsylvania,9,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepMeuser,'1926661085735637492',"In their efforts to oppose commonsense reforms to strengthen Medicaid and ensure its sustainability for the most vulnerable and future Americans, Democrats are once again resorting to fear mongering—not facts.

Below is a breakdown of common Democratic myths and the real facts about the Big Beautiful Bill (BBB) Medicaid provisions:

⸻

DEMOCRAT FEAR MONGERING:

Millions will lose access to Medicaid under cruel new work requirements.

FACT:
The BBB’s Medicaid community engagement provisions apply only to able-bodied adults without dependents—not to seniors, people with disabilities, pregnant women, or caregivers.
Beginning January 1, 2026, these adults can meet the requirement by working, volunteering, attending school, or participating in job training for at least 80 hours a month.

This is not punitive—it’s empowering. It recognizes that Medicaid should support not just health but upward mobility and personal responsibility.

⸻

DEMOCRAT FEAR MONGERING:

Medicaid recipients will be kicked off the program due to paperwork errors and red tape.

FACT:
The BBB combats fraud, waste, and abuse, not eligible recipients.
For example, it ends the “good faith” waiver by 2030, ensuring states can no longer dodge accountability for improper payments to ineligible individuals or providers.

It uses the SSA Death Master File to prevent payments to deceased individuals and creates a federal system to prevent dual-state enrollment.

Verifying eligibility is not “red tape”—it’s responsible governance.

⸻

DEMOCRAT FEAR MONGERING:

The bill targets immigrants and punishes those in need.

FACT:
Federal law has long required that Medicaid recipients be citizens or legal residents.

The BBB strengthens enforcement by ending federal funding during the 90-day verification period for those without verified status.

No funding will go to those who are ineligible under federal law—this includes approximately 1.4 million illegal immigrants and 1.2 million other ineligible individuals who are currently on the rolls. 

⸻

DEMOCRAT FEAR MONGERING:

States will be penalized for trying to provide compassionate care.

FACT:
Beginning in 2028, states that deliberately fund health care for undocumented immigrants through Medicaid-like programs will face a 10% reduction in federal Medicaid matching funds.

This ensures that Medicaid remains focused on U.S. citizens and legal residents—the populations it was designed to serve.

⸻

DEMOCRAT FEAR MONGERING:

These changes are meant to slash Medicaid and gut funding.

FACT:
The BBB doesn’t slash Medicaid—it strengthens it.

By removing ineligible individuals and focusing resources on those truly in need, the reforms ensure long-term sustainability of the program.

Medicaid spending is projected to grow under the BBB, not shrink, because the focus is on integrity and efficiency—not cuts.

⸻

Bottom Line:
The BBB reforms don’t weaken Medicaid—they preserve it for those who need it most: vulnerable seniors, low-income children, people with disabilities, and legal working families.

Since that terrible day there have been important victories and progress made, but also terrible losses and retreats. George Floyd’s killer is paying the price for his crimes, and nothing Donald Trump can do will change that. The Minneapolis Police Department and my city will continue to make slow but meaningful steps toward reform and systemic change. Donald Trump’s Justice Department has abandoned the Consent Decree, but we will not. Congress has failed so far to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, but local communities like mine have banned no-knock warrants and the use of choke holds.
 
It is also true that across our nation the number of police killings continues to go up, and the people who are dying are much more likely to be Native, Black and Latino people. Only a fool would look at how Donald Trump lifted up White Afrikaners as the victims of genocide and see anything but the race baiting and racism that it is. Big corporations that embraced Black businesses and a more diverse workforce only a year ago have erased those efforts as they shamefully kowtow to Trump and MAGA. So, there have been retreats and losses also.

KIA: October 15, 1952 - Kangwon Province, Korea

Pfc. Pomeroy was killed while manning a machine gun to protect his platoon's flank. When the enemy attacked, he immediately opened fire on the advancing troops, inflicting a heavy toll in casualties and blunting the assault. The enemy attempted to neutralize his gun, and despite suffering severe wounds and seeing his gun mount destroyed by mortar fire, he took the heavy weapon in his arms and continued to rake the attackers.

When his ammunition was expended he used his machine gun as a club and was mortally wounded in hand-to-hand combat. His actions maintained the integrity of his platoon's perimeter and contained the enemy attack. Pfc. Pomeroy was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

Pomeroy was featured in Conor Timmis's Korean War documentary ""Finnigan's War.""

On this Memorial Day, we should also reflect on the “Stalin of our time,” mass murderer Putin, and his most recent attack on #Ukraine Sunday — the largest of his war: 367 drones and missiles, which killed at least 12 people and injured dozens. This casts a dark shadow over the otherwise hopeful news of nearly 1,000 prisoners exchanged on each side.

European and US leaders should double down on sanctions against #Russia, ending the fact that nearly 70% of their banking system remains “unsanctioned!” The President should use the full power of the #REPO Act to convert frozen Russian assets into funds for Ukraine’s defense and reconstruction, including funding a portion of our strategic minerals agreement.

We must increase the pressure on Russia:
· Impose secondary sanctions
· Enforce the REPO Act
· Shut down the Russian oil trade
· Ensure Ukraine has arms for its defense
· Tell the world how Iran, North Korea, and China are complicit in killing the free people of Ukraine

Additionally, we legitimized another $500 billion that (before the change) was simply funny math.

The below information shows how the savings will occur and details the specific policy wins I fought for: 

1. It obtains a true repeal of Green New Scam wind and solar subsidies for new projects starting 60 days after the bill is signed into law. 

2. We legitimized the previous savings ($500 billion!) that the CBO had scored relative to SUPPOSEDLY ending the Green New Scam provisions. THIS $500 BILLION IS A TRUE SAVINGS NOW!!!

Thank you as well to Julianne Flynn, Executive Director of VA South Texas Health Care, and John Mendoza, Deputy Medical Center Director of VA South Texas Health Care, for your leadership and steadfast support of our veterans and their families.

To the veterans who joined us, to the Gold Star families whose strength humbles us all, and to the men and women of the Department of Veterans Affairs, your presence was a powerful tribute to those we came to remember. Your continued service and sacrifice speak volumes.

On this Memorial Day, communities across the country paused to reflect. But there, among the headstones, we did more than remember. We honored. We recommitted ourselves to the values these men and women lived and died for.

Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery stands as more than a final resting place. It is a powerful testament to the legacy of those who served our nation with courage and conviction. Each grave told a story of someone who believed in something greater than themselves.

As a proud Texan and member of Congress, I was reminded once again how deeply service is woven into the fabric of our state. In San Antonio, Military City USA, service is not just a tradition. It is a way of life.

To the families of the fallen, your quiet strength and grace reminded us all what it means to carry the weight of loss with dignity. Your sacrifice will never be forgotten. We must ensure that the values these heroes defended remain at the heart of our nation.

We've gotten a ton of questions on what's NEXT. Here's a breakdown:

This week, @SenateGOP will begin to ""scrub"" the 1,000+ page bill to comply with something called the Byrd rule. 

I’ve called it the “Byrd Bath.” 

In short: because reconciliation (this bill) is a fast-track process that only requires 51 Senate votes versus 60, there are strict rules for compliance. The bill must directly impact federal spending or taxes.

For example, liberals previously tried to use their own reconciliation process to give mass amnesty to illegal aliens, but they FAILED (aka, it didn't pass the Byrd rule) because it would've been a huge policy change that outweighed budget impact.

Note: The House is NOT bound by the Byrd rule—only we are. I've used this example: the House has to fit through a garage door, the Senate has to squeeze through a window in the garage door. 

It just comes down to process. We’ve got one shot to get it right. President Trump knows about the Byrd rule, and we're in 24/7 communication to PASS THE BILL and DELIVER.",en,Tweet,408,12271,2576,1440,440257.0,2025-05-27 14:26:14,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

For example, currently there is a massive need for a new refrigerant forced on the HVAC industry because of climate hoax lies.

R-410A which has been an incredibly reliable and inexpensive refrigerant is being phased out and R-454B is the new refrigerant that everyone has to buy, but can barely find.

The shortage and supply of R-454B is driving the cost as high as $1,000 dollars for a 20 pound jug compared to  an avg cost of $300 for a 25 pound jug of R-410A.

In other words, the Biden administration and climate hoaxers were able to pass regulations with the Green New Deal that will now drive the cost of your air conditioning and may lead to you getting bad news from the repair man that won’t be able to provide the refrigerant you need immediately in the high heat this summer.

One was for a lifetime of public service and the other for preserving the legacy of our shared history.

First, I recognized Mayor Dr. Victor D. Treviño for his decades of unwavering service to the people of Laredo. From his roots at Nixon High School to his leadership as our City Health Authority during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mayor Treviño has always led with compassion, humility, and purpose. His efforts, including a binational vaccination campaign that administered nearly 300,000 vaccines, saved lives and brought communities together in a time of crisis. Today, I proudly presented him with a Congressional Record entry to honor his lifelong dedication to public health and service.

I also had the honor of recognizing the Order of Granaderos y Damas de Gálvez as they celebrate 50 years of preserving and promoting the vital but often overlooked role Spain played in the American Revolution. From their beginnings in San Antonio to the continued work of the Laredo Chapter, their mission is clear: to ensure that figures like General Bernardo de Gálvez are remembered for their courageous contributions to our nation’s founding. Their efforts earned them a well-deserved entry into the Congressional Record as well.

This ceremony was a meaningful acknowledgment of the individuals and organizations whose work strengthens our community, whether through public service or the preservation of history.
