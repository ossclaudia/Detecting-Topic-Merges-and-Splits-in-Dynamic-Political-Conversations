Defended by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division, the town was under heavy siege, facing shortages of supplies amid harsh weather and constant German attacks. When asked to surrender, Brigadier General Anthony C. MacAuliffe famously responded with a single word: ""Nuts.""

Patton, known for his audacity, swiftly maneuvered his 3rd Army in a dramatic 90-degree turn, breaking through German lines to reach Bastogne. This timely intervention not only lifted the siege but also helped shift the momentum of the battle. Patton’s success played a key role in pushing the German forces back, eventually driving them eastward across the Rhine River, and marking a turning point in the Battle of the Bulge.",en,Tweet,1,124,21,17,10967.0,2024-12-26 12:50:02,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gfud0zOXMAA3LQc.jpg

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1872665199490076875',"Good gracious, I came out of Christmas bliss to see arguments about American labor vs H1-B imported labor and MAGA split over this issue.

Good, that means everyone is engaged in saving this country.

Here is some tough reality for some of you:

There are some big MAGA voices with large social media platforms throwing down their opinions yet they have never run a company that relies on thousands of skilled/highly trained workers with a constant need for reliable labor yet they claim authority over the subject matter.

When you spend years trying to constantly hire/train/maintain a good reliable workforce, which is a 24/7 never ending cycle, your real world experience will produce an opinion based on reality and all of your followers on X don’t translate to this.

Having owned a construction company for decades (yes I’m that old), I know firsthand our workforce issues.

However, I fully believe we must make the hard and necessary changes here in the U.S. to educate, build, and facilitate a solid foundation of knowledgeable, highly skilled, talented, well paid, AMERICAN workers. 

Not having this is like having a crumbling foundation in our house and currently we are importing foreigners to hold up the foundation walls and plug the leaks. 

Too many of our young people, are killing their bodies and minds on alcohol and drugs, wasting years and money earning useless college degrees, chasing unrealistic dreams, spending all their time trying to be the next you tuber/content creator/social media influencer instead of pursuing a useful skill set/trade/education in order to become a part of our much needed American workforce. 

If you fall in this category, put down the selfie light, and go apply for a job and replace the H1-B visa holders and all the other skilled labor jobs that foreign workers are taking and American companies are desperately trying to hire.

It’s called building a career, you work your way up.

In order to go forward we must change our education system, create a culture that respects hard work and productivity, cut government waste/spending/regulations in order to produce a healthy robust economy that lowers inflation and pays higher wages to an American workforce, so that H1-B is no longer needed and can be done away with.

Decades of America LAST bad decisions in Washington wove a giant web of America LAST policies that created systems and structures that must be torn down and rebuilt to put America FIRST.

This requires everyone’s help to change it and we will all have to do what it takes to get it done.

It won’t be easy and it won’t be as quick as we like, but we can do it TOGETHER and the results will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN but EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE!!!",en,Tweet,2375,38380,6341,8381,4000040.0,2024-12-27 15:25:50,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Today, we honor an extraordinary collaboration that showcases the boundless strength of compassion and the transformative power of community. This week’s Hometown Heroes are the Northampton, Neshaminy, Middletown, and Bristol Senior Centers, along with the Bucks County Sheriff's Community Outreach Unit.
 
Together, this remarkable group of Seniors and law enforcement officers united to confront an urgent and often overlooked crisis: providing critical support to our homeless community during the coldest months of the year. For those without shelter, these unforgiving temperatures are not merely uncomfortable; they are life-threatening. A warm coat, sturdy shoes, or even a simple blanket can mean the difference between life and death.
 
Recognizing this dire need, they joined forces through the Sheriff's Help for the Holidays initiative, collecting and donating hundreds of winter necessities—coats, gloves, scarves, blankets, shoes, and more. Last Friday, CPL Todd Kessler and Deputy Dion Thomas joined Venus Johnson of the Reach Out Foundation, Rodney Wyatt of Salute 2 Service, members of the Bucks County Park Rangers, and Matt Allen, Director of Veterans Affairs, to deliver these vital resources directly to those in need. What they gave was not just warmth for the body but an uplifting message of hope, support, and holiday magic.
 
This effort was more than a seasonal gesture of kindness—it was a shining example of what makes Bucks County extraordinary. It highlighted the boundless generosity of our Seniors, the backbone of our community, and the exceptional commitment of our hero law enforcement officers, who demonstrated that when we work together, we can transform even the smallest gestures into a powerful beacon of hope.

A strong advocate for states' rights and the agrarian South, Calhoun served as Secretary of War under James Monroe and briefly ran for president in 1824, before being forced out by partisan attacks. He became vice president under John Quincy Adams in 1824 and was re-elected in 1828 alongside Jackson. 

However, Calhoun soon became politically isolated from Jackson’s administration regarding the high tariff stance on imported goods preferred by the quickly industrializing North. Calhoun argued for nullification, allowing states to ignore federal laws they thought were unconstitutional. President Jackson declared nullification as treasonous and threatened military force when South Carolina declared tariffs null and void within the state. To remain loyal to his home state of South Carolina, Calhoun decided to represent the interests of the state in the Senate.

Later, he served as the Governor of Georgia before being elected as President of the United States. He was the author of 32 books and the co-founder of the Carter Center, a non-profit public policy organization involved in a wide variety of efforts to help resolve international conflicts and promote democracy. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. In his spare time, President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, worked to build or repair over 4,000 homes through Habitat for Humanity, according to that organization. And if ALL THAT weren't enough, he taught Sunday school and was a deacon in his church in Plains, Georgia.

"Jackson, Jonathan L.",Representative,Illinois,1,Democratic,House: 2023-Present,Yes,rep_jackson,'1873545377288523836',"Statement from Congressman Jonathan Jackson on the Passing of Former President Jimmy Carter

Today, we grieve the passing of Former President Jimmy Carter, a leader of unparalleled integrity and compassion who devoted his life to the pursuit of justice, equality, and peace. At 100 years old, he leaves behind a legacy that profoundly shaped our nation and the world.

President Carter’s dedication to civil rights was evident in his actions both before and during his presidency. As Governor of Georgia, he called for an end to segregation and publicly declared that the time for racial discrimination had passed. His bold leadership in the South during a time of immense tension sent a powerful message of inclusion and progress.

As president, Jimmy Carter demonstrated a deep commitment to addressing systemic inequalities affecting Black communities. His administration significantly increased federal appointments of African Americans to high-ranking positions, creating opportunities for representation in spaces of power. He also expanded funding for historically Black colleges and universities, understanding that education is a cornerstone of opportunity.

President Carter worked closely with my father, Reverend Jesse Jackson, to empower marginalized communities and advance the cause of economic justice. Their collaboration helped secure greater access to federal resources for minority-owned businesses, particularly through the Minority Business Development Agency, which Carter strengthened during his presidency. Together, they emphasized the importance of uplifting underserved communities through economic inclusion, employment opportunities, and community investment.

Beyond his presidency, President Carter continued to work alongside civil rights leaders like my father. He joined efforts to mediate racial and economic disparities, offering his wisdom and influence to bring people together in pursuit of equality. His efforts through the Carter Center tackled issues like voter suppression, housing insecurity, and global poverty, which disproportionately affect communities of color. His hands-on involvement with Habitat for Humanity built not just homes, but hope, for families striving for a better future.

Meanwhile, Republicans in the House retained the majority with a narrow margin. Our takeaway is clear: the mandate from the American people lies with President @realDonaldTrump, and his America First agenda is what the American people want.

Individual House Republicans do not get to use our slim majority as a political tool to hold President Trump’s agenda hostage. President Trump only has four years to get us back on track. That means on Day 1 we must all be prepared to work to enact Trump’s agenda, not to critique, slow walk it, or even block it from happening. That is what the Democrats will try to do at every turn. The defectors in Congress should not be Republicans who think they know better than the candidate who just won the popular vote and every single swing state, carrying many Rs to victory with him. 

Today President Trump offered his complete and total endorsement for Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House. I will proudly stand alongside President Trump and support @SpeakerJohnson. President Trump has a plan, and he needs us in Congress to work together to make that plan a reality. 

Lastly, I will say this. One cannot be America First and then defy the America First President. Members of Congress thinking they know better than President Trump will be the reason we do not deliver for the American people. We have one opportunity to save this country, but we have to work together to do that.

The 50-mile canal, linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, had been in U.S. hands since its completion in 1914. Over one million ships had passed through the canal by then.

The idea of a canal across Panama dates back to the early 1500s, with various plans proposed but never realized. U.S. interest grew in the mid-1800s, spurred by the California Gold Rush and the need for a shortcut between the oceans.

President Theodore Roosevelt pushed for the project, and in 1903, Panama gained independence from Colombia with U.S. support. The U.S. and Panama signed the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, giving the U.S. control of the canal zone in exchange for a $10 million payment and annual rent.

In 1977, after decades of Panamanian protests, the Torrijos-Carter Treaties were signed, setting the stage for the 1999 handover. The treaties gave the U.S. the right to defend the canal's neutrality but handed control to Panama.",en,Tweet,2,34,9,16,4781.0,2024-12-31 11:52:11,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgIAiILXsAAVCcv.jpg

"Massie, Thomas",Representative,Kentucky,4,Republican,House: 2012-Present,Yes,RepThomasMassie,'1874173000993415574',"Challenge accepted.

First let me note that the “vote for Mike” camp is not trying to make the case that Mike Johnson is endowed with the qualities necessary to lead our conference. Even you have limited yourself here to procedural justifications for his speakership rather than telling us why he is a good or capable leader.

Even if Mike’s entire goal is to do everything Trump wants without debate or question (which I would argue is not healthy for the institution of Congress), he’s not going to be good at it. He already demonstrated this month that he won’t tell the President what is achievable and what is not achievable in the House, and he lacks the situational awareness himself to know what can pass and what cannot.

1. “What do we hope to gain?”
A competent Speaker who has the will and the ability to capitalize on this once in a decade opportunity. Johnson is not up for this task. Also, we want a Speaker who inspires the public and who can make our case in the media, so we can keep the majority for the second half of Trump’s term. Johnson nearly led us to the minority in what was a banner year for Trump. He is certain to lose us the majority in 2026.

2. “No one can get more votes.”
It’s somewhat ridiculous to assert that Mike Johnson is the only member of Congress electable to Speaker. He was only electable the first time because he hadn’t held any type of leadership position, nor had he ever fought for anything, so no one disliked him and everyone was tired of voting. He won by being the least objectionable candidate, and he no longer possesses that title.

3. “Risk crippling Trump’s win.”
This is argument is a scare tactic, meant to stampede the masses, plain and simple. There is no legal or parliamentary argument for nullifying the national election if a speaker is not in place on January 6th.

4. “They are allies of the democrats”
Actually it is Mike Johnson who routinely passes  major legislation (Ukraine, Omnibus, FISA spying) with only a minority of republicans, and relying on most democrats. He also owes his current speakership to the democrats. Here’s the roll call for the motion to table the motion to vacate last summer. Pelosi and Jeffries teamed up to save Johnson:
