Today, we honor an extraordinary woman whose unwavering compassion and commitment are a testament to the power of one person‚Äôs determination to change the world‚Äîmeet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero, Fran Held, of Lansdale.

From an early age, Fran was drawn to helping others‚Äîworking tirelessly to address homelessness, poverty, and food insecurity wherever she could. For years, she served without fanfare or recognition, simply answering the call of those in need. But one day, Fran received a phone call that changed everything.

The voice on the other end said, ‚ÄúI heard you‚Äôre the lady who will help me when no one else will.‚Äù In that moment, Fran realized her calling was not just a passion but a mission. She understood then that although she didn‚Äôt have vast financial resources, she had something even more powerful‚Äîa heart willing to act.

In 2009, Fran turned compassion into action by founding Mitzvah Circle, a nonprofit dedicated to restoring dignity and hope for families facing extraordinary hardships.

Today, Mitzvah Circle serves over 73,000 families annually, distributing 4.5 million essential items‚Äîincluding 3 million diapers‚Äîto address urgent needs. With 1 in 3 American families unable to afford diapers, the organization provides critical supplies like wipes and baby essentials to protect children‚Äôs health and help parents return to work.

But Mitzvah Circle goes further, offering over 100 necessities‚Äîclothing, school supplies, toiletries‚Äîproviding essential support and empowering families to regain stability and build brighter futures.

In addition, their Teen Ambassador Program provides an invaluable opportunity for high school students to make a meaningful impact while cultivating essential leadership skills that will serve them, our community, and country for a lifetime.

Mitzvah Circle‚Äôs impact is a community effort, with partnerships spanning nearly 300 organizations and the dedication of more than 4,200 volunteers each year. From churches and synagogues to mosques and civic groups, Fran has worked to build bridges that unite people across faiths and backgrounds in the common mission of kindness and care. In Fran‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to change your entire life to make an impact. One act of kindness can change everything for someone.‚Äù

Fran‚Äôs unwavering dedication has built a brighter future for thousands. She has shown us that compassion is the cornerstone of a strong community, and her leadership continues to inspire us to build a better world‚Äîone act of kindness at a time.

1. Create a working group comprised of independent experts ‚Äì not corrupted by lobbyists and special interests ‚Äì to work with DOGE¬†and our committees¬†on implementing recommended government and spending reforms to protect the American taxpayer. 

2. Task that working group with reviewing existing audits of federal agencies and entities created by Congress ‚Äì and issuing a report to my office for public release. 

3. Request¬†House committees undertake aggressive authorizations and appropriations reviews, including providing additional resources where needed, to expose irresponsible or illegal practices and hold agencies/individuals accountable that have weaponized government against the American people. ¬† 

If we want to¬†restore¬†fiscal responsibility, we must start by being transparent about the dollars that are spent, address the issues we find, and then hold those accountable who have misspent funds.

"Meuser, Daniel",Representative,Pennsylvania,9,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepMeuser,'1875233281488384249',"President Biden‚Äôs decision to block the U.S. Steel-Nippon Steel Deal is a significant blow to Pennsylvania and the American steel industry. This $14.9 billion investment would have made U.S. Steel the largest producer in America, created nearly 6,000 new jobs, and modernized plants with $2.7 billion in cutting-edge upgrades‚Äîall while keeping production in Pennsylvania. Japan is a trusted ally, not an adversary like China.

Our hope and expectation is President Trump will step in, review this investment in a business-minded way as only he can, and hopefully save U.S. Steel while making it better for America. Revitalizing industries, securing jobs, and protecting American workers is his specialty, and much of Pennsylvania‚Äôs steel manufacturing future is at stake. We hope President Trump can save U.S. Steel for the second time and have Japan pay for it.

Before Colt's mass production of revolvers, handguns were rare and impractical, often expensive, inaccurate, and preferred mostly by elites for formal duels. The average American, especially in the West, favored knives for self-defense. This changed with Colt's invention of the percussion-repeating revolver, which featured a revolving chamber holding multiple shots, making it more practical for quick combat. While not as accurate as rifles, the revolver's rapid-fire ability made up for this shortcoming.

Colt's early success was fueled by government contracts, which allowed him to scale production. Colt developed mass production techniques, reducing costs and making revolvers more affordable. Colt‚Äôs guns became popular during the California Gold Rush, and by 1860, he had sold over 268,000 revolvers, largely to civilians seeking self-defense in the Wild West.",en,Tweet,1,50,6,7,3450.0,2025-01-04 12:35:49,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ggcw3_AXEAAWwEs.jpg

I‚Äôm grateful to share that the bill I introduced to name the U.S. post office in downtown Corpus Christi after one of our community's most remarkable heroes, Captain Robert E. ‚ÄòBob‚Äô Batterson, was signed into law by the President‚Äîensuring his legacy of service and sacrifice will be remembered for generations to come.

Captain Robert E. ‚ÄòBob‚Äô Batterson was a true American hero who dedicated 35 years of his life to serving our nation in the U.S. Navy. His remarkable career began when he enlisted in 1939 and included being stationed at Pearl Harbor during the attack on December 7, 1941‚Äîone of the most pivotal moments in American history. Following that, he earned his wings at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and served as a Navy Aviator during World War II, piloting F6F Hellcats in defense of our nation. After the war, he transitioned to the Navy‚Äôs Supply Corps, continuing his service until retiring in 1974.

In retirement, he remained deeply committed to serving his community, spending 26 years volunteering at the U.S.S. Lexington Museum in Corpus Christi. His dedication inspired visitors from near and far, especially at the Pearl Harbor exhibit, where he preserved the memory of those who served and sacrificed for our freedoms. Captain Batterson‚Äôs life exemplified service, sacrifice, and a love for his country and community. Naming this post office after him ensures his legacy will live on for generations.

May his story continue to inspire us all who walk through its doors, and may God bless the Batterson family. üá∫üá∏",en,Tweet,0,25,3,3,1256.0,2025-01-06 15:36:00,"<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web Client</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgnSC75XcAAnpIQ.jpg

"Murkowski, Lisa",Senator,Alaska,,Republican,Senate: 2002-Present,Yes,lisamurkowski,'1876415981024956745',"Earlier today, President Biden signed two memoranda withdrawing a total of 625 million acres of the federal Outer Continental Shelf‚Äîincluding the entire East Coast, the West Coast, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and tens of millions more acres off of Alaska‚Äîfrom potential oil and gas development.

I have long agreed that not all offshore areas need to be available for development at all times, and that some areas merit more permanent protections. I also understand the desire of Alaska Tribes in the Bering Straits region to prevent any oil and gas development in their nearby waters, as unlikely as that may be.

Still, my objection to the President‚Äôs actions today is two-fold. First, in Alaska, we continue to see a one-way ratchet where more and more of our federal OCS is taken off the table, while nothing is done to promote development even where it is needed and supported. Cook Inlet is a good example: instead of working with Alaskans to prevent looming energy shortages in Southcentral, the administration has actively worked against our ability to produce more natural gas from that basin. What we have faced over the past four years is an unbalanced policy that has left us on the verge of importing LNG.

I also object to the manner in which this announcement was made‚Äîpost-election, at the 11th hour, and unilaterally through executive action. These withdrawals are sweeping, limiting the options that future administrations and Congresses have for where our energy should be produced and preventing more thoughtful decisions about what should be made available in each five-year national leasing program.

I understand that President Biden is trying to burnish his environmental legacy, but this is the wrong way to do it.",en,Tweet,18,393,62,257,30521.0,2025-01-06 23:50:06,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
