First, to implement bipartisan ‚Äúcourage metrics‚Äù based on actual floor votes, to ensure that bipartisanship and independent voting is a 50-50 two-way street. 

And second, to enshrine mandatory term limits for Caucus leadership, to afford everyone in the Caucus the opportunity to lead and to prevent Caucus ‚Äúdictatorships.‚Äù These two legacy-defining issues have been my #1 priority, to ensure that our 100% focus is on the good of the Caucus, the good of Bipartisanship, and the good of our Country, not the good of the individual.

The President has given Musk broad, sweeping power with no clear definition or boundary. Musk is using that power in ways both illegal and destructive.

He has blocked payments duly approved by Congress and signed into law by the President. This is illegal. He has completely shut down U.S. foreign aid, blocking payments of programs already approved that millions of people across the world are counting on for food security and health care among other needs. Agencies providing crucial services to people in desperate circumstances are headed into bankruptcy as a result of these funds being cut off.

He is also randomly threatening or firing thousands of government employees in ways that jeopardize their ability to do their jobs and may also violate employment law. Just days before the fatal plane crash in Washington D.C., Musk‚Äôs DOGE task force offered all FAA employees eight month‚Äôs pay in exchange for quitting, leaving them to wonder if they might be fired at some point if they didn‚Äôt accept the offer. Chaos, uncertainty and threats are making it impossible for federal employees to do their jobs in far too many instances.

I strongly support the idea of making government more efficient and more effective.

It‚Äôs time to pull the REINS on regulatory overreach. 

Today, I joined @SenRandPaul to introduce the Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act for the 119th Congress. 

This legislation would require that federal regulations with an economic impact of $100 million or more be subject to an up-or-down vote in Congress, reclaiming legislative power from the regulatory state.

Without the REINS Act, Americans will continue to live under the tyranny of unelected bureaucrats who effectively make laws but never have to stand for election. 

But with REINS, Congress has an opportunity to restore its constitutional lawmaking role while saving countless American workers, consumers, businesses, and families from the costs imposed by endless federal regulations.

We cannot allow future administrations to undo the great achievements and reforms of the federal government that President Trump is making today.

As someone who has long advocated for and worked with experts for several years on safety reforms and modernizations of our aviation systems, I strongly encourage Mr. Musk, whose own company has a troubling safety record, to leave this work to the experts.

Part of that promise was to have the most successful entrepreneur *in the world* tackle government waste, fraud, & abuse. This isn't a surprise! Trump made this promise on the trail *with* Elon, and @POTUS went on to dominate the 2024 election. 

I remind the Dems: Trump won every swing state, the popular vote, and he helped deliver a @SenateGOP and @HouseGOP majority. A clean sweep.

I've been in business for 25+ years. Successful companies across the world bring in consultants. Trump knows this. He wrote the Art of the Deal. Now, we have the BEST consultant offering to give us suggestions to save taxpayer dollars. 

What are liberals doing in response? Defending USAID's funding of DEI musicals in Ireland, LGBT activism and sex changes in Guatemala, and transgender comic books in Peru. Either you agree with this use of taxpayer dollars, or you don't. If you think it's a waste: you can thank President Trump and the team he's assembled!

-The President claimed future ownership of Gaza with the intent of removing Palestinians and developing the ""Riviera of the Mideast."" This is in direct violation of international laws and treaties, which the United States is a part of. 
-Election denier Pam Bondi was confirmed as Attorney General, the nation's top law enforcement officer, who then promptly ended the task force focused on foreign election interference. 
-Known Russian sympathizer Tulsi Gabbard was confirmed as Director of National Intelligence and is now in charge of 18 agencies, a $76B annual budget, and every single one of our national secrets.

After years of Biden's open border policies, these drugs are pouring in from Mexico, using raw materials from China. The crisis is only worsening, and letting the Schedule I classification expire would be reckless.

This bill is about saving lives and holding traffickers accountable.

A Levittown native and Neshaminy High School graduate, Anna was more than a public servant‚Äîshe was a champion for her neighbors, a tireless advocate for the most vulnerable, and a fearless leader who turned her battles into a mission to uplift others. She didn‚Äôt just believe in community‚Äîshe built it, strengthened it, and fought for it every day.
¬†
Diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at a young age, Anna understood struggle but refused to be defined by it. Instead, it inspired her to work tirelessly to make life better for others. Through her leadership as Vice Chair of the @PARareDisease and as the founder of the Bucks County Cystic Fibrosis Alliance, Anna gave hope to countless families and individuals in our community. As Middletown Township Supervisor, she was a fierce and effective leader, working to make our community stronger, safer, and more connected, championing initiatives that enhanced local infrastructure, protected public safety, and bettered our community.
¬†
Even after her stage-four colon cancer diagnosis in 2021, Anna never wavered in her commitment to our community. Through unimaginable adversity, she continued showing up‚Äîproving time and time again that her dedication, resilience, and heart knew no bounds. Her impact stretched far beyond the halls of government; she was a mentor, a friend, and a guiding light to all who knew her. Through her tireless healthcare advocacy, unwavering commitment to local initiatives, and extraordinary ability to unite people, Anna exemplified the best of Bucks County.
¬†
Today, we mourn the loss of a true hometown hero, but more importantly,¬† we celebrate a legacy that will never fade and honor a life of service and unyielding determination. Please join me in honoring Anna‚Äîa woman whose strength, service, and spirit will forever be woven into the fabric of our community.",en,Tweet,1,16,2,3,1354.0,2025-02-07 17:27:35,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1887916027142340608/vid/avc1/720x900/zEV2C_vHO5dxcNxF.mp4?tag=16

Today, I called on Pennsylvania DEP Acting Secretary Shirley and Pennsylvania DOH Secretary Bogen for immediate answers and action regarding this ongoing pipeline leak. Jet fuel contamination has been detected in private wells, test results have been delayed, and residents are left unsure if their water is safe to drink.

Pennsylvania's Constitution guarantees the right to clean air and pure water‚Äîa right that is now in jeopardy, and that is unacceptable.

The health and safety of our community is my top priority, and I will not stop working until every affected resident receives the answers, accountability, and action they deserve.

This week, the Senate Budget Committee will mark up a budget resolution that begins the process of a reconciliation bill that will provide $175 billion to secure the border. We are working hand in glove with the Trump Administration -- $175 billion is the exact amount requested by the Trump team.

We will also provide $150 billion in new military spending at a time of great need and even greater threats. These outlays will be paid for by reducing spending in other areas of the federal government just as I promised.

In 1765, Britain was still struggling financially as a result of the French and Indian War, so to raise enough revenue, the Stamp Act was introduced. This tax required a stamp to be placed on various legal documents, newspapers, and other materials in the American colonies. It was the first direct tax levied by the British government on the colonies.

In Virginia, Patrick Henry led the Virginia Resolves, which argued that only the Virginia Assembly could impose taxes on its people. This sentiment fueled the idea of ""no taxation without representation."" The Virginia Resolves sparked broader colonial resistance, leading to the Stamp Act Congress in New York, where delegates outlined their objections to the British government.

In January, along with a bipartisan, bicameral group of my colleagues, I called on the State Department to redouble its efforts to secure Marc‚Äôs freedom, pressing for unwavering diplomatic action to bring him home. I want to thank @SecRubio, President Trump, and Special Envoy Witkoff for their leadership and shared commitment to ensuring no American is ever abandoned to injustice. Today, we celebrate Marc‚Äôs long-awaited return and reaffirm a fundamental truth: the United States stands by its citizens, and we will never stop fighting to bring every wrongfully detained American back where they belong.",en,Tweet,1,10,3,4,1939.0,2025-02-11 19:29:20,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gjh77TZWAAADO4S.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gjh77TZXEAAcfEz.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gjh77TZXQAEYV6Q.jpg"
