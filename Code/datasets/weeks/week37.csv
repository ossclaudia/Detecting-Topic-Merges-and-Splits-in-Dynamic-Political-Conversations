Those who criticize the bill for not reducing spending enough ‚Äì I understand your point and I agree. To those who believe we must pass some version of the bill by July 4th, you‚Äôre dead right.

Making the tax cuts permanent, increasing defense spending and providing money to secure our border is an essential part of this bill, and it needs to be passed now.
¬†
When it comes to spending reductions, here‚Äôs the reality:
¬†
‚úÖ The reconciliation process is focused only on mandatory spending. By law, changes to Social Security cannot be a part of reconciliation.
¬†
‚úÖ Medicare has been virtually untouched in both the House and Senate proposals. Medicaid reforms like work requirements and dealing with the provider tax scam are sources of legitimate savings without reducing benefits for those who need it. Medicaid spending has grown by nearly 50% in the last 5 years and it is now time to address this problem.
¬†
‚úÖ We can improve this bill in terms of cost savings. But it‚Äôs important to note we have two more reconciliation bills available to us to reduce spending further and define additional tax cuts.

Consider this:

- The Atlanta Fed‚Äôs most recent GDP estimate for Q2 is 4.6%!
- We are in the middle of an AI revolution.
- We are on the cusp of a robotics revolution.
- We have 8 Trillion dollars of new investment committed to the U.S. over the new several years. To put this into context, the U.S. GDP is approximately 28 Trillion, making this incremental investment commitment so large it actually dwarfs the entire 10 year CBO growth projection on its own.

The bottom line is that the CBO scoring for GDP is clearly flawed, and is being used to mislead the public. The One Big Beautiful Bill is pro-growth, responsible legislation that helps put us on a better track.

Here's what you need to know ‚¨áÔ∏è

FACT: President Trump's 'One Big, Beautiful Bill' was designed by the President himself, his team, and his closest MAGA allies in Congress to deliver the MAGA agenda. 

This is the President's vision.

No bill is perfect, but we have a once-in-a-lifetime bill to deliver EXACTLY what @POTUS promised: lower taxes, a secure border, strong military, and reining in spending. And with only 51 votes!

It's simple: President Trump won HUGE in November. He helped us deliver a House and Senate GOP majority. It's our job to help him deliver the MAGA agenda.

As we speak, many of us are still working with the White House on improving this bill in the Senate. 

Keep in mind: this reconciliation process can ONLY be used for non-discretionary (aka mandatory) spending. Stick with me. All that means is because President Trump's MAGA bill only requires 51 votes vs 60, there are strict limits on what can be included.

The appropriations process is how we can aggressively cut more discretionary spending (already in the works). Plus, we've got the rescissions process (@WhiteHouse sends Congress a package of funding to cut) to make @DOGE cuts permanent.

It's a lot of government lingo, but we'll do our best to keep breaking it down. Bottom line: trust President Trump.

The Senate needs to pull the section in the OBBB that destroys federalism for 10 YEARS to allow AI to run rampant!!!

40 state Attorney Generals wrote a letter demanding the UNPRECEDENTED federal power grab be removed from the One Big Beautiful Bill!

40 State AGs!!!!

Notably missing is GAs AG Chris Carr. Fatal mistake for a Republican governor candidate by the way! 

AI is going to replace mass amounts of human jobs in nearly every job sector over the next 10 years, which will lead to massive unemployment and that leads to poverty!

And ultimately death because there will be no other jobs to find.  How do you keep a roof over your head and feed your family without a paycheck???  You can‚Äôt!!!!!

This will make the last 40 years of losing manufacturing jobs to foreign countries look like nothing as unemployment rates will reach levels never seen before in U.S. history.

States must have the right to be either wide open AI friendly, recruiting AI tech companies to their states or AI shut - defending human rights, jobs, and safety from an AI and robotic takeover or somewhere in between!!!

Americans must be allowed to choose which state they want to live in, in the future, as AI changes everything and the federal government has NO RIGHT to force every state to be compliant and the same!!!

Otherwise we are NOT FREE AT ALL!!! 

Brett Guthrie, Chair of E&C, apologized to me yesterday for not briefing us on this little section in the over thousand page bill, about what the AI lobby is pushing for in order to compete with China. 

By the way, if you want to compete with China then do it in our American framework that supports how our country was founded which is on federalism-supporting state rights and not big federal power.  Otherwise, America is NO DIFFERENT than China!!!

The One Big Beautiful Bill is supposed to be about delivering President Trump‚Äôs campaign promises on taxes, America First energy, and sweeping border security, NOT destroying state rights for the AI industry or the NY SALT caucus lining their rich Democrat states pockets or anyone else‚Äôs pet projects. 

Stop hijacking the bill!!!

By the way, ZERO Conservatives were warning about this before the bill was passed!!! Why not??? Either they didn‚Äôt know or they were fine with it!!!  But they can‚Äôt lie either way!

And if America wants to defeat China, stop sending our meat to be processed there.

Stop depending on China for our medications.

China has killed too many Americans by sending deadly fentanyl into the U.S. by the cartels. 

Make ALL of our food and critical chain supply in the USA and stop depending on China at all!!!

Didn‚Äôt you learn anything from Covid? And now two Chinese agents snuck another biological weapon into Michigan.

STOP dealing with China and PUT AMERICA FIRST!!!

I voted for President Trump‚Äôs One Big Beautiful Bill because it delivers his MAGA campaign promises and he endorses the bill and wants Congress to pass it in order to fund his MAGA agenda. 

Do I love the price tag?
NO. 
But I want OUR policies funded.

I campaigned across the country for YEARS with Trump, more than any member of Congress, and the man NEVER said he would destroy state rights for 10 years to let AI tech companies run rampant!!!

TAKE IT OUT OR I‚ÄôM VOTING NO WHEN IT COMES BACK TO THE HOUSE!!!!!

And lastly, our debt crisis is OUT OF CONTROL.  The interest is growing now at $1 trillion per year and getting bigger.

We can‚Äôt cut our spending enough and grow our economy big enough to dig our way out of this deep dark all consuming grave!!!

WE MUST CREATE THE AMERICAN SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND TO SAVE AMERICA!!!!! 

America has natural resources that are assets around $200+ TRILLION that should be placed on America‚Äôs balance sheet against our debt!!!

It will erase the debt and ultimately pay the American people!!!

"Weber, Randy K. Sr.",Representative,Texas,14,Republican,House: 2013-Present,Yes,TXRandy14,'1931021793529110691',"Eighty-one years ago, to this day, the young and most vital of our nation stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, to liberate the European Continent from authoritarian fascism. As these young men meticulously prepared for their invasion, they recognized the hardship and sacrifice that lay ahead. Nevertheless, the young men understood the importance of defending the traditions of individuality and freedom in the West; that is why, when confronted with insurmountable odds on the beaches of Omaha and Utah, these young men and their commanders refused to turn back, instead running forward into the breach carrying a beacon of hope and freedom to the world.¬†

We shall never forget what took place that day and the heroes who took part. We will continue to honor their courage and sacrifice against all odds. Particularly the bravery of young Texans from the 14th District, whose actions continue to serve as an example of perseverance and hope today. Here are two quotes from folks in Southeast Texas during D-Day.¬†

¬†‚ÄúAs the sky lightened, the armada became visible. The smoking and burning French shoreline also became more defined. At 0600, the huge guns of the Allied navies opened up with what must have been one of the greatest artillery barrages ever. The diesels on board our craft failed to muffle the tornadic blasting. I could see the TEXAS firing broadside into the coastline. Boom-ba-ba-boom-ba-ba-boom! Within minutes, giant swells from the recoil of those guns nearly swamped us and added to the seasickness and misery. But one could also actually see the two-thousand-pound missiles tumbling on their targets.‚Äù ‚Äì Sergeant Robert Bixler, 116th Infantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division.

‚ÄúThe ramp was lowered immediately after the rockets fired. It was our hope and desire to run right up on the beach for a dry landing, not because we were afraid of getting wet but because if we were soaked it would be added weight to carry while climbing. The British Navy man had promised to put us down dry, but suddenly we ran aground with the ramp dropped. The officer said, ‚ÄòEverybody out.‚Äô Looking ahead, I could see fifteen or twenty feet of water, a muddy dirty gray stretch. The Entire area was marked by craters, shell holes from the guns on the TEXAS and the bombers.‚Äù ‚Äì Lieutenant George Kerchner, 2nd Ranger Battalion.",en,Tweet,0,8,0,6,400.0,2025-06-06 17:14:06,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1931039518020550921',"Each week, we recognize members of our community who embody the very best of the American spirit‚Äîthose whose character and tireless devotion to others remind us of the values that have always made our nation great. Today, we honor a woman whose life is a testament to service, sacrifice, and unwavering love of country. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero: the incomparable Connie Whalen.
 
Connie has worn many titles‚ÄîU.S. Navy Counselor, Executive Director of the Guardians of Washington Crossing National Cemetery, @TMFoundation mentor, and community leader. But above all, she is a faithful steward of duty, honor, and country.
 
At just 17 years old, Connie answered the call to serve and enlisted in the United States Navy. Over the next 21 years, she built a distinguished military career as a Navy Counselor. Her record of excellence earned her the National Defense Service Medal, Navy & Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, three Naval Meritorious Service Medals, and an extraordinary 25 Gold Wreath Awards for outstanding recruiting contributions during three of our nation‚Äôs most pivotal military operations‚Äîthe Persian Gulf War, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.
 
But retirement didn‚Äôt mark the end of Connie‚Äôs service‚Äîit marked the beginning of a new mission, every bit as meaningful.
 
As Executive Director of the Guardians of the National Cemetery at Washington Crossing, Connie leads a devoted team of volunteers who carry out one of our nation‚Äôs most sacred responsibilities: honoring those who served. From organizing memorial ceremonies and greeting funeral processions to offering final salutes and ensuring every veteran is laid to rest with dignity‚Äîthey are present, steadfast, and reverent. In every kind of weather, they stand watch. And on the final Thursday of each month, they hold a solemn ceremony for veterans with no family present. Under Connie‚Äôs leadership, the Guardians carry out sacred acts of remembrance that ensure no veteran‚Äîand no family‚Äîis ever overlooked, unhonored, or forgotten. Every life is acknowledged, every sacrifice remembered, and every service met with the gratitude it deserves.
 
As a leader with the Travis Manion Foundation, Connie plays a central role in shaping the next generation through the ‚ÄúCharacter Does Matter‚Äù program. Across our community and region, she mentors students and instills in them the values that define true leadership‚Äîintegrity, courage, respect, service, and a deep love of country. She encourages them to honor our veterans, serve their communities, and live lives rooted in character and purpose. Whether organizing service projects, building tributes to those who served, or guiding young people to lead by example, Connie empowers our next generation to become citizens who give more than they take.
 
I‚Äôve had the distinct honor of working alongside Connie over the years, and I‚Äôve seen firsthand the heart and dedication she brings to everything she does. She gives of herself fully‚Äîto our veterans, our youth, and our community‚Äîasks for nothing in return, and delivers more than most could imagine.
 
Connie, thank you‚Äîfor your courage, mentorship, leadership, and love of this country. You are, in every sense, a true Hometown Hero.",en,Tweet,1,14,2,6,1489.0,2025-06-06 18:24:32,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GsxuNNLXAAAeDhK.jpg

Their mission: silence the German guns aimed at the Allied landings below. Pointe du Hoc was a strategic stronghold, perched between Utah and Omaha Beach, fortified with artillery and machine guns that could‚Äôve shredded the invasion before it even started.

So before the main force hit the beach, 225 Army Rangers set out. They were led by a Texan and Aggie‚ÄîLieutenant Colonel James Earl Rudder. Under heavy fire, they fired rocket-propelled grappling hooks and scaled the 100-foot cliff. When they reached the top, they found the guns had been moved. But the mission didn‚Äôt stop there.

The Rangers searched, found the artillery, destroyed it, and held the line against fierce German counterattacks. For two straight days, they fought outnumbered and isolated.

When the battle was over, only 90 Rangers remained.
Rudder had been wounded twice and refused to leave. For his actions, he received the Distinguished Service Cross‚Äîthe second-highest award for combat valor. In 2022, the surviving Rangers were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.

They didn‚Äôt climb that cliff for medals. They did it because it had to be done. They showed what courage, sacrifice, and American grit look like.

1. Strive to be a leader of character competence, and courage.

2. Lead from the front. Say ‚ÄúFollow me!‚Äù and then lead the way.

3. Stay in top physical shape ‚Äì physical stamina is the root of mental toughness.

4. Develop your team. If you know your people, are fair in setting realistic goals and expectations, and lead by example, you will develop teamwork.

5. Delegate responsibility to your subordinates and let them do their jobs. You can‚Äôt do a good job if you don‚Äôt have a chance to use your imagination or your creativity.

6. Anticipate problems and prepare to overcome obstacles. Don‚Äôt wait until you get to the top of the ridge and then make up your mind.

7. Remain humble. Don‚Äôt worry about who receives the credit. Never let power or authority go to your head.

8. Take a moment of self-reflection. Look at yourself in the mirror every night and ask yourself if you did your best.

9. True satisfaction comes from getting the job done. The key to a successful leader is to earn respect ‚Äì not because of rank or position, but because you are a leader of character.

10. Hang tough! Never, ever, give up.",en,Tweet,2,27,3,4,1496.0,2025-06-06 20:39:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

5) High-Speed Rail: The federal government is cutting off funding after the Department of Transportation audit, which we announced in February, found California woefully out of compliance.

6) Sanctuary State: My bill to end sanctuary policies has significant traction, and the combination of executive actions and federal law enforcement has mitigated the sanctuary policy.

7) Water Scarcity: We've secured major funding for the first new significant water storage in California in decades, and we're stopping the diversion of water to the ocean.

9) Failing Schools: The House just passed the most significant school choice legislation in history, which I sponsored. It is part of the reconciliation bill that will receive a vote in the Senate.

"Greene, Marjorie Taylor",Representative,Georgia,14,Republican,House: 2021-Present,Yes,RepMTG,'1932066259803197777',"Hi David, I think the AI discussion is one of the most important issues we can plan for.
For context of my background and conceptual framework. As a business owner in construction, I am pro business and understand the labor issues and needs better than most.
As a Representative in the U.S. House, I believe protecting federalism is essential, constitutional, and the American way.
Every innovative industry in our country‚Äôs history has had to rise under each states ability to regulate and make laws on behalf of their citizens. 
Tying our states hands behind their back for 10 years with a moratorium freezing states ability to regulate and make laws is the opposite of federalism and makes us no different than China with a big government power grab.
Allowing states to regulate and make laws will preserve the state‚Äôs abilities to choose their path.
Currently on the federal level, Congress has not developed a federal regulatory plan for AI yet. We would be preemptively destroying federalism for 10 years without a plan.
We know governors and states are ranked on job creation and economic stats.
By protecting federalism, some states will compete to be the most AI friendly and will make decisions to recruit AI tech companies with varieties of incentives.
Other states may choose to be less AI friendly and that‚Äôs their right.
My district is a filled with wonderful working class people. 
Many of whom will have their jobs replaced by AI and AI driven robotics. 
I‚Äôve watched Georgia‚Äôs rural communities devastated for the last 40 years after manufacturing jobs were sent overseas and once those plants shut down, other jobs were scarce.
This destroyed small towns, their economies, and consequently it destroyed families as well. 
How many human jobs will AI replace over the next 10 years? 
It‚Äôs predicted to replace a large swath of human jobs in many areas.
And once AI replaces all of those human jobs, they will not have hardly any jobs to find.
My district has an unemployment rate of 2.9% but after AI job replacement, we could see unemployment rates we‚Äôve never seen before.
This would lead to poverty and homelessness we‚Äôve never seen before.
And with a 10 year moratorium, states would have no way to regulate and make laws to protect people.
The people are who matter to me.
My children in their 20‚Äôs and their future children are who matter to me, and all of their generations.
Once many human jobs are replaced, who is paying these unemployed people?
How do they feed their families?
The economy will collapse.
And when they are no longer paying federal and state taxes because they can‚Äôt, how will that affect government funding?
The future is unknown and I believe in order to best lookout for people I‚Äôve sworn an oath to serve, I must defend federalism.
Besides this AI clause in the One Big Beautiful Bill doesn‚Äôt belong in the bill. That bill is supposed to be the president‚Äôs campaign promises, which are taxes, energy, and very much needed border security and deportations. 
Poison pills kill great bills.
Republicans must address AI separately with sincere diligent efforts instead of the typical tricks of shoving a 19 year federalism moratorium in a big thousand page bill. 
I want to see this done right to be good for all.",en,Tweet,32,795,152,200,161098.0,2025-06-09 14:24:27,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

"Lee, Mike",Senator,Utah,,Republican,Senate: 2011-Present,Yes,SenMikeLee,'1932084073175867541',"Are you tired of paying too much for medications?

I just introduced a bill to make your prescription drugs more affordable: The Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act.

‚ÄúBiosimilars‚Äù ‚Äì generic alternatives to name-brand medications ‚Äì have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of biologic drugs through increased competition.

Choosing biosimilars over their name-brand counterparts could save consumers an estimated $42.9 billion by 2027.

Americans deserve to hold this decision-making power, but red tape around biosimilars keeps them from being widely used. The FDA‚Äôs complex approval system has confused physicians, patients, and states about biosimilars‚Äô safety and efficacy.

Biosimilars must undergo extensive testing to prove they provide no meaningful difference from their name-brand version. Bringing a new biosimilar to market costs as much as $300 million and can take as long as 9 years.

Even after this approval, patients may not be able to access biosimilars because Congress created a separate designation: interchangeability. To be classified as truly ‚Äúinterchangeable‚Äù with the name-brand version, a biosimilar must undergo further testing called ‚Äúswitching studies.‚Äù This type of research has proven unnecessary for biosimilars, as it repeatedly shows no meaningful difference or relevant new data.

The Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act would remove these extra steps so that a biosimilar will immediately be classified as interchangeable upon its initial approval by the FDA. Foregoing unnecessary switching studies would no longer disqualify biosimilars as alternatives to their name-brand counterparts.

We need to give Americans the option to save billions on their medications and increase competition in the pharmaceutical market.

We should pass the Biosiliar Red Tape Elimination Act.

Statistics show a sharp uptick in hate crimes against Jewish folks in America since October 2023. Those include hate crime incidents in my own state of Vermont, the tragic murder of two Israeli embassy workers in Washington, D.C., and now an attack on a peaceful assembly for hostages held by Hamas in Colorado.

No one deserves to be discriminated against because of who they are. Antisemitism is wrong. Islamophobia is wrong. I've traveled to both Israel and Palestine. I've met with Israelis who want the conflict to end, who believe that Netanyahu's actions are harmful and won't make their country safer. I've met with Palestinians who denounce Hamas and mourn the loss of Israelis along with the tens of thousands of civilians killed in Gaza.

I‚Äòve been one of the most outspoken Senators against what I believe has been a harmful war strategy by Netanyahu. I was one of the first Senators to call for a ceasefire in the months following Hamas‚Äô horrendous attack on innocent people in Israel. I called for a ceasefire to prevent more loss of innocent life, free the remaining hostages, and to move toward a two-state solution.

I believe that Israel has a right to defend itself, but that Netanyahu has waged a reckless war campaign that disregards civilian life‚Äîincluding bombing aid workers and withholding humanitarian aid from reaching those who desperately need it.

Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu's actions doesn‚Äôt justify hate of our Jewish neighbors. Criticism of Hamas' actions doesn‚Äôt justify hate of our Palestinian neighbors.

I urge Americans to reject hate and respect each other. In Vermont, we have a deeply rooted value that regardless of differences, you give your neighbor a helping hand when they need it.

Army North plays a vital role supporting @DHSgov on the southern border with surveillance, logistics, engineering, and medical assistance. Relocating it risks undermining mission effectiveness at a time when 11,900 active-duty troops are deployed under Title 10 authority as part of Joint Task Force‚ÄìSouthern Border.

This decision would impact not just national security, but also our local economy. The military is San Antonio‚Äôs top employer, and the community has already invested $20M in new facilities to enhance its role as a hub for military medical missions. San Antonio also hosts the Sixteenth Air Force (Air Forces Cyber), a key component of our nation‚Äôs cyber defense. This move would disrupt military families who‚Äôve already relocated to support these critical missions.

San Antonio has the infrastructure, workforce, and strategic location to support our national defense. I‚Äôll continue fighting to keep these vital missions right here - close to the border they‚Äôre tasked with protecting.

I look forward to continuing these conversations to ensure our national security decisions strengthen, not weaken, border readiness and Texas communities.

What did you learn in your internship that has helped you through the rest of your college career? 
‚ÄúOne thing I learned throughout the summer internship is adaptability and the value of asking questions. Senator Rounds‚Äô office has many constituent services and legislative responsibilities that ensure all tasks are done efficiently and on time. Adapting to situations, asking clarifying questions, and critically listening to staff and constituents‚Äô requests has helped me become a better student by encouraging me to grow in the comfort that not knowing everything right away is okay. Asking questions helps you better understand what is required of you to complete any task to the best of your ability, which has helped me throughout my entire college experience.‚Äù

Is there a memory from your internship that still sticks out to you? 
‚ÄúAlthough I made many great memories, some that stick out to me include the times I spent at different Senate Committee Hearings on Capitol Hill. These opportunities deepened my understanding of how the legislative branch of the government functions and deepened my appreciation for the work that Senators, specifically Senator Rounds, do for South Dakotans. Outside of the internship, exploring the Washington D.C. area over the summer was also one of my favorite parts of the summer.‚Äù",en,Tweet,0,5,2,4,839.0,2025-06-10 20:04:22,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtGraWxXIAAXslh.jpg
