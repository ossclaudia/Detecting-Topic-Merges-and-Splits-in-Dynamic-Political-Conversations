From the fields of Chester County to the winner‚Äôs circle at the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, Smarty Jones captured the imagination of fans across the country. In 2004, he came within a single length of winning the Triple Crown, showing the world that champions can come from right here in our Commonwealth.

This year, Smarty Jones was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame, only the fourth Pennsylvania-bred horse to receive that distinction. Today, thanks to Rodney and Sharon Eckenrode, he continues to stand at Equistar Training and Breeding Center in Lebanon County, where his legacy carries on.

Smarty‚Äôs story is a reminder that when you‚Äôre Pennsylvania-bred, you‚Äôre built to run with the best.

This material is not classified and relates to what has now become a very large congressional investigation:

*In my opinion, there is definitely an intelligence connection. Countries named by the lead attorney for the witnesses included Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Israel, as well as a former CIA director (inferred to be the CIA director under the Bush administration, based on the attorney‚Äôs description of interactions while Epstein was in his work/arrest program).

*The 30,000+ files are in the process of being loaded into a more accessible and searchable format. These files include the Ghislaine Maxwell transcript and audio, full videos of Epstein‚Äôs cell (including the missing minute), as well as courthouse documents that had to be formally requested, as they were not easily accessible. There are also thousands of pages of records, including DOJ emails.

*The witnesses have stated they were unable to obtain their own files, and we are actively working to provide those to them. Again, previous admins denied them. But the Trump admin is assisting. Big difference. 

*The SARS report, which will eventually be made public, will include names.

*There is an active class action lawsuit involving the victims and the bank. Therefore, we must be careful to ensure this investigation is not used to influence the lawsuit, in accordance with ethical standards.

This is a very large and expansive investigation. To be clear, the end goal is not only to deliver justice for the victims but also, equally important, to make criminal referrals to the DOJ.

It is also important to understand how frightening this is for some of the women involved. In some cases, they were threatened. With that in mind, I will continue to provide updates on what we can share without jeopardizing the investigation. I also want to emphasize that both the victims and others have stated to the press that President Trump was not involved.

To imply otherwise, while knowing the facts, is to weaponize this investigation as a smear campaign. I do not agree with that in any respect and will not allow this process to be used for such a purpose.

Chairman Comer and Oversight members will continue to provide updates and information as this investigation moves forward.",en,Tweet,425,4775,1250,696,232588.0,2025-09-05 03:52:08,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Houston, who served in the War of 1812 and held political positions in Tennessee, played a crucial role in Texas' independence. He led a decisive victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, and was instrumental in Texas joining the United States in 1845. He served as a senator and governor, though he was later removed for opposing secession.

In a notable incident, Ohio Congressman William Stanbery accused Houston of fraud in a House speech. Two weeks later, Houston confronted Stanbery on Pennsylvania Avenue, calling him a ""rascal"" and attacking him with a hickory cane from his mentor‚Äôs, President Andrew Jackson‚Äôs, estate. Stanbery's attempt to defend himself with a pistol failed when it jammed. Houston's assault left Stanbery injured on the street.

Americans are taxed at gun point for Social Security with 6.2% being forcibly withheld from their paycheck and employers are taxed at gunpoint and forced to match each employees contribution at 6.2% and self employed individuals are taxed at gun point being forced to pay the entire 12.4% on earnings.

The government‚Äôs failures on Social Security is a separate debate, but Social Security is FOR AMERICANS and Americans deserve every penny.

Foreign countries do not deserve American‚Äôs hard earned tax dollars and anyone demanding they do should register under FARA.

This 2022 estimate of the government‚Äôs spending of $8 TRILLION American tax dollars on foreign wars since 9/11, doesn‚Äôt include the hundreds of billions for Ukraine, however that $8 TRILLION spent was America LAST and unnecessarily drove America‚Äôs national debt.

But attacking Ana Kasperian or anyone else with ‚ÄúJew hatred‚Äù for demanding that we stop funding Israel and every other foreign country, and foreign wars, is completely unacceptable and turning many Americans off.

It‚Äôs absurd really.

The reality is Americans have been chained in over $37 TRILLION in debt and Americans deserve their Social Security money they were FORCED to pay!

The nuclear armed secular government of Israel is such a successful country that they have less than $400 billion in national debt and provide government funded healthcare and education to their citizens. 

Daily, Israel is proving that on their own, they are more than capable of destroying their enemies with no one‚Äôs help, as they not only destroy their enemies, they also destroy innocent lives.

Saying stop giving Israel $3.8 billion dollars a year isn‚Äôt Jew hatred or antisemitism, it‚Äôs just as simple as saying America can‚Äôt afford it anymore and shouldn‚Äôt have to continue paying.

In June, I joined @RepFrenchHill (AR-02), @RepMikeLawler (NY-17), @RepJoshG (NJ-05), and @RepMoskowitz (FL-23) in introducing the bipartisan Countering Wrongful Detention Act of 2025, which establishes this very designation for countries or nonstate actors that hold American citizens or permanent residents hostage. This legislation equips both the Secretary of State and Congress with¬†new tools to hold these governments accountable by encouraging a range of penalties.
¬†
For my constituent, Sarah (Levinson) Moriarty, this issue hits especially close to home. Her father, Robert Levinson, was taken hostage by Iran in 2007. For years, her family lived in absolute uncertainty, wondering where he was, whether he was alive, or if they would ever see him again. Unfortunately, they never did. Far too many American families have endured that same fear, heartbreak, and loss. With this important legislation, paired with today‚Äôs executive order, we are making real strides to ensure that no family is ever forced to live through this tragedy again.
¬†
Hostile regimes like Iran continue to use innocent Americans as bargaining chips by dehumanizing, abusing, and in some cases killing them. This legislation would codify President Trump‚Äôs executive order and make clear that there will be consequences for using Americans as political pawns.

"Jackson, Jonathan L.",Representative,Illinois,1,Democratic,House: 2023-Present,Yes,rep_jackson,'1964455551007674468',"If #Churchill were faced with the threat posed to #Chicago by @POTUS he may have said:

More than half of a year has passed since this struggle entered its fiercest phase. What a cataract of calamity has descended upon us since then. The trust of the people in Washington and Los Angeles suppressed; their voices silenced beneath bluster; their free institutions mocked. Our allies in truth and democracy harried and betrayed. Entire communities of our nation, gutted and abandoned, their hopes of fraternity as brutally torn as any rampart in war.
Yet here in Chicago, we stand‚Äîundaunted, unbroken, resolute. 

If in January, one had told us that, after such disaster and shock, we should stand upright in September, masters of our own resolve, firm in the conviction of ultimate triumph, few would have credited it. Yet so it is. Where others faltered, Chicago has not wavered. We are stronger today‚Äîstronger in spirit, stronger in unity, stronger in the faith that justice shall prevail‚Äîthan ever we have been before.

The Trump faction believed that the air of confusion, the tempest of words, could cow us‚Äîthat by unbridled assault upon truth, they could drive us to submission. Yet the good men and women of Chicago have risen nobly, as never before. They have labored unceasingly, they have restored their strength, they have bristled their city against tyranny from within or from without. Chicago today is a fortress for Democrat, a beacon of hope, a sentinel of justice.

It is quite plain that Mr. Trump could not admit defeat in his assault upon the institutions of American democracy without sustaining the most serious injury. If, after all his vainglorious boastings, his dire threats, and the lurid accounts so loudly trumpeted across the nation of the triumphs he claims to have inflicted‚Äîof the vast numbers of crimes he alleges were committed, of the multitudes he insists have risen to his cause, and of the pitiful weakness of our civic order‚Äîif, after all these extravagant tales of Washington and Los Angeles laid low, their citizens panic-stricken and despairing of their government, if, after such a torrent of words, his whole offensive should, in the end, be forced to dwindle and fade into nothingness, the gentleman‚Äôs reputation for veracity, slender though it already is, would suffer the most grievous discredit. 

We may be sure, therefore, that he will persist as long as strength and circumstance allow, and as long as the manifold preoccupations of his legal entanglements with Epstein are in need of diversion from public purview and discourse.

On the other hand, the Patriotic spirit of free men and women has increased in vigour. Our capacity for endurance is already shown to exceed theirs. Each falsehood, once unmasked, becomes a weapon against him. Each scheme revealed serves not his cause, but ours.

And so I say this: The gratitude of every home in Chicago, of every family that lifts its head in freedom, of every heart across this nation that esteems liberty above servitude, goes forth to those few champions of truth and courage, who against overwhelming odds, in the heat of this mighty trial, turn the tide by their devotion.

Never, in the field of public struggle, was so much owed by so many to so few.",en,Tweet,0,2,2,3,548.0,2025-09-06 23:27:55,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>","#Churchill,#Chicago",,,

Peace through strength means standing with democracy‚Äîand against dictators who seek to burn it down.

Safe housing transcends party lines, which is why this bill earned bipartisan approval.
