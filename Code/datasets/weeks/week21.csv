Governor Tucker served as my predecessor in the U.S. House of Representatives from the Second Congressional District from 1977 to 1979.

"Roy, Chip",Representative,Texas,21,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepChipRoy,'1890236201463845246',"üö® REP. ROY STATEMENT ON BUDGET RESOLUTION üö®

‚ÄúToday I voted to report the Chairman‚Äôs FY25 Budget Resolution out of the Budget Committee. I did so with reservations due to the urgency of our current debt crisis and my concern that there is insufficient resolve in Congress to address that crisis, thus leaving Americans with the devastating tax of inflation and high interest rates.  Yet the bill would ‚Äî if adopted by Republicans on the House floor ‚Äî represent an historic level of spending reductions paired with extension and expansion of President Trump‚Äôs tax policies and would take a significant step down the path to fiscal sanity while simultaneously delivering on critical portions of President Trump's agenda.

It was not easy to reach this point. My Budget Committee colleagues ‚Äî along with support from the House Freedom Caucus ‚Äî had to push hard to achieve the spending cuts included in this resolution. We did what members of Congress are supposed to do: we deliberated, negotiated, and legislated. Chairman Jodey Arrington deserves particular compensation for standing strong and showing true leadership and resilience during this process.

What we achieved through those talks is a plan to do what the American people want it to do: cut wasteful spending and keep taxes low. Today's budget resolution will enable us to reach $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and potentially more than $2 trillion in spending cuts over ten years.

While I believe we should be able to do far better than a mere annual $200 Billion of reductions on over $7 trillion in total annual spending, the bill will supplement Elon Musk‚Äôs and DOGE's mission to eradicate government waste, and it lays the foundation to fully unleash the Trump economic agenda. Further, this plan takes away Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats' ability to hold the economy hostage by raising the debt ceiling coupled with reducing spending.

Most urgently, this sets us up to rush $300 billion in funding for border security, immigration enforcement and the military so those critical missions continue uninterrupted.

The American people expect us to deliver and we have a duty to do what we said. Today's resolution is an important part of doing so.  Onward.‚Äù",en,Tweet,37,1146,232,268,156539.0,2025-02-14 03:06:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Today, we recognize a man whose life is not just part of history but has helped define it. Meet this week‚Äôs Hometown Hero: World War II Veteran Chuck Kunes of Middletown, the last surviving member of the legendary Black Sheep Squadron, who turns 100 years young on February 27th.
 
In 1942, at only 18 years old and the world at war, Chuck bravely stepped forward and proudly answered the call to serve. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and became part of VMF-214, the Black Sheep Squadron‚Äîone of the most revered aviation units in military history. Under the fearless leadership of Major Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington, Chuck and his squadron took part in some of the fiercest air battles of the Pacific. As a flight mechanic, his role was vital‚Äîensuring that warplanes were combat-ready, that pilots could return to the skies, and that the fight for freedom would endure. The Black Sheep Squadron became legends, and Chuck stood among them‚Äîa young man whose quiet courage and unshakable resolve helped turn the tide of history.
 
When the war ended, Chuck returned home and became one of the original residents of the Stony Brook section of Levittown. Here, he helped shape one of the most special communities in our district‚Äîa community where veterans and families built their futures, bound together by the resilience and camaraderie of a generation that had sacrificed so much. For over 40 years, Chuck served as an executive at 3M in Bristol, leading with the same integrity, discipline, and steadfast commitment that had defined his service. His greatest achievement, however, is in the life he built. Alongside his beloved wife, Alma, they raised three wonderful children, instilling the same values of service, sacrifice, and love of community and country.
 
I had the profound honor of celebrating Chuck on his 96th birthday and paying tribute to his extraordinary service in Washington last April. Now, as he nears his 100th birthday, please join me in honoring a life that epitomizes duty, valor, and selfless service. Happy 100th Birthday, Chuck!

Let me be clear: this is yet another attempt by co-Presidents @elonmusk and @realDonaldTrump to slash essential services at the expense of the American people while making room for billionaire tax breaks.

These reckless decisions not only harm the federal workers who have dedicated their careers to protecting us and serving our communities in GA-04 and metro Atlanta, but it also endangers the American public during a time of increased health concerns and looming dangers.

If Putin plans to take over Europe, clearly he is not intimidated by NATO. I believe very strongly that Putin wants no part of a war with NATO because it would be the end of Putin‚Äôs Russia.  

My proposal to deter Putin is simple: Learn from the mistakes of 2014. 

1. Arm Ukraine by selling them American weapons over the next decade to prevent future Russian military incursions.

2. Pursue economic integration between Ukraine and the U.S. that would be financially beneficial to both countries and would create a new relationship to counter Russia. 

3. While there is a debate as to whether Ukraine should be in NATO now, let‚Äôs make it clear to Putin that if there is a third invasion, Ukraine would be automatically admitted into NATO.

For this alliance to be strong, Europe must match Russia‚Äôs military and defense spending, must stop funding Russia‚Äôs war machine by purchasing Russian oil and gas, and must follow UK PM Starmer‚Äôs lead by standing side-by-side with Ukrainians inside Ukraine - Literally.  Europe must take full accountability and responsibility for their own security, which requires them to take accountability for their budgetary and policy priority decisions.  We live in a very dangerous world, and every freedom-loving nation must take this reality seriously and not be foolishly naive to these threats.  World peace and freedom must be an equal and collective effort by all freedom-loving nations.

"Goldman, Daniel S.",Representative,New York,10,Democratic,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepDanGoldman,'1891653866606952787',"Tomorrow, the Senate will move the nomination of @kash_patel for FBI Director. While President Trump lets @elonmusk run wild grifting and slashing the federal government, Trump has been mainly focused on his revenge and retribution tour. Patel is *the* one he cares most about. Here‚Äôs why. 

First, let‚Äôs recap what Trump has done in four weeks to eliminate accountability in the executive branch:

1) fired 20 inspectors generals, including the independent Office of Special Counsel and the Director of the Office of Government Ethics.

2) purged FBI agents and prosecutors involved with the criminal cases against him.

3) installed his criminal defense lawyer to run DOJ who has already blatantly weaponized it. 

4) pulled security clearance and security protection for anyone who has challenged him.

5) pardoned ALL J6 criminals, including violent ones, effectively creating his own extremist militia.

In sum, Trump has cleared the decks for Patel to do what he repeatedly promised to do over the past few years: get revenge and retribution for his overlord. 

Second, let‚Äôs look at who Patel is:

1) brief tenure as mediocre national security lawyer for DOJ before a short stint on the House Intelligence Committee before joining Trump‚Äôs national security council where he was best known for funneling false information from Rudy Giuliani and others directly to Trump. 

2) worked outside ethics rules/chain of command on Russia investigation and Ukraine investigation.

3) paid FBI whistleblowers who testified in Congress. 

4) defended violent J6 criminals. 

5) wrote a children‚Äôs book about ‚ÄúKing Donald.‚Äù

6) published an enemies list.

7) declared that Trump declassified documents by ‚Äúthinking it,‚Äù which led to him requiring immunity from prosecution in order to testify before the Grand Jury. 

8) uniformly panned as corrupt and unqualified by Trump‚Äôs own officials (Barr, Bolton, Haspel). 

Since his nomination, this is what we‚Äôve learned:

1) he repeatedly lied under oath, in ways big and small (ie defined the word ‚Äúwe‚Äù to not include himself, said he did know extremist podcast host whose show he appeared on eight times, etc).

2) according to credible whistleblowers, he directed the purges of FBI officials, even though he testified under oath that he had nothing to do with it. 

3) Refused to provide his grand jury testimony (which only he can do) and DOJ blocked the release of Volume 2 of Special Counsel report in which he‚Äôs reportedly extensively involved.

4) concealed from the Senate shady foreign business deals with China.

AG Pam Bondi promised under oath that she would not use the DOJ for political purposes. She broke that promise in her first week. 

If confirmed by Senate Republicans, Kash Patel will destroy the FBI and make us less safe.",en,Tweet,82,1605,768,417,71628.0,2025-02-18 01:00:01,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

At the Battle of Sechault, Pippin was shot and later awarded the Purple Heart for his valor. After the war, he pursued his passion for art, creating pieces mixing his experiences as a soldier and a black man in segregated America. His works brought attention to the plight of African Americans and explored artistic avenues for resisting oppression during the civil rights movement. His pieces received national acclaim and have been displayed in the MoMa, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the National Gallery of Art.
