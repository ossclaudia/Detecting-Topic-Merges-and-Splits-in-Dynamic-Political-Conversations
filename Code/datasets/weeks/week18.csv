"Murkowski, Lisa",Senator,Alaska,,Republican,Senate: 2002-Present,Yes,lisamurkowski,'1882496900223377719',"Since Mr. Hegseth‚Äôs nomination last November, I have met with him and carefully reviewed his writings, various reports, and other pertinent materials. I closely followed his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee and gathered substantial feedback from organizations, veterans, and Alaskans. After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for Secretary of Defense. I did not make this decision lightly; I take my constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent with the utmost seriousness.

I commend Pete Hegseth‚Äôs service to our nation, including leading troops in combat and advocating for our veterans. However, these accomplishments do not alleviate my significant concerns regarding his nomination. Managing the Department of Defense requires vast experience and expertise as the department is one of the most complex and powerful organizations in the world, and Mr. Hegseth‚Äôs prior roles in his career do not demonstrate to me that he is prepared for such immense responsibility. His leadership of two veteran organizations was marked with accusations of financial mismanagement and problems with the workplace culture he fostered.

Although he has recently revised his statements on women in combat since being nominated, I remain concerned about the message that confirming Mr. Hegseth sends to women currently serving and those aspiring to join. Women have served our nation with distinction, overcoming immense obstacles to excel in combat and leadership roles, and they deserve to know that their leader honors and values their commitment to our nation.

While the allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking do nothing to quiet my concerns, the past behaviors Mr. Hegseth has admitted to, including infidelity on multiple occasions, demonstrate a lack of judgment that is unbecoming of someone who would lead our armed forces. These behaviors starkly contrast the values and discipline expected of servicemembers. Men and women in uniform are held accountable for such actions, and they deserve leaders who uphold these same standards.

Above all, I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense, and must be prioritized without compromise. The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth‚Äôs nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook. Given the global security environment we‚Äôre operating in, it is critical that we confirm a Secretary of Defense, however, I regret that I am unable to support Mr. Hegseth.",en,Tweet,1605,46549,6664,54724,11817625.0,2025-01-23 18:33:30,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

"Collins, Susan M.",Senator,Maine,,Republican,Senate: 1997-Present,Yes,SenatorCollins,'1882517564435140987',"After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against Pete Hegseth‚Äôs nomination for Secretary of Defense. While I appreciate his courageous military service and his ongoing commitment to our servicemembers and their families, I am concerned that he does not have the experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job.

Our military is under tremendous pressure right now. Active conflicts in the Middle East and Europe combined with escalating threats in the Pacific, all against a backdrop of severe financial challenges and four years of ineffective leadership by the Biden Administration, make this an especially critical time for those who lead our military. The next Secretary of Defense will be responsible for managing a massive bureaucracy that includes nearly three million employees and a budget of nearly $850 billion. In addition, our next Secretary faces long-standing procurement and supply issues that continued to worsen under the Biden Administration.

In sum, the Secretary is going to be facing a number of incredibly complex problems that are going to require highly skilled management ability. I am concerned that Mr. Hegseth does not have the management experience and background that he will need in order to tackle these difficulties. His limited managerial experience involved running two small non-profit organizations that had decidedly mixed results.

I am also concerned about multiple statements, including some in the months just before he was nominated, that Mr. Hegseth has made about women serving in the military. He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views. I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.

Women comprise nearly 18 percent of our active-duty military. They continue to make critical and valuable contributions to our national defense. I have long advocated that women who wish to serve in and can meet the rigorous standards of combat roles should be able to do so. And numerous women have proved that they can accomplish this difficult feat.

Currently, thousands of women are serving in combat roles and many others serve in non-combat functions.  Their service is essential to the success of our military.

Mr. Hegseth also appears to lack a sufficient appreciation for some of the policies that the military is required to follow because they are codified in the laws of the United States of America. While I understand his points on the importance of up-to-date and workable rules of engagement, our prohibitions against torture come from American laws and treaties ratified by the United States, including the Geneva Conventions.

Therefore, I will vote against the nomination.",en,Tweet,1344,52032,5455,49884,5994613.0,2025-01-23 19:55:37,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Sir Winston Churchill, the British leader who led Great Britain and the Allies through World War II l, was born in 1874 at Blenheim Palace. He began his career in the military, serving in India, Sudan, and South Africa before shifting to politics.

Though blamed for the failed Gallipoli campaign during WWI and briefly sidelined from politics, Churchill returned to the cabinet in 1917 and rejoined the Conservative party. Throughout the 1930s, he warned of the rising Nazi and Japanese threats, often ignored.

With the outbreak of World War II, Churchill became first lord of the admiralty again and later prime minister in 1940. His leadership was crucial in uniting Britain against the Axis powers, forging vital alliances with the US and USSR.

"Fitzpatrick, Brian K.",Representative,Pennsylvania,1,Republican,House: 2017-Present,Yes,RepBrianFitz,'1882846852816539655',"Each week, we shine a spotlight on individuals and organizations whose extraordinary contributions make a profound difference in the lives of others. This week, we celebrate a remarkable woman who has devoted her life to embracing differences, championing individuality, and harnessing the transformative healing power of horses to change lives. Meet this week's Hometown Hero‚ÄîJanice Witt, Executive Director of the Warrington-based non-profit @SpecialEquest.
 
Janice‚Äôs journey is one of purpose and perseverance‚Äîa testament to turning passion into progress and vision into reality. Her work is not just remarkable; it is life-changing. Since stepping into her role as Executive Director in 2022, Janice has not only steered Special Equestrians through challenging times but has redefined what is possible. With over a decade of experience in nonprofit therapeutic horseback riding and a lifelong connection to horses, Janice has taken the reins with courage and conviction, transforming lives one stride at a time.
 
With a bachelor‚Äôs in psychology from Ursinus College and master‚Äôs in occupational therapy from Temple University, Janice began her career in early intervention and school-based therapy. Yet her heart always led her back to horses, drawn to their unique ability to heal, teach, and empower. This passion, combined with her expertise, has elevated Special Equestrians into a beacon of hope and transformation for our community.

Under her leadership, Special Equestrians has become a sanctuary for people of all ages and abilities‚Äîa place where differences are not just accepted but celebrated, where challenges are met with compassion, and where potential is nurtured with every step.
 
When the pandemic forced the organization to close its doors, Special Equestrians faced an uncertain future. But Janice‚Äôs resilience turned adversity into opportunity. Through her steadfast leadership and unwavering commitment, the program not only reopened but emerged stronger than ever. Today, it serves over 100 riders weekly and touches hundreds more through innovative outreach programs that bring the healing power of horses to schools, nursing homes, and community centers.
 
Janice is also working to create innovative mental health programming. Her visionary Therapeutic Horsemanship program, tailored for individuals confronting mental health challenges such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression, goes far beyond traditional therapy. It fosters resilience, equips participants with critical coping skills, and strengthens emotional well-being through the quiet yet profound connection between humans and horses.

The true impact of Janice‚Äôs work is measured in the lives she has touched: the child with autism who discovers newfound confidence in the saddle, the veteran with PTSD who finds solace in the steady rhythm of a horse‚Äôs steps, and the senior who rediscovers joy through the gentle nuzzle of a horse. These are the moments that define Janice‚Äôs legacy.
 
For hundreds of individuals who walk through its doors, Special Equestrian's therapy offers life-changing transformation. Her influence extends beyond the riders, touching families, caregivers, and entire communities.

Moving forward, Janice is working to expand resources, eliminate waitlists, and break down barriers to ensure Special Equestrian's life-changing programs are available to everyone in need. In her words: ‚ÄúI want to say yes to everyone who wants to experience the healing power of horses.‚Äù
 
Please join me in applauding Janice and her entire team of staff, volunteers, and incredible horses for their unwavering dedication to improving the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of others. Thank you, Janice, for your extraordinary impact and for inspiring us all to make a difference in the lives of others.",en,Tweet,0,10,0,4,950.0,2025-01-24 17:44:05,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiE3OfkXIAA3EqS.jpg

‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs first week in office has set a dangerous course for our nation. From rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to pardoning January 6th insurrectionists and enacting divisive immigration policies, these actions undermine core American values and threaten our democracy. 

The elimination of diversity programs in federal agencies and the return to outdated hiring practices jeopardize decades of progress toward fairness and equal opportunity. Diversity is not a threat‚Äîit is a cornerstone of America‚Äôs strength and unity. 

The pardons granted to January 6th insurrectionists send a deeply troubling message about accountability and justice. Similarly, President Trump‚Äôs challenge to the Constitution regarding the citizenship of American-born children of immigrants undermines the principles of equality and inclusion that define our nation. These actions threaten millions of families and weaken the foundation of what made this country great. 

The administration‚Äôs environmental actions, including withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement and dismantling critical protections, prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of our planet and economy. These policies will harm working families and leave future generations to face the consequences. 

The American people deserve leaders who bring us together, uphold the rule of law, and work toward a future that benefits everyone.‚Äù",en,Tweet,0,17,2,6,1924.0,2025-01-26 02:39:20,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiL7VEDW0AA4Yj0.jpg

The Trump administration‚Äôs federal funding freeze threatens critical resources for Texas‚Äô 18th Congressional District, putting Houston families, students, small businesses, and veterans at risk. This reckless action jeopardizes funding for education, healthcare, disaster relief, and public safety‚Äîprograms that are essential to our community.

In Houston, this freeze could leave families struggling to feed their children and pay for housing. Programs like Head Start and Title I grants, which provide vital support to local schools, would face devastating disruptions. Universities across Houston, especially our historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), could lose critical funding for education and job training.

Small businesses, many still recovering from past disasters, would lose access to loans and grants, while public safety funding for law enforcement and firefighters could be halted. Disaster relief from FEMA and healthcare funding for community health centers, life-saving medical research, and mental health services like the 988 Suicide Lifeline would also be at risk.
