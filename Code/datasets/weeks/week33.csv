Because they’d rather honor a foreign country run by drug cartels than stand up for the American people.

The Gulf isn’t secured by Mexico. It’s defended by the United States Coast Guard and Navy. Every year, tens of thousands of pounds of deadly drugs including cocaine, fentanyl, meth, and heroin, are trafficked through the Gulf and smuggled into our communities.

Since January 20, 2025, the U.S. Coast Guard has seized over 100,000 pounds of cocaine and over 10,000 pounds of marijuana, much of it trafficked through these waters.

Democrat policies have fueled this crisis. They opened our borders, defunded border enforcement, and prioritized illegal aliens and MS-13 gang members over American families. These same Democrats are now outraged over the idea of renaming a body of water that we protect, we patrol, and we pay for.

Democrats and Republicans alike are rightly skewering Kathy Hochul and her budget for her sheer incompetence and catastrophic policies hurting New York. 

Governor Kathy Hochul’s disastrous $254 billion budget is not only the latest budget in over 15 years, but also it is a staggering $13 billion increase over last year’s already bloated budget and it is a double down of her failed policies that have bankrupted New York’s hardworking families. 

Under Kathy Hochul, New York already leads the nation in population loss due to unaffordability, sky-high taxes, and out-of-control crime. Hochul’s latest catastrophic budget will further exacerbate the mass exodus from our great Empire State. 

Even elected Democrats have publicly declared the budget process and outcome ""shameful"" and have shredded various aspects of Hochul’s budget.

Hochul puts New Yorkers last as she pours hard earned taxpayers funds into sanctuary city policies that incentivize illegal immigration all while diverting resources from our underfunded veterans’ services and law enforcement. 

Hochul once again perpetuates New York’s violent crime crisis by refusing to fully repeal disastrous bail reform laws, leaving our neighborhoods less safe and emboldening criminals. 

Her budget doubles down on insane gas stove bans and unaffordable energy regulations that will further crush families and small businesses already grappling with soaring utility bills. 

And in true NY Democrat corruption fashion, the cherry on top is Hochul’s secret taxpayer-funded slush fund for corrupt Tish James to use hard earned NYers money to defend herself in court for her illegal mortgage fraud. 

Truly Democrat corruption at its finest led by Kathy Hochul. 

And as always, Governor Hochul’s refusal to eliminate New York City’s congestion pricing toll—a punishing unaffordable tax opposed by a vast majority of New Yorkers—demonstrates her utter disregard for the financial burdens facing commuters, workers, and small businesses.

The process behind this budget, the latest in 15 years, reeks of cronyism and incompetence. New Yorkers deserve a transparent, fiscally responsible budget that prioritizes our needs, not the desperate attempt to shore up a politically weakened and toxic governor who is desperately trying to shore up her abysmal poll numbers.

As the highest-ranking Republican in New York, I resolutely oppose Hochul's unaffordable plan and will continue fighting to restore commonsense policies that put New Yorkers FIRST. 

Change is coming. And we must work together to SAVE NEW YORK from Hochul’s sheer incompetence and ineptitude.",en,Tweet,1,132,45,21,5945.0,2025-05-08 16:24:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

He is unfit to serve in public office. 

That’s why I put a hold on his nomination and made clear I would use every tool at my disposal to oppose his confirmation.

Ed Martin has opened political investigations where there was no evidence to warrant them. He has dismissed cases against his own clients and demonstrated the most profound conflicts of interest. 

He has fired, demoted and forced the resignation of dedicated professionals who refused to go forward with his unethical edicts and those of others in the department. Scrutiny of Martin’s past also exposed his embrace of avowed antisemites, his undisclosed appearances on Russian state media, and his support for violent January 6th insurrectionists.  

Ed Martin is unfit to practice law, let alone serve as a United States Attorney.

I will be watching closely to see whom the President nominates next to serve as the U.S. Attorney for D.C. And I will keep working to ensure that the January 6 deniers are not confirmed to positions from which they can undermine our rule of law and threaten our democracy.

Americans are struggling, and what are House Republicans doing? Voting to rename the Gulf of Mexico, a political stunt cooked up by Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Instead of addressing the issues that are keeping families up at night, Republicans are playing games to stroke Trump's fragile ego.

It’s irresponsible. It’s out of touch. It’s a waste of time. And it’s a complete distraction from the real work Congress should be doing to lower costs and deliver solutions that actually help American families.

We’ve negotiated in good faith on SALT from the start—fighting for the taxpayers we represent in New York.

Yet with no notice or agreement, the Speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee unilaterally proposed a flat $30,000 SALT cap—an amount they already knew would fall short of earning our support.

It’s not just insulting—it risks derailing President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

New Yorkers already send far more to Washington than we get back—unlike many so-called “low-tax” states that depend heavily on federal largesse.

A higher SALT cap isn’t a luxury. It’s a matter of fairness.

I fully support private property rights. But you can’t increase density by that much without first addressing roads and critical infrastructure. I’ve warned the commission about this for years — and they continue to ignore the reality on the ground. We simply don’t have the infrastructure to support this kind of growth.

For over a decade Dr. Hayden has been the guardian of our nation’s truth and intellectual legacy, but she was too fair-minded for Trump.

He wants to ban books and tell Americans what to read – or not read, and what history should be erased.

Earth calling Donald Trump... ""If you erase it, we will replace it.""

President Trump and his administration are taking long-overdue action to hold elite universities accountable and ensure they aren’t being bought and influenced by adversarial foreign regimes. It’s a critical step toward restoring transparency and integrity in higher education.

Today, we shine a spotlight on a young woman whose brilliance, resilience, and heart have made history. Meet this week’s Hometown Hero: @BensalemSchools senior, Victoria Mathieu.
 
At just 18 years old, Tori is blazing a trail—and putting our community on the map. Earlier this month, she became the first Bensalem student ever accepted into five Ivy League universities, part of an extraordinary 14 total college acceptances. Her video capturing the moment went viral—nearly 5 million views—and for good reason. It wasn’t just a celebration of success, but a symbol of what’s possible when hard work, courage, and conviction come together.
 
Beyond her exceptional GPA, Tori has built an academic and service record that speaks volumes. She’s a standout on Bensalem’s Mock Trial Team and founder of her school’s chapter of a global legal honors society. She interned with Legal Aid of Southeastern Pennsylvania, working to expand access to justice for families who too often fall through the cracks. As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Access to Legal Aid Caucus, I know how critical that work is—and the fact that Tori is already leading in this space before she’s even graduated high school is nothing short of extraordinary.
 
Her leadership extends well beyond the classroom. Tori serves as a student representative on the Bensalem School Board, giving her peers a voice in shaping their education. She founded and captains the high school’s Step Dance Team, leads the Reading Olympics Team, and serves as a Pennsylvania Global Ambassador for ReSoap—a youth-led nonprofit combating hygiene poverty and climate change. She’s a proud member of DECA, preparing for a future in business and innovation. And through Still I Shine, the virtual support group she founded, she’s created a space for students across our region to connect, support each other, and feel seen. Tori’s story is a testament to the power of opportunity—and what’s possible when talent is matched by character, conviction, and community values.
 
Her father, Pierre, came to the United States from Haiti at 18. Her mother, Tina, immigrated from Nigeria at 10. Together, they believed in the promise of this country—that through hard work and education, their children could build a better life. Their daughter is living proof of that promise in action. She’s not just walking through doors—she’s holding them open for others.
 
We are incredibly lucky to have a young woman like Victoria Mathieu representing our community. Tori, congratulations on all you’ve achieved—you have an entire community cheering you on! We’re proud. We’re inspired. And we can’t wait to see all that your future holds.",en,Tweet,1,13,0,3,1304.0,2025-05-09 17:07:47,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GqhQH63XIAEtgbY.jpg

None of these actions make our country safer or citizens more prosperous, but here are some of the things the Trump administration delivered this week:

President Trump threatened to end the program designed to expand high-speed internet access in communities it hasn't yet reached, calling it ""woke handouts based on race,"" despite funding already distributed to red, rural states including Alabama, Iowa, Kansas and Indiana.

One day after testifying in front of Congress to explain why FEMA should not be disbanded, acting administrator Cameron Hilton was summarily fired.

President Trump fired the Librarian of Congress. Carla Hayden was only the 14th person to serve the nation in this apolitical role, and she was also the first woman and first non-white person to do so.

A concept of a trade deal with the United Kingdom, with whom we enjoy a trade surplus, was announced yesterday that will lower the price of Rolls Royce, Bentley, Jaguar, Aston Martin, Range Rover and Mini automobiles. There were no carveouts for any other consumer goods.

The Trump administration is putting pressure on countries facing US tariffs to approve the use of Starlink in their territory, a satellite company owned by special government employee Elon Musk.

President Trump appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro to serve as interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia after being forced to withdraw the nomination of his first choice because the ""Stop the Steal"" activist and J6 defender could not muster the support of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

President Trump pulled down another nominee, this time for Surgeon General, because his first choice came under scrutiny for inflating her credentials. Yesterday he nominated a wellness influencer and author instead.

A vote to make sure the Gulf of Mexico appears as the Gulf of America on US government maps and documents was one of only six bills Speaker Johnson brought to the floor.

Most of the buyers of President Trump's meme coin, who are currently in a competition to win a dinner and/or a special tour with him, have used foreign exchanges that ban US buyers, making it likely that foreigner customers are not only directly enriching the president but also buying access to him.

Pete Hegseth was found to have conducted even more official Pentagon business over the unsecured Signal platform, and yet he is still the Secretary of Defense.

For their scout projects, Andrew designed and built a nature-inspired playground at Windmill Day Camp and School in Doylestown, giving back to the place where his own learning journey began. His project now provides a creative and safe space for future generations to grow and explore.

Stephen created two custom picture frame shelves for the Pennsburg Thrift Store, thoughtfully designed with fabric-lined slots to safely store and organize merchandise. His project improved the store’s functionality and helped support the local families and individuals who rely on it.

Maxwell led the landscaping design, fundraising, and installation of plantings for the FOP Lodge’s Fallen Officer Memorial—a thoughtful, enduring tribute that honors our heroes and brings new beauty and meaning to the space.

Brandon combined his love of history and nature by designing and installing a Historical Storybook Sign at Lenape Park in Perkasie. He researched the park’s landmarks, gathered stories, photographs, and created a visitor-friendly map.

Since 2016/2017, the Cuban regime has expanded its repression, imprisoned democracy activists (with many still in prison since the J11 protests of 2021), invited the PRC to establish an extensive spy hub 90 miles from U.S. shores, deepened its military training and weapons relationship with Belarus – all while thousands of Cuban nationals fight in Ukraine for Russia.

The so-called economic “reforms” constitute a handful of business licenses provided to the regime’s cronies; the new “laws” are decrees that will be ignored at whim. And how many of the released political prisoners are back in prison? The truth is that the Cuban people languish under a totalitarian dictatorship with a closed communist economy. The rest is propaganda. Continuing the PDCA, especially with its windfalls of assistance to the regime, enables the status quo at the expense of the Cuban people.

I commend Sweden’s principled leadership in asking for a formal review, my dear friends in Lithuania continuing to stand against ratification, and the courageous parliamentarians who spoke in favor of terminating the PDCA. History and the Cuban people will remember those who stood with them in the struggle for freedom.

Under the current system, the United States pays on average three times more for prescription drugs than other developed nations because other countries set price limits on prescription drugs, creating a situation where Americans pay more because pharmaceutical companies are trying to recoup the research and development costs for these medications.

President Trump’s executive order stipulates that American consumers will receive ‘Most-Favored-Nation’ treatment by telling pharmaceutical companies they cannot charge Americans more than they are charging people in other developed nations. This will result in reduced prescription drug prices and will shift the cost of research and development to other countries.

Xerina has been appointed to the United States Naval Academy Preparatory School, a powerful testament to her character, courage, and readiness to serve. Her path is one of leadership and purpose, and we couldn't be prouder.

Gabriel, winner of the 2025 Congressional Art Competition for the 28th District of Texas, reminds us that art is service too. His beautiful piece, “Texas Spirit,” will soon hang in the U.S. Capitol, telling the story of our heritage and heart through color and creativity.

I also had the pleasure of presenting Congressional Certificates of Recognition to other talented Nixon students who submitted artwork for the competition. 

A special thank you to Principal Cassandra Mendoza, Assistant Principals Rebecca Gonzalez and J.J. Solis, Councilman Rick Garza, Ms. Brooke Berrios for fostering student creativity, the families of Xerina and Gabriel for their unwavering support, and Captain Tom Clarity of the Naval Academy Preparatory School for sending words of encouragement.

To Xerina and Gabriel: your journeys may be different, one through service, one through art, but both are filled with promise, purpose, and passion.

Roughly 50 acres were treated, and the results are right in line with what’s needed: reduced hazardous fuels, improved soil health, and stronger wildlife habitat. Crews from the Plumas and Tahoe National Forests, CAL FIRE, BLM, and the Butte County Fire Safe Council all played a role. Their hard work on the ground helps ensure these burns are effective and safe.

This kind of proactive forest management is exactly what we need more of. Prescribed fire, when done right, at the right time of year, helps return forests to a more natural state and makes them more resilient to future wildfires.

More burns like this, more often, combined with thinning and bringing back industry—that’s how we get ahead of the wildfire crisis in the West.",en,Tweet,0,10,3,3,533.0,2025-05-13 21:00:00,"<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web Client</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gq2KS9bXgAE1mLU.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gq2KS9aWgAAiM1y.jpg"

"Crenshaw, Dan",Representative,Texas,2,Republican,House: 2019-Present,Yes,RepDanCrenshaw,'1922422776536687046',"The energy section of the Big Beautiful Bill includes user fees to expedite permits. Democrats say that’s “corruption.”

No—it’s efficiency.

It forces agencies to act, not stall.
It uses user fees, not taxpayer bailouts.
And it actually gets American energy projects approved.
No more endless delays. No more activist gridlock.
Because they don’t want faster permits — they want no permits.

This bill protects taxpayers and brings real efficiency back to the permitting process. It’s an effective way to achieve and maintain AMERICAN ENERGY DOMINANCE - and that’s why the Left hates it so much.
