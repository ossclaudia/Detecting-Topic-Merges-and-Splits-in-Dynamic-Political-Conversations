Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy and Republican Vice President Richard Nixon debated U.S. domestic issues in a Chicago studio. Kennedy recognized that the debates could significantly boost his campaign. The 43-year-old Massachusetts senator, who had risen from relative obscurity to become the Democratic nominee, faced challenges regarding his perceived inexperience as a leader. In preparation, he reviewed key facts and napped and tanned before the debate. He appeared well-rested and fit, a fact later acknowledged by Richard Nixon.

In contrast, Nixon was exhausted and unwell. The sitting Vice President had been campaigning vigorously across all 50 states and had recently spent time in the hospital due to a knee injury and subsequent infection. Arriving at the debate with a fever and in pain, he looked haggard, with debate producer Don Hewitt remarking that he appeared ""like death warmed over."" Despite his condition, Nixon chose to proceed with the debate, fearing that withdrawing would make him seem cowardly.

Interestingly, listeners on the radio believed Nixon won the presidential debate, while viewers who watched it thought Kennedy was the victor.

Although Nixon performed better in the second and third debates, Kennedy ultimately won the election, securing 49.7% of the popular vote against Nixon's 49.6%, making it one of the closest elections in U.S. history.

Nixon returned to presidential politics in 1968 but chose not to debate his opponent, similar to Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Televised debates resumed in 1976 and have been a staple of presidential campaigns ever since.",en,Tweet,0,28,9,5,2341.0,2024-09-26 12:57:35,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYZpJLzWwAEb9Lz.jpg

For every single day they strike it could take 6 days to catch up. Meaning just a 5 day strike could take a month to unload and load ships at ports up and down the East coasts and Gulf coasts!

The International Longshoremen's Association, representing 45,000 dockworkers from Maine to Texas at 14 different ports, contracts expire Sept 30th and they are demanding higher wages equal to other dockworker‚Äôs pay and guaranteed job security that they will not be replaced by automation and AI.

1977 was the last time they went on strike. That was long before America became dependent on foreign imports for food and necessary goods.

It‚Äôs very important to understand how critical this is given that America is now in a $36 billion dollar food trade deficit for the first time in our nation‚Äôs history. 

Also, the Biden-Harris administration and Congressional out of control spending has driven inflation so high that many Americans can‚Äôt afford quality of life.

I think this situation is serious and could be a crisis going into the election, holidays, and winter depending if they strike and how long it lasts.

As we celebrate his retirement, we honor his legacy of nearly four decades of service and leadership. Meet Chief Dean Logan, this week's Hometown Hero.

For 37 years, Chief Dean Logan has been a cornerstone of strength, compassion, and leadership, shaping the @DoylestownTwp Police Department and the very spirit of our community. From his first day on the job in 1987, Chief Logan embodied what it means to serve‚Äîalways ready to roll up his sleeves, face challenges head-on, and rise to the occasion whenever Doylestown needed him. His rise from patrol officer to detective and ultimately to Chief reflects his remarkable talents, unparalleled character and integrity, and commitment to excellence.

Over the past twelve years as Chief, his visionary leadership has transformed the Doylestown Police Department. He not only grew the department in size; he elevated its stature. By embracing cutting-edge technology, strengthening community relations, and leading the charge to secure accreditation with the Pennsylvania Law Enforcement Accreditation Program‚Äîan honor held by fewer than 10% of departments statewide‚ÄîChief Logan set a new standard of excellence. His tireless efforts have made Doylestown a safer, brighter, more resilient community. 

What makes Chief Logan exceptional is not just his professional accomplishments‚Äîbut his heart and ability to lead with kindness, strength, and respect, both within his department and throughout the community he proudly calls home. A Doylestown native and Central Bucks East graduate, Chief Logan returned home after attending Shippensburg University, driven by a deep desire to give back to the community that shaped him.

Barbara Lyons, the longtime Township Supervisor, said it best: ""Chief Logan did not just lead by example but built a department that reflects his values. The officers who serve under him do not just show up to hand out speeding tickets‚Äîthey are a part of the fabric of this community. That is Chief's legacy.""

Please join me in honoring Chief Logan for a lifetime of extraordinary leadership and service‚Äîa true Hometown Hero who gave his all to make our community safer, stronger, and more united. While he will be missed, we celebrate this well-earned milestone and extend our heartfelt congratulations as he embarks on a well-deserved retirement. Chief Logan‚Äôs impact on Doylestown is immeasurable, and his legacy will inspire future generations of leaders.

"Collins, Mike",Representative,Georgia,10,Republican,House: 2023-Present,Yes,RepMikeCollins,'1839991062057693354',"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1964, the Warren Commission, tasked with investigating the assassination of President Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, releases a report, concluding that Oswald acted as a ""lone gunman.‚Äù

President Kennedy was shot and killed while traveling in an open-top limousine during a motorcade in Dallas in 1963.

Less than an hour after the shooting, Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine employed at the Texas School Book Depository, shot a police officer who questioned him. He was arrested in a movie theater shortly after. Oswald was charged with the murders of Kennedy and Officer J.D. Tippit.

The following day, as Oswald was being transferred from the Dallas police headquarters, Jack Ruby shot him with a concealed revolver in front of police and reporters. Ruby, a nightclub owner with ties to organized crime, claimed he acted out of anger over Kennedy‚Äôs assassination.

As Oswald was killed shortly after assassinating Kennedy, his motive remained unclear. In response, President Johnson established the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. Led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the commission included U.S. senators, representatives, a former CIA director, and a former World Bank president.

Over nearly a year, the commission examined reports from the FBI, Secret Service, and others, reviewed Oswald‚Äôs background, and interviewed hundreds of witnesses while visiting the assassination site in Dallas. 

The commission released an 888-page report concluding that Oswald fired three shots from a sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository, killing Kennedy and injuring Governor Connally. While the report detailed Oswald‚Äôs life and connections, it did not explore his motives. It also criticized the Secret Service for inadequate security during Kennedy‚Äôs Dallas visit and stated that Jack Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald.

This finding did not satisfy many witnesses and researchers who found inconsistencies in the report. Various conspiracy theories emerged, implicating entities like the Cuban and Soviet governments, organized crime, the FBI, CIA, and even Vice President Johnson. Critics pointed to ballistics evidence and a home movie that seemed to challenge the claim that three bullets from Oswald caused Kennedy's fatal wounds and Connally's injuries.

In the late 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) conducted a new investigation. Their report supported the Warren Commission's finding that Oswald fired two bullets but also suggested a high probability of a second gunman and an unspecified conspiracy behind the assassination. Both reports remain subjects of debate.

The extensive documentation from the Warren Commission is housed in the National Archives, with much available to the public; however, access to Kennedy‚Äôs autopsy records is highly restricted, requiring special permission or affiliation with a presidential or congressional commission.",en,Tweet,1,24,8,11,3889.0,2024-09-28 12:30:29,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYj2HluXgAAN2DK.jpg

I commend the effort to eliminate Nasrallah, who has the blood of countless innocent civilians on his hands, and the United States should stand with our allies in the face of terrorist threats.¬†

For years, Nasrallah and Hezbollah, an Iranian terrorist proxy, have sought to sow divide in Lebanon and the Middle East, disrupting ongoing efforts for peace in the region. In the years since the Beirut port blast, Hezbollah has obstructed the democratic process in Lebanon, prevented the formation of a government and election of an independent president, and blocked humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people. Hezbollah's proxy bidding for Tehran has decimated the Lebanese economy, propped up corruption, and prevented the people of Lebanon from exercising their right to sovereignty, stability, and democracy.¬†

Like many Lebanese Americans, both in my district and across the country, I share concern for the people of Lebanon and pray for their continued safety. The death and destruction in Lebanon falls squarely on the shoulders of Nasrallah, Hezbollah, and their backers in Iran. Hezbollah's influence in Lebanon must be extinguished to allow for a prosperous future of the Lebanese people. The United States¬†must continue to support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to keep stability in the country and efforts to quickly open Parliament and allow the Lebanese to elect an independent president that will support the needs of the Lebanese people.¬†

After initial investigations of the deaths of the victims, doctors determined cyanide contamination, leading Johnson & Johnson to issue a historic recall of 31 million bottles. The cyanide had not originated in the company's facilities; rather, someone had likely tampered with the bottles after purchasing them.

Police used bullhorns throughout the streets of Chicago to urge residents to dispose of any Tylenol in their homes. Public health officials distributed flyers, and stores removed all Tylenol products from their shelves.

James Lewis, who claimed to be the Tylenol killer, sent a letter to Johnson & Johnson demanding $1 million to stop the poisonings. However, after an extensive investigation, authorities found no connection between him and the Chicago incidents. He was charged with extortion and sentenced to 20 years in prison but was released in 1995 after serving 13 years.

In response to the crisis, Tylenol introduced tamper-evident seals and solid pills, making contamination more difficult. The ‚ÄúTylenol bill‚Äù passed in 1983 made tampering with consumer products a federal offense. Johnson & Johnson's handling of the situation is considered a model for crisis management, and their stock rebounded within two months of the scare.",en,Tweet,6,27,5,7,3737.0,2024-09-30 13:01:34,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYuQaXJWkAA77SA.jpg

"Jackson, Jonathan L.",Representative,Illinois,1,Democratic,House: 2023-Present,Yes,rep_jackson,'1840763120085549205',"Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson calls for the Censure of Rep. Clay Higgins after Racist remarks against Haitians

Louisiana and Haiti have a shared history. Today, we should be celebrating and reflecting upon the rich and intertwined heritage of these connected cultures. These two regions, though separated by the Gulf of Mexico, share a bond that has profoundly shaped their cultures, economies, and identities.

In 1791, enslaved Africans in Haiti rose against their oppressors, leading to the first successful slave rebellion in history. This revolution culminated in Haiti becoming the first independent Black republic in 1804.
The impact of this Revolution extended far beyond the island‚Äôs shores. France, weakened by the loss of its most profitable colony sold the vast Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803. This acquisition doubled the size of America and opened up the continent for westward expansion. There would be no America as we know it, without Haiti.

The connections between Haiti and Louisiana are deeply cultural. Following the Revolution, many refugees, including free people of color, planters, and enslaved individuals, fled to Louisiana, particularly New Orleans. They brought with them their customs, cuisine, music, and religious practices, which have since become integral to the cultural fabric of Louisiana. The word ‚ÄúGumbo‚Äù itself comes from the West African word ‚Äúki ngombo,‚Äù which translates to okra.

The influence of Haitian culture is evident in the vibrant Creole cuisine, the rhythms of jazz, and the spiritual practices of Voodoo. The architecture of the French Quarter bears the mark of this shared heritage and Creole languages reflect their common roots in French colonialism and African heritage.

This shared history is what makes the words of Louisiana Congressman Clay Higgins all the more disgusting, abhorrent, and despicable. Congressman Higgins posted on his official account:

""LOL, These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters... but damned if they don‚Äôt feel all sophisticated now, filing charges against our President and VP, All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th‚Äù

These comments represent a new low even for Extreme MAGA Republicans. Higgins, a former policeman and sheriff's deputy in St. Landry Parish was disciplined by his commanding officer in Opelousas after he struck a handcuffed Black man and then lied about it amid an internal probe. He has bragged about voting for and supporting Klansman David Duke. In 2020, when protesters marched to bring justice for Breonna Taylor he used his official House account to post:

‚ÄúIf this shows up, we‚Äôll consider the armed presence a real threat,‚Äù ""I'd drop any 10 of you where you stand,"" ""Nothing personal. We just eliminate the threat. We don't care what color you are. We don't care if you're left or right. if you show up like this, if We recognize a threat...you won't walk away.""

What‚Äôs worse, is not the sentiments of Mr. Higgins but the response from his fellow Republicans. As Martin Luther King, Jr. once said ‚ÄúHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.‚Äù Mr. Higgins holds deep-seated fears and hatred of people who do not look like him. But the silence of Republican leadership has been so much more deafening and hurtful.

I call on Speaker of the House Johnson and the leaders of the Republican Party to join us in condemning Congressman Higgins; additionally, I join my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus in calling for the censure of the Member. His statements violate the House Rules regarding the conduct of a member and put the lives of millions of Haitians, other immigrants, and people of color in danger.

Speaker Johnson has said that Mr. Higgins has prayed on the issues and has atoned for his statement saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he probably regrets some of the language he used. But you know, we move forward. We believe in redemption around here.‚Äù However, Mr. Higgins has shown no such remorse saying:

¬∑ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all true!‚Äù
¬∑ ‚ÄúI can put up another controversial post tomorrow if you want me to. I mean, we do have freedom of speech. I‚Äôll say what I want.‚Äù
¬∑ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big deal to me. It‚Äôs like something stuck to the bottom of my boot. Just scrape it off and move on with my life.‚Äù

Mr. Higgins and his Project 2025, Extreme MAGA Republican allies are intent on doubling down and tripling down of hateful rhetoric and division. For this reason, the House of Representatives must act with one voice and vote to censure Representative Higgins.

Born on June 25, 1966, in Kinshasa, #Zaire, Mutombo was one of ten children. His father, an educator, ensured that his children had access to good schools. Dikembe‚Äôs early dreams were of becoming a doctor, and he eventually mastered nine languages, including French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and five Central African dialects.

His journey from #Kinshasa to the NBA is a testament to his determination and resilience.  Mutombo was a four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and an eight-time All-Star. His iconic finger wag and relentless defense made him a household name, but it was his humanitarian efforts that truly defined his legacy.

He dedicated his life to improving health and education in his native Democratic Republic of #Congo. Through the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation, he built the Biamba Marie Mutombo Hospital, providing critical healthcare services to thousands. His initiatives included free cervical and breast cancer screenings, knee and cataract surgeries.

As a UNICEF global ambassador and a tireless advocate, Dikembe‚Äôs impact was felt worldwide. His work with the NBA Cares program and various international relief agencies showcased his unwavering commitment to making the world a better place.

Renowned for its natural wonders like Half Dome and giant sequoias, this achievement was largely driven by environmental advocate John Muir and others, with support from President Benjamin Harrison. 

The park's creation followed a history of Native American habitation disrupted by the 1849 gold rush, which led to ecological damage and increased tourism. President Abraham Lincoln designated Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove as a public trust to protect them from exploitation, laying the groundwork for future national parks.

Muir and fellow advocate Robert Underwood Johnson pushed for national park status to protect the meadows around Yosemite from overgrazing by sheep. Their efforts resulted in the designation of over 1,500 square miles as Yosemite National Park, the third national park in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction eventually extended to Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. Ansel Adams later captured the park's beauty through iconic black-and-white photographs. 

Today, Yosemite attracts over 3 million visitors each year, who come to explore its breathtaking features, including Yosemite Falls, Half Dome, El Capitan, and the giant sequoia groves.",en,Tweet,2,32,6,6,5479.0,2024-10-01 12:37:50,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#ThisDayInHistory,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYzUkknWkAUASvm.jpg

Why is this administration sending ‚Äúhumanitarian aid‚Äù that ends up benefiting Hamas and Hezbollah, while also easing sanctions that give billions to Iran? All the while, they undermine Israel‚Äôs strategy and response.

None of this happened under Trump. He refused to appease Iran‚Äôs terrorist allies like Biden/Harris are doing.

If you don‚Äôt want WW3, we need President Trump back in the White House.
