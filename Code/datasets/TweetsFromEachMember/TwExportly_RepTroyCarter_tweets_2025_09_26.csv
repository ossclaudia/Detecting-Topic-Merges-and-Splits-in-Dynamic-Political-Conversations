The bald eagle, our national symbol, stands as a reminder of the strength, resilience, and freedom that define America. To see them so close, in their natural power and grace, was a moment of awe and deep reflection.

Nature has a way of humbling us — reminding us of God’s creation, the endurance of our nation, and the importance of protecting both.

Yet their presence is also a solemn call: as your Member of Congress, I will fight with every fiber of my being to safeguard our hard-fought gains and defend the freedoms and rule of law that make America strong.

America’s spirit still soars — and so will I, alongside you.

Heartless to seniors.
Heartless to children.
Heartless to the millions of Americans who depend on Medicaid to survive.

It’s a special rule used to pass bills that deal with money, like government spending, faster and with fewer votes in the Senate (to avoid a filibuster). So why are Republicans using it now? To pass a budget that cuts fundamental programs everyday people rely on, like health care and food assistance, while giving more tax breaks to billionaires.

Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian political system that prioritizes absolute power, nationalism, and control over individual freedoms. It often suppresses opposition, controls the media, and uses fear and division to maintain power.

Throughout history, fascist leaders have risen by attacking democracy, silencing dissent, and stripping away rights—all under the guise of “protecting the nation.” It is a dangerous ideology that threatens freedom, justice, and equality.

'1900507882765824279',"Cloture is a rule in the U.S. Senate used to end a debate and force a vote on a bill or nomination.

Think of it like this: If senators keep talking about an issue to delay or block a decision (this is called a filibuster), cloture is the way to stop them. It takes 60 votes to pass cloture and move forward. Once cloture is approved, debate is limited, and the Senate must take a final vote.

In short, cloture prevents endless talking and makes sure decisions get made.

Ever wonder why Congress is always scrambling to keep the government open? 

A continuing resolution (CR) is a temporary fix when Congress fails to pass a full budget. Instead of making responsible long-term decisions, Washington too often kicks the can down the road. Families and businesses can’t operate this way—why should Congress? 

It’s time for real, responsible budgeting.

    3.    Freeze of Federal Funds – Efforts to withhold or freeze federal funding to certain jurisdictions or programs have been challenged in courts and opposed by Congress, preventing broad implementation.

    4.    Changes to Medicare and Medicaid – Trump and Republican leaders have proposed cuts and structural changes to these programs, but Democrats have strongly opposed such measures, preserving current benefits and expanding access in some cases.

'1886139785124655424',"Please reflect on this famous poem, “First They Came” by Pastor Martin Niemöller. He was a German Lutheran pastor who initially supported Hitler but later opposed the Nazi regime and was imprisoned in concentration camps.

Here is the most well-known version of the poem:

**“First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.”**

The message is clear: when injustice is ignored because it doesn’t personally affect someone, it will eventually grow until it does.
