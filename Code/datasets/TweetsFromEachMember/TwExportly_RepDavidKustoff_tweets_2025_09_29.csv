My legislation, H.R. 2380, the Cellphone Jamming Reform Act, would deploy jamming technology to restrict cellular connectivity inside of prisons. Disabling cellular devices will help prisons crack down on contraband cellphone use and improve public safety.

One year ago today, barbaric Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and murdered over 1200 innocent men, women, and children, including over 40 Americans, and took over 250 hostages. That morning, the world changed forever.

On October 7, 2023, people were slaughtered, burned alive, raped, and kidnapped.

Terrorism does not distinguish between religions, nationalities, or ethnicities. It targets humanity. 
  
The United States and Israel are unified in our effort to strengthen regional stability, counter terrorism, and increase security. In recent years, the partnership between our two nations has only grown stronger.  
  
The House-Knesset Parliamentary Friendship Group will continue to work together to combat terror organizations that have called for the elimination of the State of Israel, and further wish to end democracy and destabilize the free world.
