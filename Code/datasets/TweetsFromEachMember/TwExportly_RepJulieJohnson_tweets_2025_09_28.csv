Moreover, Trump’s inability to secure a new Iran nuclear deal, and his decision to blow up the original deal in 2018, has directly contributed to the current crisis. That collapse not only eliminated diplomatic options to ensure Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, but also set the stage for this outbreak of military force.
