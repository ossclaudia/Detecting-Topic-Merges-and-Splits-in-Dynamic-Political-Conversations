'1944850930597249204',"It is hard to take @LancasterOnline seriously when they’re more interested in amplifying protest theatrics than covering the real work we do for Lancaster and York County families every day. Their recent article about how my staff meets with constituents on a weekly basis is bizarre—they meet with my office staff every week, but they say they can’t get in touch with me? The implicit bias of LNP is clear in their print and digital headlines.
 
Their latest article lays out the exact reason why I do not do in-person town halls. Organizations like Indivisible have a playbook for intentionally disrupting public events. As I have said for years, I am interested in having productive conversations. I do that routinely meeting constituents one-on-one, in small groups, through telephone town halls, visits across the community, and more. Having a productive conversation is impossible when there are individuals who intend to disrupt the event. Public discourse is done a disservice with these antics.
 
And leave it to Opinion Editor Suzanne Cassidy and the other avowed progressive liberals of the Editorial Board to ignore how the One Big Beautiful Bill finds over ONE TRILLION DOLLARS in SAVINGS—the greatest amount achieved in our nation’s history for a reconciliation bill. We achieve those savings by rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse of programs like Medicaid and SNAP, preserving the programs for those truly in need. The bill also advances the priorities that the American people care about—low taxes, border security, unleashing American energy, and providing for a strong national defense.
