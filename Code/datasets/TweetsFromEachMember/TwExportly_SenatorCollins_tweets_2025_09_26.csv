Senator Jeanne Shaheen and I — the founding co-chairs of the bipartisan Senate Diabetes Caucus — introduced legislation this week to reauthorize the Special Diabetes Program, a federal initiative that provides $160 million annually for Type 1 diabetes research and prevention. Thanks to this program and the tireless advocacy of @BreakthroughT1D and its Children’s Congress Delegates, we are seeing life changing breakthroughs in the fight against this terrible disease. Some of these developments include the now widely used continuous glucose monitors, the first FDA-approved artificial pancreas, and a groundbreaking clinical trial in which 10 of the 12 participants no longer need insulin to manage their diabetes because of a stem cell-based therapy. Since the founding of the Senate Diabetes Caucus in 1997, federal funding for diabetes research has increased from $319 million to more than $2.3 billion annually.

Since the despicable attacks on October 7, 2023, Iran has continued to use proxies and empowered terrorist groups to attack American servicemembers and our ally Israel. This week, Iran threatened to attack Americans on our own soil and around the world.

I supported the President’s targeted strike on Iran’s pursuit of nuclear capabilities because a nuclear-armed Iran would pose an unacceptable threat to America and our allies. I also applaud the current ceasefire. Given this backdrop, it is the wrong time to consider this resolution and to risk inadvertently sending a message to Iran that the President cannot swiftly defend Americans at home and abroad.

There has always been a Constitutional tension between Article I vesting in Congress the power to declare war and Article II designating the President as Commander-in-Chief.

Growing up in Aroostook County and having worked my first job on a potato farm, I know how much our farmers rely on these funds to plan for the season. When the timeline for receiving funding is uncertain, farmers lack the necessary clarity to make planting decisions and equipment purchases.

Delays can lead to low harvest yields, lost income, a diminished food supply, and more family farms shutting down. Maine has already lost 600 farms in the past decade.

'1918368146743771221',"Today’s announcement from the University of Maine that it has received full funding for Maine Sea Grant is terrific news for the fishermen, lobstermen, hospitality workers, and so many others in Maine that rely on a productive and growing coastal economy.

After a February announcement from the Department of Commerce that the program was being defunded, I contacted Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and the Trump administration to explain all that is at stake for Maine’s coastal communities with the loss of Sea Grant funding. After several productive conversations, Secretary Lutnick directed NOAA to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the work to be performed by Maine Sea Grant to ensure that it focuses on advancing Maine’s coastal economies, working waterfronts, and sustainable fisheries, and, this week, they received their funding.

I am thrilled that Maine Sea Grant has received its full funding so that the important work they do to conduct research, support a robust pipeline of skilled labor, and enrich our state’s economy can continue unimpeded. Maine Sea Grant has more than 700 established partnerships with businesses, researchers, community organizations, and local and county governments, and their work contributed to $23.5 million in documented economic benefits in 2023 alone. For every $1 of funding for Maine Sea Grant, our state has seen a $15 return—this is a valuable investment into Maine’s bright future.

'1918070241026031660',"It was deeply moving today to welcome Abigail Mor Edan to the Capitol for Members of Congress to meet this incredibly brave young girl. 
 
On October 7th, 2023, Hamas terrorists forced their way into Abigail’s family home in Israel. Her parents, Roy and Smadar, were shot and killed while attempting to shield the then 3-year-old Abigail from Hamas, while her older siblings Michael and Amalia hid silently in a closet for 14 hours before being rescued. Abigail was taken hostage by the terrorists, who held her in captivity for 51 days. Abigail’s 4th birthday occurred as she was still being held hostage.
 
I learned of Abigail’s story from her aunt, Liz Hirsh Naftali, soon after the October 7th attacks. Liz gave me Abigail’s picture and asked me to share her story. On a Senate delegation trip to Israel, I held up that picture during an international news conference to show the world that Hamas had taken innocent hostages, like this 3-year-old girl who had just witnessed the murder of both her parents. Abigail’s photo accompanied me at events throughout her captivity as a reminder of the families torn apart by the attacks and the urgent need to bring all the hostages home.
 
Today’s event was an occasion to celebrate the unbelievable strength and resilience of this now 5-year-old girl whose life has already been marked by unimaginable tragedy, and yet who continues to inspire with her ceaseless courage and spirit.

'1882517564435140987',"After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against Pete Hegseth’s nomination for Secretary of Defense. While I appreciate his courageous military service and his ongoing commitment to our servicemembers and their families, I am concerned that he does not have the experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job.

Our military is under tremendous pressure right now. Active conflicts in the Middle East and Europe combined with escalating threats in the Pacific, all against a backdrop of severe financial challenges and four years of ineffective leadership by the Biden Administration, make this an especially critical time for those who lead our military. The next Secretary of Defense will be responsible for managing a massive bureaucracy that includes nearly three million employees and a budget of nearly $850 billion. In addition, our next Secretary faces long-standing procurement and supply issues that continued to worsen under the Biden Administration.

In sum, the Secretary is going to be facing a number of incredibly complex problems that are going to require highly skilled management ability. I am concerned that Mr. Hegseth does not have the management experience and background that he will need in order to tackle these difficulties. His limited managerial experience involved running two small non-profit organizations that had decidedly mixed results.

I am also concerned about multiple statements, including some in the months just before he was nominated, that Mr. Hegseth has made about women serving in the military. He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views. I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.

Women comprise nearly 18 percent of our active-duty military. They continue to make critical and valuable contributions to our national defense. I have long advocated that women who wish to serve in and can meet the rigorous standards of combat roles should be able to do so. And numerous women have proved that they can accomplish this difficult feat.

Currently, thousands of women are serving in combat roles and many others serve in non-combat functions.  Their service is essential to the success of our military.

Mr. Hegseth also appears to lack a sufficient appreciation for some of the policies that the military is required to follow because they are codified in the laws of the United States of America. While I understand his points on the importance of up-to-date and workable rules of engagement, our prohibitions against torture come from American laws and treaties ratified by the United States, including the Geneva Conventions.
