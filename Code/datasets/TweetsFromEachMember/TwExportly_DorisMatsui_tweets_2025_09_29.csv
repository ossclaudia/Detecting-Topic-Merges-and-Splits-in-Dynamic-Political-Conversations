'1970614539453649384',"Nexstar pulled Jimmy Kimmel off its stations just days after FCC Chair Carr threatened broadcasters – all while Nexstar’s multi-billion-dollar merger awaits FCC approval. Now they say they will continue to keep him off the air.

The sequence is unmistakable – government pressure, then suddenly a show critical of Trump disappears from local TV. When Donald Trump can weaponize the FCC to strong arm broadcasters and dictate what Americans see and hear, our democracy is under direct attack.

That’s why I’ve demanded an inspector general investigation and why Congress must pass my Broadcast Freedom and Independence Act to end Trump’s censorship campaign and protect the First Amendment rights of every American.

But the Trump Administration doesn’t see it that way. They’ve twisted the Constitution into a one-way street that only protects them. That’s why President Trump, after years of threats, weaponized the FCC to pressure Disney into pulling Jimmy Kimmel off the air.

After immense public outcry, Disney eventually reversed course—proof that the voices of Americans under the protection of the First Amendment are stronger than this administration’s disregard for the Constitution. But, this abuse of power can’t happen again.
