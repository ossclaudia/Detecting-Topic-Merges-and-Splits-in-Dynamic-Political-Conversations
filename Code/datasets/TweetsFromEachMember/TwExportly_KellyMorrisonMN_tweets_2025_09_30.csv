Latest case in point: Idaho has lost **more than one third** of its OB-GYNs since it banned almost all abortions in August 2022. That is a huge loss for the nearly one million women who need access to reproductive, maternal, or basic primary health care in the state.

Both studies and experience have repeatedly shown the same thing:

You can’t ban parts of women’s health care without dangerous consequences.

Melissa was a remarkable person. She was a gifted legislator, a tough negotiator, a coalition builder, a strong and compassionate leader, and a mentor to so many, including me. She was relentless in her efforts to make Minnesota a better place for everyone, and I think she will be remembered as the most consequential Speaker of the House in Minnesota history. 

It was incredibly meaningful to see so many people show up to pay their respects and to grieve together. This is an immense loss and we will need to support each other as we walk through this. 

As Melissa and Mark’s children said in their beautiful statement: 

“Hope and resilience are the enemy of fear. Our parents lived their lives with immense dedication to their fellow humans. This tragedy must become a moment for us to come together. Hold your loved ones a little closer. Love your neighbors. Treat each other with kindness and respect. The best way to honor our parents’ memory is to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.”",en,Tweet,0,24,3,5,1252,2025-06-19 22:21:08,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gt1hB0wWsAAZxdI.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gt1hB0zW4AAs16v.jpg"

Instead, he’s focused on executive orders that raise the cost of living (see: tariffs) and make life harder for everyday Americans, many of which are now tied up in court for overstepping his authority and violating people’s rights.

It’s no surprise his approval rating is historically low. People are already tired of the chaos, the confusion, and the damage. They don’t want more power handed to billionaires while working families keep paying the price.

Bob is fighting back to protect Medicaid. Here’s how you can too:

1. Call your member of Congress and demand they protect Medicaid.

2. Share your story. Whether it’s your own, a friend’s, or a loved one’s experience with Medicaid, your story has the power to make a real impact. Share it on social media, with your community, and directly with your elected officials.

3. Join local organizations that support the causes you believe in -- like protecting access to health care and nursing home care.
