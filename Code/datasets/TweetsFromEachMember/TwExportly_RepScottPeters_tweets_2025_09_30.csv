'1864751497004875822',"Over the Thanksgiving break, I heard a lot of concern about the proposed 23-story tower in Pacific Beach. The developer found a parcel technically not covered by the coastal height limit and aggregated a number of density incentives from state law to add up to a very tall project.

I support building more housing in our existing neighborhoods. I’m a founding member of San Diego YIMBY (Yes in My Backyard) Democrats and the bipartisan YIMBY Caucus in Congress. Homelessness is high where rents are high, and rents are high where supply fails to meet demand. The cost of housing is the biggest impediment to the prosperity of the Golden State, and unless we lower costs, our teachers, police, firefighters, and our children won’t be able to live here. To lower costs, we need more homes.

Part of the solution is to build more housing on underused properties in our existing neighborhoods, including coastal neighborhoods like Pacific Beach. New housing can improve neighborhoods and make them more vibrant, walkable, and safe. It’s what I did as a City Councilmember when we added 138 units on La Jolla Boulevard as part of the redesign. The Seahaus project replaced a dilapidated motel with an attractive housing project now inhabited by customers of local businesses, children in local schools, and engaged neighbors. The developer also funded the construction of two of the five roundabouts. It wasn’t easy – some neighbors even filed a petition for my recall from office. But in the end, we got more housing and a better neighborhood.

That’s not what we will get from the Pacific Beach proposal. Other home builders I’ve spoken to worry that it will taint the reputation of all development and be a poster child for those who resist all new housing. I hope the Turquoise Street developer will reconsider the proposal and offer something in better keeping with the scale of the neighborhood. I also understand that this project will likely exceed the surrounding height limit. We can accommodate taller buildings on the major streets that can still fit in. A four or six or maybe even an eight-story building on that property could provide a good number of units, still enhance the neighborhood, and provide a path for future developments of the sort. But this project, in its 23-story form, is a mistake.",en,Tweet,7,21,7,22,6278,2024-12-05 19:19:36,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1864084303472120088',"I’ve listened and thought a lot about the Hunter Biden pardon. It was the wrong thing to do.

I sympathize with a father who rightly believes his son has been targeted by a politically motivated prosecution.  And many prosecutors – most are elected – have political motives. But prosecutors don’t adjudicate guilt – juries do, beyond a reasonable doubt, according to the law, and subject to appeal.  Hunter Biden made his mistakes, and he should have faced his consequences, with all the many protections our system provides.

We elected Joe Biden to put the country and the rule of law ahead of himself and his family.  When we rightly criticize Trump for pardoning Stone, Bannon, Flynn, Kushner, and his Jan 6 rioters, Republicans will now just reply that Biden pardoned Hunter. This is how the fragile norms that support our nation of laws change. The shoes are on both feet.

But listen up, Senators: If you don’t like presidential policies that put family and political cronies over country, you have the power to uphold the standard of law Americans have a right to expect. You may feel that Biden politized the justice system. Trump has explicitly said he will use that system to attack his political enemies.
