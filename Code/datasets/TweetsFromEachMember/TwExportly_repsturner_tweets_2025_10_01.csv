For example, the price of groceries like avocados and maple syrup will go up. Building a home or buying a car will become more expensive. Even gas prices could rise because these tariffs disrupt supply chains. Families trying to get by will feel the squeeze, and for what? These tariffs do not protect American workers; they punish American consumers. What happened to helping the American people? These tariffs do the opposite. 

They make it harder for families to put food on the table, keep a roof over their heads, and afford basic transportation. This Trump Tax is not what voters expected or deserved.

'1884387114151706709',"Statement from Congressman Sylvester Turner on the Federal Funding Freeze

The Trump administration’s federal funding freeze threatens critical resources for Texas’ 18th Congressional District, putting Houston families, students, small businesses, and veterans at risk. This reckless action jeopardizes funding for education, healthcare, disaster relief, and public safety—programs that are essential to our community.

In Houston, this freeze could leave families struggling to feed their children and pay for housing. Programs like Head Start and Title I grants, which provide vital support to local schools, would face devastating disruptions. Universities across Houston, especially our historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), could lose critical funding for education and job training.

Small businesses, many still recovering from past disasters, would lose access to loans and grants, while public safety funding for law enforcement and firefighters could be halted. Disaster relief from FEMA and healthcare funding for community health centers, life-saving medical research, and mental health services like the 988 Suicide Lifeline would also be at risk.

This unconstitutional freeze undermines Congress’ authority and creates unnecessary chaos for Houstonians who depend on these resources.",en,Tweet,1,13,5,3,1843,2025-01-28 23:44:32,"<a href=""https://buffer.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Buffer</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiawF9kWwAAYOq-.jpg

'1883343938049982770',"My Statement on President Trump’s First Week in Office:

“President Trump’s first week in office has set a dangerous course for our nation. From rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to pardoning January 6th insurrectionists and enacting divisive immigration policies, these actions undermine core American values and threaten our democracy. 

The elimination of diversity programs in federal agencies and the return to outdated hiring practices jeopardize decades of progress toward fairness and equal opportunity. Diversity is not a threat—it is a cornerstone of America’s strength and unity. 

The pardons granted to January 6th insurrectionists send a deeply troubling message about accountability and justice. Similarly, President Trump’s challenge to the Constitution regarding the citizenship of American-born children of immigrants undermines the principles of equality and inclusion that define our nation. These actions threaten millions of families and weaken the foundation of what made this country great. 

The administration’s environmental actions, including withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement and dismantling critical protections, prioritize short-term profits over the long-term health of our planet and economy. These policies will harm working families and leave future generations to face the consequences. 

The American people deserve leaders who bring us together, uphold the rule of law, and work toward a future that benefits everyone.”",en,Tweet,0,17,2,6,1924,2025-01-26 02:39:20,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiL7VEDW0AA4Yj0.jpg
