It’s not just personal connections that are strong here, but economic connections. Trade with Canada, visitors, and customers are a crucial part of the local economy in Northwest Washington.

Yet, every week Trump seems to find a new way to drive a wedge between us and our Canadian allies, and a new way to drive business away from our communities. He’s whipping up a fact-free frenzy about drugs at the Canadian border. The fact is: less than 1 percent of fentanyl intercepted at the U.S. border is from Canada. He has created complete chaos and fear for every day travelers crossing our border. People coming here for work, or just for visits, have been detained. His border theatrics are scaring away tourists and scaring off business.

And the pointless, painful trade war is in reality an enormous tax paid by our families.

Trump is pushing away some of our most important trade partners, raising prices for families at the grocery store, and pushing small businesses to the brink—some may even shutter. All of this is incredibly harmful to our communities—it’s not the way we should treat our neighbors, and it’s catastrophic for business too.
