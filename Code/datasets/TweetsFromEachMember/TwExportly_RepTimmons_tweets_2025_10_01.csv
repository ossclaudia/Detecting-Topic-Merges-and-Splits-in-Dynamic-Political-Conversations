These are basically subpoenas that require public disclosure and could have adversely impacted the value of any company that received the subpoena because of the inherent allegations that impropriety exists. 

It’s absurd to allege that new evidence was uncovered in the final hours of Director Chopra’s term warranting dozens or hundreds of new investigations.

It is our understanding from the JCCIC that all Members of Congress will be invited to the indoor ceremony.

'1873839228477726911',"The American people made their wishes loud and clear on November 5, giving President Donald Trump a decisive victory and another term in office to turn our country around. Meanwhile, Republicans in the House retained the majority with a narrow margin. Our takeaway is clear: the mandate from the American people lies with President @realDonaldTrump, and his America First agenda is what the American people want.

Individual House Republicans do not get to use our slim majority as a political tool to hold President Trump’s agenda hostage. President Trump only has four years to get us back on track. That means on Day 1 we must all be prepared to work to enact Trump’s agenda, not to critique, slow walk it, or even block it from happening. That is what the Democrats will try to do at every turn. The defectors in Congress should not be Republicans who think they know better than the candidate who just won the popular vote and every single swing state, carrying many Rs to victory with him. 

Today President Trump offered his complete and total endorsement for Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House. I will proudly stand alongside President Trump and support @SpeakerJohnson. President Trump has a plan, and he needs us in Congress to work together to make that plan a reality. 

Lastly, I will say this. One cannot be America First and then defy the America First President. Members of Congress thinking they know better than President Trump will be the reason we do not deliver for the American people. We have one opportunity to save this country, but we have to work together to do that.

They are working as quickly and as safely as possible to get power back to folks in the Upstate, and I am grateful for their hard work.

I want to thank the linemen and crews working around the clock to help get power back to as many people in the Upstate as quickly and as safely as possible. Crews are here from several other states and even Canada to help get power back. 

You may still be seeing downed poles in your neighborhood. The damage done to our electric system is extensive; it will take some time to get everything back up and running. In the meantime, if you have immediate needs, please contact your county emergency manager. 

Thanks to @blueridgecoop for allowing me to tag along with a crew working diligently to restore power to northern Greenville County. Their crews are working hard to rebuild after this catastrophic hurricane unlike we have seen here before. 

I know there are many folks in Greenville and Spartanburg without power — rest assured that hardworking people are working over time to get it back.

The effects of Helene have been catastrophic in our part of the state, and it is very clear it will take some time for us to recover. 

South Carolina is strong and resilient. We will weather this storm together. 

Please continue to monitor road conditions and stay home if possible. Many roads are still closed, traffic lights are out, and even gas stations are currently without fuel.

'1838996010615628042',"Have you recently applied for a mortgage and been bombarded by calls and texts from lenders?  Let’s talk about trigger leads.

When you apply for a mortgage, credit bureaus are notified that you are interested in financing, which is referred to as a trigger lead. That information is then sold by the credit bureaus to data brokers (including other lenders) without your knowledge or approval. That’s when other companies start working the phones to try to lure you away from your preferred lender. And you are left with dozens of calls and texts every day for weeks.

Trigger leads are a nuisance and an invasion of data privacy. Congress can do something about it. That’s why I am cosponsoring @RepJohnRose's legislation, the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act to prohibit trigger leads unless you opt-in.",en,Tweet,6,55,14,19,5423,2024-09-25 18:36:30,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
