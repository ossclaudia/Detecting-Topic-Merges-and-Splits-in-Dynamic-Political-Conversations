'1928509605169987852',"The Trump Administration hailed DOGE as the solution to eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, with Elon Musk promising to slash $2 trillion in government spending.

Now, Elon is walking away claiming he cut $150 billion – just 7.5% of what he promised – with no proof to back it up. Meanwhile, he burned through $135 billion in taxpayer dollars doing it.

If anyone’s a fraud, it’s Elon Musk. And if we’re talking about abuse of power, Musk is the poster child – making false claims, wasting billions, and walking away with zero accountability.

If the Trump Administration really wants to stop fraud, they need to start by addressing their own failures first.

Oh, and by the way: Musk continues to pocket money from government contracts that total $8 million a day.

'1928140893355200589',"The Trump Administration’s decision to revoke humanitarian protections for a four-year-old girl in Bakersfield is heartbreaking and unconscionable.
 
Two years ago, Sofia legally came to the U.S. so she could receive critical, around-the-clock care for a rare and life-threatening condition. Thanks to treatment at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, she’s been able to survive. But now, her family is facing deportation and putting her life in immediate danger.
 
Revoking Sofia’s legal status in the U.S. and denying her access to medical care is a cruel and inhumane act that violates our most basic values.
 
I’m calling on the Trump Administration to reverse its decision and allow Sofia and her family to stay in the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. Her life depends on it.

'1915798240458403977',"I recently visited the Goebel Adult Community Center in Thousand Oaks, a place where seniors come together to enrich their daily lives through a wide range of programs and services. From social activities to health support, Goebel plays a vital role in keeping our seniors active, engaged, and connected to their community.

But right now, these essential programs are under attack. Republicans are pushing reckless budget cuts to Medicaid and Social Security — two lifelines millions of seniors rely on for their health, well-being, and security. And as if that wasn’t enough, the Trump administration is working to dismantle the Administration for Community Living, which helps protect seniors from abuse, ensures they can access the benefits they’ve earned, and supports crucial services like adult day care centers and programs for seniors facing food insecurity.

During my visit, I spoke with seniors whose lives would be directly impacted by these cuts. The center’s adult day health services are a lifeline for many, and their stories made one thing clear: these programs are absolutely essential to the quality of life for our seniors.

No child should go to bed hungry. That is why I will keep fighting for federal funding and resources that support Food Share’s mission and ensuring our communities don’t go without.

Instead, this budget is a blatant scheme designed by House Republicans to line the pockets of wealthy donors, support big corporations, and appease the authoritarian whims of President Trump and Elon Musk – an unelected, unvetted, and unaccountable billionaire.

In their fervor to be in good graces with Trump and Musk, House Republicans are punting an immense burden onto hard-working families. Their proposed budget gives trillions in tax cuts to the wealthiest people and corporations in our country, and it makes devastating cuts to programs that provide critical support to everyday Americans. This proposal forces even more middle-class families to live paycheck to paycheck, especially hurting those who rely on Medicaid, nutritional assistance programs, and veterans benefits.

House Republicans have proven that they are willing to throw their own constituents under the bus for political gain and capital with Donald Trump. House Democrats will not stay silent in the face of this appalling disregard for the lives and livelihoods of American families. We will not give in to any compromise that puts politics over people.

Despite being confronted with irrefutable evidence of RFK Jr.’s anti-vaccine activism, his complete lack of knowledge of Medicare and Medicaid, and self-contradicting and anti-science policy agenda, an overwhelming majority of Republican Senators decided to put their loyalty to President Trump over their duty to protect the interests of the American people.

Elon Musk – an unelected, unvetted, and unaccountable extremist – has now gained access to the U.S. Treasury's data and payment system.

The Department of the Treasury is responsible for processing payments across the entire federal government, a process overseen by experienced and trusted civil servants. These individuals are specifically trained to safeguard the sensitive personal information of millions of Americans.

Now, Musk and his allies – without any oversight – have access to our personal data. This is a blatant invasion of privacy and a shocking abuse of power.

While the funding freeze has been rescinded, this administration has made it will stop at nothing to reduce funding for essential programs, putting millions at risk.

Clinicas provides vital care to our most vulnerable populations, and its mission relies heavily on stable federal support. Cuts to Medicaid and other essential services could force local health providers to scale back their operations or even turn away patients, further jeopardizing access to health care for those who need it most.

In #VenturaCounty alone, over 265,000 residents depend on Medi-Cal to access necessary healthcare. In California alone, over 14 million people rely on this program. Medi-Cal is not just health insurance– it’s a lifeline for children, working families, seniors, and people with disabilities.

Economists, business leaders, and a crashing stock market have made it clear: these tariffs are an economic disaster waiting to happen, and the American people will pay the price.

Despite the warnings from leading economists and industry leaders, Trump continues to demonstrate a fundamental lack of understanding of both the economy and how tariffs harm American workers, businesses, and families.

It’s not just an attack on the bravery and patriotism of transgender individuals who proudly serve – it’s an outright insult to the countless transgender servicemembers who have risked their lives defending our country.

What’s even more appalling is the hypocrisy behind it. Trump, whose ""patriotism"" encompasses pardoning 1,500 insurrectionists including violent offenders who assaulted police officers on January 6th, dares to question the patriotism of those who have served honorably in the military. Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, whose service has been clouded by allegations of excessive drinking, abuse, and assault, is spearheading this extreme anti-LGBTQ agenda.

In the absence of Roe, 22 statewide abortion bans are now in place. It is unconscionable that pregnant women are bleeding out in parking lots, while doctors face the threat of jail time for providing lifesaving reproductive healthcare.

Today and every day, I reaffirm my commitment to fighting for reproductive freedom, reproductive justice, and the right to abortion across the United States.

We must work together to safeguard our democracy, and I am willing to work with anyone – including President Trump and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle – to move our country forward and deliver for all of America’s working families, older Americans, our servicemembers, our veterans, and our children.

I commend President Biden and Vice President Harris for their steadfast leadership, grace, and commitment to ensuring a peaceful transition of power, which is a cornerstone of our democracy. Their administration has worked tirelessly to build a more inclusive and representative nation, and we must continue to build on their progress to restore trust in our democracy, expand opportunity, and improve the lives of all Americans.

To that end, I am committed to working with those who share the goals of lowering costs for everyday Americans, protecting our communities, and advancing the common good. While I will always seek common ground, I will stand firm against the rise of far-right extremism that threatens the safety and well-being of the American people.

Most Americans can find common ground because there is more that unites us than divides us. I strongly believe that more people have faith in the good of our country, and it is our ability to harness this hope and work toward the common good that will strengthen our nation.

Our country is great because of our democracy – and our diversity. Every person in this nation deserves the opportunity to realize their dreams and have access to the chance to succeed, regardless of background or circumstance. Everyone should be able to realize their full potential. Fighting for freedom, justice, and equality is at the heart of our nation’s founding ideals, and we must ensure that these ideals are reflected in the lives of all Americans. Immigrants should not live in fear, members of the LGBTQ community must be able to live their lives free from hate, and women’s rights and freedoms must be protected. We must also fight for our children and their futures, ensuring they have the opportunities to thrive.
