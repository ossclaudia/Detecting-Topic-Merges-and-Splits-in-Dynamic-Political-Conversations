'1856335707800850657',"America tragically loses 17 or more veterans to suicide each day. Losing one is unacceptable. Many receive good treatment at our VA, but sadly, not all respond to what therapies are now offered. 

We must enable our veterans suffering from TBIs and PTSD to receive therapy that could change their lives. As a surgeon, I have used hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for years on patients who need help healing their wounds. 

With the preponderance of evidence now showing it can help those with PTSD and TBI’s, we must offer it to our veterans.
