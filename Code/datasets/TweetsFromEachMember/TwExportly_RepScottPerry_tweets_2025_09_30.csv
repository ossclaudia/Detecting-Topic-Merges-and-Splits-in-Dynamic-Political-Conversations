Maybe because she had just gotten off work and was simply on her way home when she literally was slaughtered like an animal by Decarlos Brown Jr.?  Maybe because the mainstream media covered NONE of this until very recently when it started hitting social media – as if her life didn’t matter enough to report it? Maybe because the mayor of Charlotte, NC had the breathtaking audacity to marginalize this horror as simply a ""tragic situation…caused by a…lack of  social safety nets."" 

Or…all of the above. 

No, Madam Mayor - this “situation” is caused by the abject apathy, negligence, and malfeasance perpetrated by “leaders“ who refuse to uphold the standards of the law and deal with criminals. This individual had been arrested over a dozen times, and diagnosed with schizophrenia. WHY was someone with his record of violence and mental illness free to roam freely and perpetuate more violence?

Reprehensibly, the individuals who murdered him were never brought to justice due to inaction by state and local officials and the ""Enmons Loophole,"" in which the Supreme Court butchered the federal Hobbs Anti-Extortion Act to legalize violence and extortion by union members.
