'1969133220684763501',"Today I sent a letter with @SenRickScott to U.S. allies France, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia urging them to reverse course at the United Nations General Assembly by rejecting unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, which would empower Hamas, endanger Israel’s security, and eliminate a path to a negotiated peace.

Unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state undermines the principles of direct negotiation and imperils Israel’s security. This absurd action would reward the behavior of Hamas terrorists and does nothing to secure the release of the 48 hostages still held by Hamas.

'1962957079708369066',"Today, I sent a letter to the @SecretaryLCD calling for a federal investigation into actions by Governor Hochul and Commissioner Martuscello that potentially violated The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA).

In retaliation for the strike earlier this year by employees of the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), Governor Hochul and her administration violated the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). Specifically, the state directed employees on FMLA leave to be classified as absent without leave (AWOL), resulting in their termination.

In a copy of an email obtained by my office, the DOCCS Deputy Commissioner for Administrative Services instructed prison superintendents that ""staff who are calling in FMLA should be ordered in just like everyone else. If they refuse the order to report for duty, they should be made AWOL."" These actions resulted in the wrongful termination of DOCCS employees, in violation of federal regulations.

By classifying DOCCS employees on FMLA as AWOL, Governor Hochul and the DOCCS Commissioner caused families to lose access to health insurance, accrued overtime pay, sick leave, and unemployment benefits. As the COs challenge their loss of employment through the grievance process or appeal the denial of their unemployment benefits, they are being slow-rolled through the process with no communication from the New York State Office of Employee Relations or the Department of Labor. This is a clear-cut, coordinated abuse of power by Governor Hochul and Commissioner Martuscello, specifically their actions to deny employment and earned benefits to Correctional Officers and DOCCS employees.

This is just the latest in a long line of abuses of power and blatant attacks on law enforcement by Governor Hochul and her administration. I request that you review the illegal actions taken by New York State and compel compliance with FMLA for those employees who were terminated while on approved leave.

'1962953907543671204',"Today, I sent a letter to Governor Kathy Hochul demanding answers on her “No Call” List targeting fired correctional officers.

I was made aware that there exists within the Department a “NO CALL LIST” of approximately 200 individuals whom Hochul and Commissioner Martuscello have determined are not to be offered employment. This list, circulated to Superintendents across the state, is an attempt to block dedicated COs from returning to work.

I am requesting answers to the following questions:

1) What are the criteria Hochul and the Commissioner used to determine the composition of this list of individuals who are not to be rehired?

2) Are the individuals on that list being targeted for expressing their opinions on the strike, the HALT Act, or other actions taken by the Hochul administration?

Commissioner Martuscello and Governor Hochul have engaged in coercive, unethical, and illegal actions against thousands of correctional officers and prison staff. This blacklist is just the latest of Hochul's abuses of power as she seeks to bully and intimidate. Our brave correctional officers and prison staff deserve better, and New Yorkers deserve to know about Kathy Hochul's underhanded revenge tactics.

'1958565612310999214',"Today’s decision by the New York appeals court to throw out the outrageous and unprecedented $464 million judgment against President Trump is a resounding victory for justice, the rule of law, and the American people. This sham case, orchestrated by radical Democrat Attorney General Letitia James as part of her partisan witch hunt against President Trump, has been exposed for what it always was: a blatant abuse of power and weaponization of our judicial system to interfere in elections and silence political opponents.

From the outset, I have fought tirelessly against this injustice. As a proud New Yorker and defender of our Constitution, I filed an ethics complaint with the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct against Judge Arthur Engoron for his inappropriate bias, judicial intemperance, and repeated violations of judicial ethics including illegal political donations by his staff and unconstitutional gag orders that silenced President Trump. I supplemented this complaint multiple times to highlight the egregious misconduct that undermined public confidence in our courts and turned this trial into a political spectacle. I also filed formal complaints to disbar our disgraceful New York Attorney General Letitia James for her blatant bias and highly inappropriate and prejudicial comments on social media related to this sham case. 

This ruling vindicates not only President Trump but also the countless Americans harmed by the Far Left's illegal weaponized lawfare tactics. Letitia James and her allies must be held accountable for their corrupt actions, and I will continue to lead the charge in Congress to expose and end this weaponization of government.

Our #NY21 federal and state correctional officers have faced significant staffing shortages, dangerous working conditions, and fundamentally failed state policies.

The rest of the United States locality pay rate currently applies to FCI Ray Brook. However, New York suffers proportionally worse than the rest of the country due to the affordability crisis under failed Governor Kathy Hochul. 

We must demand results from both the federal government agencies and our state officials to support our hardworking and dedicated COs who put their lives on the line every single day.

Today, I am announcing I am co-leading the SAFER at the Border Act with @RepLongworthy to keep dangerous criminal illegals from terrorizing New York and our nation’s streets. The legislation closes loopholes that were exploited by Kathy Hochul’s failed policies and Joe Biden’s reckless abuse of immigration parole. 

Terrorists, transnational criminal aliens, and dangerous foreign nationals invaded our sovereign nation under the corrupt and failed leadership of Kathy Hochul. We must put law-abiding New Yorkers first and secure our borders.

'1929210455244824723',"Single party Democrat rule in New York led by Kathy Hochul has led to a severe and dangerous crime crisis in our great state - one of the most significant in the country. 

– Felony assaults are up 19%
– Riders, cops, and MTA workers are being punched and stabbed
– Assaults have skyrocketed 66% since 2019

This is a direct result of Kathy Hochul and NY Democrats failed bail reform, defund the police, sanctuary state, and anti law enforcement policies that put criminals and illegals first and New Yorkers last. 

We need to Back the Blue and reinstate law and order to save New York.

'1924593790083596502',"I’m demanding full transparency from Harvard over its disturbing ties to the Chinese Communist Party and Iran. The evidence is clear:

1️⃣ Harvard repeatedly hosted and trained members of the CCP paramilitary group, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC).
2️⃣ Harvard researchers collaborated with China-based academics on projects funded by an agent of the Iranian government.
3️⃣ Using U.S. Department of Defense funding, Harvard researchers partnered with China-based academics on research with potential military applications.
4️⃣ Harvard researchers worked with individuals tied to China’s defense and industrial base—on research that could aid China’s military modernization.

Harvard must be held accountable.

'1920500053321380054',"Stefanik Rips Gov. Kathy Hochul’s Late, Reckless, and Disgraceful New York State Budget

Democrats and Republicans alike are rightly skewering Kathy Hochul and her budget for her sheer incompetence and catastrophic policies hurting New York. 

Governor Kathy Hochul’s disastrous $254 billion budget is not only the latest budget in over 15 years, but also it is a staggering $13 billion increase over last year’s already bloated budget and it is a double down of her failed policies that have bankrupted New York’s hardworking families. 

Under Kathy Hochul, New York already leads the nation in population loss due to unaffordability, sky-high taxes, and out-of-control crime. Hochul’s latest catastrophic budget will further exacerbate the mass exodus from our great Empire State. 

Even elected Democrats have publicly declared the budget process and outcome ""shameful"" and have shredded various aspects of Hochul’s budget.

Hochul puts New Yorkers last as she pours hard earned taxpayers funds into sanctuary city policies that incentivize illegal immigration all while diverting resources from our underfunded veterans’ services and law enforcement. 

Hochul once again perpetuates New York’s violent crime crisis by refusing to fully repeal disastrous bail reform laws, leaving our neighborhoods less safe and emboldening criminals. 

Her budget doubles down on insane gas stove bans and unaffordable energy regulations that will further crush families and small businesses already grappling with soaring utility bills. 

And in true NY Democrat corruption fashion, the cherry on top is Hochul’s secret taxpayer-funded slush fund for corrupt Tish James to use hard earned NYers money to defend herself in court for her illegal mortgage fraud. 

Truly Democrat corruption at its finest led by Kathy Hochul. 

And as always, Governor Hochul’s refusal to eliminate New York City’s congestion pricing toll—a punishing unaffordable tax opposed by a vast majority of New Yorkers—demonstrates her utter disregard for the financial burdens facing commuters, workers, and small businesses.

The process behind this budget, the latest in 15 years, reeks of cronyism and incompetence. New Yorkers deserve a transparent, fiscally responsible budget that prioritizes our needs, not the desperate attempt to shore up a politically weakened and toxic governor who is desperately trying to shore up her abysmal poll numbers.

As the highest-ranking Republican in New York, I resolutely oppose Hochul's unaffordable plan and will continue fighting to restore commonsense policies that put New Yorkers FIRST. 

Change is coming. And we must work together to SAVE NEW YORK from Hochul’s sheer incompetence and ineptitude.",en,Tweet,1,132,45,21,5945,2025-05-08 16:24:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

""Kathy Hochul’s criminal-first Parole Board is considering parole for a violent criminal thug who threw a brave NYPD cop off a Times Square roof. This is a disgusting betrayal of law enforcement and law-abiding New Yorkers.

Only in Kathy Hochul’s New York would such a vile criminal get another shot at freedom. Hochul puts criminals first and brave law enforcement and New Yorkers dead last. Hochul’s failure to fire soft-on-crime Parole Board members fuels this outrage, letting dangerous felons threaten our streets.

As Governor, Hochul has the power to remove these commissioners for cause yet she refuses to clean house. Her weak leadership emboldens criminals and endangers our communities.

This bill undermines the fundamental principle that all life is sacred, a value I have fought for in Congress.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Far Left Albany Democrats passed the devastating HALT Act which resulted in assaults on officers skyrocketing by 76%, extreme working hours for correctional officers including 48 to even 72-hour shifts, and staffing shortages causing chaos and grave danger at our prisons. For too long, the concerns of our correctional officers advocating for necessary reforms have fallen on totally deaf ears in Albany. Kathy Hochul must take immediate action to ensure the hardworking correctional officers of New York can do their jobs safely and effectively.

The world must never forget that Hamas terrorists savagely murdered over 1,200 innocent civilians including women, children, babies, and the elderly and took hundreds hostage committing unspeakable atrocities against humanity on October 7th. As we learn more about the tragic fates and devastating loss of life of these innocent victims, we are reminded that this must not be Israel’s fight alone but a fight between good and evil, civilization and barbarity. It has never been more important to show our unequivocal support for our most precious ally and it is clear that under President Trump’s leadership, America stands steadfast in support of Israel and the Jewish people.
