Congressman Patronis: Congress Delivered a Big, Beautiful Victory for America
 
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Jimmy Patronis issued a statement on the second and final passage of H.R. 1 – One, Big Beautiful Bill Act. President Donald J. Trump is expected to sign the One, Big, Beautiful Bill on the Fourth of July.
 
Congressman Jimmy Patronis said, “With the final passage of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill, Congress has delivered a historic win for the American people. Thanks to the leadership of Speaker Johnson and President Trump, this legislation will extend and make permanent many of the Trump Tax Cuts, reignite America’s economy, and restore the American dream for working families. This bill has lots to love, but as tourism is a huge economic driver for our region, no taxes on tips will benefit families all throughout the Panhandle. It also secures the border by providing $175 billion, the largest border security investment in history. Also, the bill provides important funding for Coast Guard readiness and increases American military superiority around the world. The Democrats who voted no for this bill supported cutting the Child Tax Credit in half and increasing taxes for the average American by 22 percent. I was proud to vote alongside the majority of my Republican colleagues to ensure that Floridians and small businesses in my district experience lower taxes, higher wages, and safer communities. I look forward to President Trump signing the One, Big, Beautiful Bill into law and making America wealthy, safe, proud, and great again!”
 
One, Big, Beautiful Bill Wins:
 
•Makes Trump Tax Cuts Permanent. Saves Americans from a 22% tax increase.

•Makes Child Tax Credit Permanent. Prevents the Child Tax Credit from being cut in half.

•Bolsters our military and national security. Provides $150 billion to modernize the military.

•Secures our Southern Border. Makes historic investments to finish the Border Wall.

•No tax on tips. Raises real wages for every American worker.

•No tax on overtime. 100 percent elimination of overtime taxes for over 80 million workers.

•Tax relief for seniors. Middle and low-income seniors will be able to deduct an additional $6,000.

Congressman @JimmyPatronis: We’re Putting America’s Veterans First

WASHINGTON, D.C. –  Today, Congressman Patronis applauded the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of H.R. 3944 – The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2026, which allocated more than $152 billion towards critical investments in military infrastructure that support readiness. This bill fully funds veterans’ health care programs, veterans’ benefits, and VA programs, providing more than $452 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs. That’s more than $82 billion above the enacted level for Fiscal Year 2025. Congressman Patronis voted in support of the legislation. 

Congressman Patronis said, “I’m grateful for @POTUS and @SpeakerJohnson’s leadership in the passage of this pro-military, pro-veteran legislation. This bill puts America’s veterans, active-duty military, and their families first by providing historic funding that increases the readiness of our troops and ensures that our veterans and military families receive the care and support they need back home. It also bolsters our national security, enhances border protections, and prevents any efforts to undermine veterans’ Second Amendment rights. This bill will go a long way toward assisting the many veterans and military families in Florida’s First Congressional District and ensure our heroes in uniform are well-prepared to defend the homeland. 

“This Military Construction and Veteran Affairs bill allocates $75 million for the design and planning of future barracks, $2 billion for military family housing, and fully funds veterans’ medical care at more than $131 billion, which will go towards veterans’ benefits and toxic exposure-related needs. I’m also pleased to report that this funding measure includes more than $970 million for the Bridging Rental Assistance for Veteran Empowerment program, which is an initiative dedicated to ending veteran homelessness. Our heroes in uniform put their lives on the line 24/7/365, and this bill honors both their sacrifices and those of our nation’s veterans.”

Veterans Appropriation Bill’s Focused Priorities

•$452 Billion - U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
•$18 Billion - Military Construction and Family Housing
•$340 Million - Battle Monuments, Cemeteries, Armed Forces Retirement

2.) It’ll increase demand for these jobs = better service for customers.

Congressman Patronis Files Bill to Streamline Environmental Permits
 
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Jimmy Patronis filed H.R. 3902 – Restoring Federalism in Clean Water Permitting Act aimed at cutting red tape surrounding the Section 404 permitting process, which often hampers projects that create jobs and support community priorities. This bill mandates that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator review regulations relating to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act that allow states to assume the environmental approval processes. The goal of this review is to identify ways to reduce administrative burdens and to encourage states to manage their own permit programs. Congressman Patronis is a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure(T&I).
 
Congressman Jimmy Patronis said, “Florida is home to many rich ecosystems that attract millions of people from around the globe to visit our state. Our springs and waterways are some of the most vibrant and pristine in the world, in no small part, due to Florida’s Department of Environmental Protection and water management districts working with local, state, and federal stakeholders to keep them preserved. Many states, like Florida, have the ability to conduct environmental reviews of projects and do so in a timely manner. What we saw under the Biden Administration, however, was the Section 404 process being used to sandbag good projects. Reform is clearly needed as nearly half of states have expressed interest in assuming Section 404 and only three states have EPA-approved programs. With H.R. 3902, Congress will direct the Administrator to conduct a deep dive on the 404 processes, so important projects that aren’t harmful to the environment can get greenlighted without having to deal with bureaucratic or judicial red tape.”
 
T&I Chairman Sam Graves said, “Congressman Patronis’ bill will encourage the EPA to make important reforms to the Section 404 permit assumption process, paving the way for more states to take the lead in issuing these critical permits, which are used in a variety of infrastructure projects—from energy projects to road construction projects to water resource projects. I want to thank Congressman Patronis for his leadership on this issue by taking a critical step in restoring federalism in the Clean Water Act through common-sense reforms that empower states.”

Congressman Patronis Appointed to House Committee on Small Business
 
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Jimmy Patronis announced his appointment to the United States House of Representatives Committee on Small Business. In addition to the Committee on Small Business, Congressman Patronis is expected to serve on the Subcommittee on Rural Development, Energy, and Supply Chains; the Subcommittee on Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Workforce Development; and the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Regulations.
 
Congressman Jimmy Patronis said, “I’m honored to be appointed to the House Committee on Small Business and look forward to being a strong voice for hardworking Floridians and small businesses that form the backbone of America’s economy. More than 33 million small businesses in the United States account for more than 43% of the nation’s total GDP. Florida is home to more than three million small businesses, which make up more than 99% of all businesses in the state. My thanks to @SpeakerJohnson, Majority Leader @SteveScalise, Majority Whip @tomemmer, and Small Business Committee Chairman @RepRWilliams for the opportunity to help craft and support policies that will foster fiscal responsibility, cut red tape, and grow an economy that works for everyone. As a former small business owner and working my entire life in the restaurant business, I know how hard it is for small business owners to earn a living and make payroll. I’m excited to work with my colleagues on the Committee to protect our small businesses, provide better opportunities to live the American dream, and help President Trump Make America Wealthy Again.”
 
House Committee on Small Business Chairman Roger Williams said, “I want to congratulate Rep. Patronis on his appointment to the House Committee on Small Business for the 119th Congress. His dedication to America’s small businesses and real-world experience will bring valuable insight to the Committee. I look forward to working together as we tackle the challenges facing Main Street and champion pro-growth solutions over the next two years.”
 
The U.S. House Committee on Small Business was created to craft better protections and government policies for America’s Small Businesses. The Committee is responsible for evaluating and addressing the challenges faced by small businesses and analyzing how broader business practices and trends affect them. The Committee holds legislative and oversight authority over the Small Business Administration and its initiatives. It also supports and safeguards small businesses by facilitating access to financial assistance and promoting their involvement in federal procurement and government contracting opportunities.
