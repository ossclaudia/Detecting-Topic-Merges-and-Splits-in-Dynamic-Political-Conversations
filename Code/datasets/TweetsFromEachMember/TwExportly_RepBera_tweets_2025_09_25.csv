'1940897995454607462',"Read my full statement on today's vote: 

“As a doctor, I have seen firsthand what happens when people lose access to health care. Patients skip checkups and go without medications. Chronic conditions worsen, small problems turn into major health crises, and preventable illnesses become emergencies. But that’s exactly what Republicans just voted to do. Their bill makes deep cuts to Medicaid, putting health care at risk for millions of children, seniors, women, and people with disabilities. These cuts will force more people to delay care, crowd our emergency rooms, drive up hospital and pharmacy costs, and ultimately make health care more expensive for everyone. That is not just bad for families—it harms our entire health care system and weakens our economy.

“Part of the reason I first ran for Congress was to improve our health care system and protect patients. I’m proud of the work Democrats have done in recent years to expand coverage—helping millions of Americans gain access to care, lower out-of-pocket costs, and move us closer to universal coverage. But this bill reverses that progress, stripping health care from nearly 17 million Americans—including more than 2 million Californians—and putting some of the most vulnerable people in our communities at risk.

“As the son of immigrants, I know the value of hard work, opportunity, and a community that invests in its people. That is the American Dream—the belief that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can build a better life for you and your family. That’s why I’ve always believed in working across the aisle to support working- and middle-class Americans. But any honest conversation about tax policy must start with fairness. Corporations and the ultra-wealthy must pay their fair share. This bill isn’t about fiscal responsibility—it’s about locking in permanent tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy by extending Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. It adds $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, while shifting more of the burden onto working families who are already struggling to make ends meet.

“Although this bill now heads to President Trump’s desk, our work is far from over. I will continue to speak out against these harmful policies and fight for an agenda that protects health care and keeps the American Dream alive for working- and middle-class Americans.”
