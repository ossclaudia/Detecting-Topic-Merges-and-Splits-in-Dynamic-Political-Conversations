Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy was one of our nation’s great champions in the fight against gun violence.

In 1993, Carolyn’s husband, Dennis, was murdered, and her son was seriously wounded by the LIRR gunman who opened fire on a crowded Long Island Railroad car.

Carolyn channeled her grief and loss into advocacy for change, becoming one of the most dedicated gun violence prevention advocates.

I first met Carolyn in early 1994, when I was the young mayor of Glen Cove, and her son, Kevin, was undergoing rehabilitation at Glen Cove Hospital. I followed her closely from her entry into politics and throughout her years in office. Our nation and our Island have lost a fierce champion.

Their act of peaceful protest was met with brutal violence; state troopers beat and tear-gassed the demonstrators, leaving Lewis with severe injuries, including a fractured skull. This harrowing event, now known as Bloody Sunday, became a catalyst for the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965.

The Chinese Communist Party is pressuring Thailand to deport and forcibly repatriate 43 Uyghur refugees, currently detained in Thailand, to China. If the Thai government forces them back to China, these innocent people face torture, ethnic cleansing, or death in forced labor camps. We are hoping Thailand will live up to their obligations under the Convention Against Torture, which they ratified, and which prohibits the return of people to countries where they face torture.

I am respectfully calling on the Thai government to immediately halt this unconscionable deportation and turn these refugees over to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees.

· Eight years ago, I met a 14-year-old Solomon Schechter School freshman at the local Salute to Israel event at the Sid Jacobson JCC on Long Island. His name was Omer Neutra. When I met Omer’s parents, Ronen and Orna Neutra, in December 2023, they described Omer as a “likable” “big, goofy kid,” who excelled in sports, and who other kids liked to be around. After graduating from Solomon Schechter School, Omer, whose grandparents were Holocaust survivors, decided that before going to Binghamton University, he would join the Israel Defense Forces. Instead of just staying for a year, he worked his way up to become a tank commander.

· On October 7th, 2023, Omer was a victim of the surprise attack by the Hamas terrorists.

· For 420 days, Omer’s parents, and his brother Daniel, have done everything they can, with the love and support of hundreds of thousands of others, to free their son from captivity. Every day, they soldiered on through alternating deep sorrow and brief bursts of hopefulness. They went from crushing anxiety to steely determination…

· Yesterday morning, we learned that this young man, this bright light, this courageous idealist, … made the ultimate sacrifice. Omer has not been alive for the past 422 days. He was murdered on October 7th.

· Now all of his family’s alternating emotions have been replaced with deep grief. We who know them, grieve with them. We thank God for the gift of his life. We pray for the Neutras. And tonight, we rededicate ourselves to Omer’s just cause. We resolve to move forward, guided by his example, his courage, and his memory.

'1857140371886621113',"Today marks #WorldDiabetesDay , a day that honors the contributions of Sir Frederick Banting, one of the pioneers who discovered insulin in 1921. 

Back in 1923, when insulin was patented, Banting and his fellow researchers made a groundbreaking decision. They declined to put their names on the patent and sold it to the University of Toronto for just $1. Their perspective was clear: it was unethical for a doctor to profit from a life-saving discovery, and they wanted to ensure that everyone who needed insulin could afford it.

Fast forward over a century, and it’s clear that Banting and his colleagues would be dismayed to witness how their life-saving medication has become synonymous with pharmaceutical price gouging. Stories of individuals with diabetes forced to ration their insulin—sometimes with fatal consequences—are all too common. This is a moral outrage.

Now, more than ever, it’s crucial to safeguard the Inflation Reduction Act, which enables Medicare to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers and caps insulin prices at $35 for Medicare recipients. We must stand firm against any efforts to roll back these essential protections. Together, we can ensure that life-saving medications remain accessible for all.",en,Tweet,2,9,2,0,1019,2024-11-14 19:15:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",#WorldDiabetesDay,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcXjUxMXkAAYcbL.jpg

Iran has been expanding its terrorist network ever since the American hostages were taken in 1979. 

Hamas’ barbaric attacks and taking innocent Israelis as hostages on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah’s hundreds of missiles fired at Israel, the Houthi attacks in the Mediterranean, and dozens of lesser-known terrorist attacks were all promulgated by Iran. 

The United States and the West generally have tried diplomacy and sanctions, yet Iran continues its provocative aggression and its build-up of nuclear capability. Its attack on Israel yesterday and Israel’s willingness to respond must be embraced and supported by the United States and all freedom-loving countries.",en,Tweet,12,440,65,37,28293,2024-10-02 18:13:51,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Yesterday, I presented a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol to Cold Spring Harbor High School at The Remembrance Project game during Cold Spring Harbor HS’s homecoming.

During WWII, in the late fall of 1944, with Paris secure and ultimate victory inevitable, a football game was organized for Christmas Day. The 101st Airborne Division paratroopers, who had already seen hard fighting in Normandy and the Netherlands, planned what they named the Champagne Bowl. The big game was set to take place on December 25, 1944. When the Battle of the Bulge broke out, the soldiers had to drop everything and march to the Ardennes, abandoning what would become known as The Game That Never Happened.

These “Remembrance” games serve to remind us of those young soldiers that never had a chance to play their game, and instead went off to one of the deadliest campaigns of WWII.",en,Tweet,0,11,0,1,833,2024-09-28 14:39:12,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYkTlEwWYAAHPSv.jpg
