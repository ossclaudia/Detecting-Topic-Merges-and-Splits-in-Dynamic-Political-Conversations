'1919845494358212717',"🚨@AGPamBondi announced the largest drug bust in U.S. history, targeting one of the largest drug trafficking and terrorist organizations in our country!

🚨What does that mean for Kentucky? The amount of drugs that were stopped from coming into our communities from this single drug bust was enough to kill 71% of Kentuckians. @uniteky 

🚨This historic drug bust led to the arrest of six people living in our country illegally who were running a massive drug operation. 

🚨The @DEAHQ seized a total of:
-11.5 kilos of fentanyl, including 3 million fentanyl pills – stamped as oxycodone
-$5 million in cash
-35 kilos of meth
-7.5 kilos of cocaine
-4.5 kilos of heroin
-49 rifles and pistols

As a result of the federal investigation, DEA arrested one of the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel in Oregon, and seized illicit drugs in New Mexico, Arizona & Utah.

75,000 Americans have been dying of fentanyl-related overdose deaths each year. Fentanyl-related overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 34. 

Since @POTUS took office in January 2025, nearly 30 million fentanyl-laced pills have already been seized, protecting our communities and keeping these deadly pills from reaching the hands of our loved ones.

Thank you, @POTUS, @AGPamBondi, @DEAHQ and all the law enforcement officers involved in this life-saving drug bust!
