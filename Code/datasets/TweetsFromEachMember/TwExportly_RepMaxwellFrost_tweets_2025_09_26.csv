'1844080309253570647',"A tornado WATCH means BE PREPARED.  If there is a tornado watch, tornadoes are possible! Pay extra close attention to the weather and be ready to act. Preparing ahead of time helps to save lives!

A tornado WARNING means TAKE ACTION.  If there is a tornado warning, a tornado is imminent or already occurring. Seek shelter immediately -- move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. Avoid windows and cover your head to protect yourself from flying debris.

Fact: This is false. No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.

Fact:
This is false.
FEMA is not blockading people in Florida and preventing evacuations. FEMA does not control traffic flow or conduct traffic stops, which are handled by local authorities. This is a harmful rumor that can put lives in danger.

If you live in the west coast of Florida and the Florida peninsula, take immediate action to protect yourself and your loved ones. Follow the guidance of your local authorities.
