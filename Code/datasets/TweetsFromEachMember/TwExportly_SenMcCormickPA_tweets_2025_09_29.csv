Growing up on this campus, some of my earliest memories are of walking with my parents and brother for dinner in the student dining hall. What stands out isn’t the meals – or even the soft-serve ice cream he and I loved – but the way my parents greeted everyone we passed – students, professors, staff – with a warm hello and genuine conversation.
 
Looking back, I see how deeply my parents cared about this university – the quality of the education and creating an environment where students could learn and realize their dreams. They poured themselves into the job and they recognized the power education had to shape our country’s future.

'1944388838417187146',"I was sitting just 15 feet from the stage at the Butler rally when the shots rang out. Moments before the attempted assassination, President Trump asked me to come on stage to give my remarks. As I was headed onstage, he prompted me to wait until after he spoke to the crowd about an immigration chart. Returning to my seat, I watched as President Trump turned his attention and head towards the chart—a decision that likely saved his life. Moments later, a bullet meant for his head struck his ear. He went down, then stood up and raised his fist in defiance. That moment captured who he is at his core—a strong leader—and marked a turning point in the 2024 election.
 
Strong leadership sets a tone -- like a ripple effect. President Trump didn’t panic and stood strong and so did the crowd. Instead of chaos, chants of “USA”rang out. 
 
But the day also brought great tragedy. Corey Comperatore—a Pennsylvanian, volunteer firefighter, and father—was sitting behind me. He died shielding his family. I’m remembering Corey and praying for the Comperatore family on this one-year anniversary.
 
From the attempts on President Trump's life, to arson at the Pennsylvania Governor’s Residence, to the murder of Minnesota State Rep.

'1940082547813240999',"I am proud to support this bill because it would deliver continued tax relief to millions of Pennsylvania families and prevent the largest tax increase in American history. This bill also delivers on many of the promises that both President Trump and I made – to secure our nation’s border and bolster our national defense to keep Americans safe, and to unleash American energy potential and lower costs for consumers.
 
Pennsylvania’s families and workers will see significant benefits from this bill – from an increase to the Child Tax Credit to making permanent the doubling of the standard deduction and the Employer Paid Family and Medical Leave tax credit. Most importantly, this bill stops the largest tax increase in American history by making the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, saving the average Pennsylvania family $2,500 each year while also giving workers no tax on tips and no tax on overtime. Finally, we made a positive step forward on school choice.
 
No bill is perfect, but these provisions will make a real difference in the lives of people working hard to make ends meet and raise their families across the Commonwealth. I also believe that the historic investments in the border, law enforcement, and defense will benefit all Pennsylvanians in the coming years, as will the important provisions that will unleash Pennsylvania energy.

'1931073425449095182',"On the 81st Anniversary of D-Day, let us remember Pennsylvanian, @USArmy paratrooper, and Easy Company Commander, Major Richard ‘Dick’ Winters, who wrote his 10 Rules of Leadership after Band of Brothers was published. These rules have guided my service in the Army, my business career, and my time serving Pennsylvania in the US Senate. ⬇️🇺🇸

1. Strive to be a leader of character competence, and courage.

2. Lead from the front. Say “Follow me!” and then lead the way.

3. Stay in top physical shape – physical stamina is the root of mental toughness.

4. Develop your team. If you know your people, are fair in setting realistic goals and expectations, and lead by example, you will develop teamwork.

5. Delegate responsibility to your subordinates and let them do their jobs. You can’t do a good job if you don’t have a chance to use your imagination or your creativity.

6. Anticipate problems and prepare to overcome obstacles. Don’t wait until you get to the top of the ridge and then make up your mind.

7. Remain humble. Don’t worry about who receives the credit. Never let power or authority go to your head.

8. Take a moment of self-reflection. Look at yourself in the mirror every night and ask yourself if you did your best.

9. True satisfaction comes from getting the job done. The key to a successful leader is to earn respect – not because of rank or position, but because you are a leader of character.

10. Hang tough! Never, ever, give up.",en,Tweet,2,27,3,4,1496,2025-06-06 20:39:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1885165430353846412',"Since Hamas massacred and kidnapped hundreds of innocent Israelis on October 7, we’ve seen historic levels of antisemitism across our country, especially on our college campuses. I’ve seen this firsthand in Pennsylvania’s neighborhoods and universities. 
 
Yesterday, @POTUS signed a pivotal executive order to address this discrimination against our Jewish communities. This is a critical first step.
 
By expanding enforcement and monitoring tools, increasing reporting requirements, and holding institutions accountable, this executive order will help protect Jewish students and communities from further discrimination, vandalism, and violence.

Part of that accountability is to do what I proposed months ago and raised with Secretary of State Rubio in his confirmation hearing - foreign nationals who incite violence or endorse terrorist activity by supporting Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and attacks against Jews are in violation of the terms of their visas and should no longer be welcomed as guests of America.
