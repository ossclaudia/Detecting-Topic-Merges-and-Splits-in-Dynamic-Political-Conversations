'1891653866606952787',"Tomorrow, the Senate will move the nomination of @kash_patel for FBI Director. While President Trump lets @elonmusk run wild grifting and slashing the federal government, Trump has been mainly focused on his revenge and retribution tour. Patel is *the* one he cares most about. Here’s why. 

First, let’s recap what Trump has done in four weeks to eliminate accountability in the executive branch:

1) fired 20 inspectors generals, including the independent Office of Special Counsel and the Director of the Office of Government Ethics.

2) purged FBI agents and prosecutors involved with the criminal cases against him.

3) installed his criminal defense lawyer to run DOJ who has already blatantly weaponized it. 

4) pulled security clearance and security protection for anyone who has challenged him.

5) pardoned ALL J6 criminals, including violent ones, effectively creating his own extremist militia.

In sum, Trump has cleared the decks for Patel to do what he repeatedly promised to do over the past few years: get revenge and retribution for his overlord. 

Second, let’s look at who Patel is:

1) brief tenure as mediocre national security lawyer for DOJ before a short stint on the House Intelligence Committee before joining Trump’s national security council where he was best known for funneling false information from Rudy Giuliani and others directly to Trump. 

2) worked outside ethics rules/chain of command on Russia investigation and Ukraine investigation.

3) paid FBI whistleblowers who testified in Congress. 

4) defended violent J6 criminals. 

5) wrote a children’s book about “King Donald.”

6) published an enemies list.

7) declared that Trump declassified documents by “thinking it,” which led to him requiring immunity from prosecution in order to testify before the Grand Jury. 

8) uniformly panned as corrupt and unqualified by Trump’s own officials (Barr, Bolton, Haspel). 

Since his nomination, this is what we’ve learned:

1) he repeatedly lied under oath, in ways big and small (ie defined the word “we” to not include himself, said he did know extremist podcast host whose show he appeared on eight times, etc).

2) according to credible whistleblowers, he directed the purges of FBI officials, even though he testified under oath that he had nothing to do with it. 

3) Refused to provide his grand jury testimony (which only he can do) and DOJ blocked the release of Volume 2 of Special Counsel report in which he’s reportedly extensively involved.

4) concealed from the Senate shady foreign business deals with China.

AG Pam Bondi promised under oath that she would not use the DOJ for political purposes. She broke that promise in her first week.
