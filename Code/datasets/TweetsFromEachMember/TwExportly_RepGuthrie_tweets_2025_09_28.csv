'1955034918192321001',".@GovAndyBeshear, enough with the fear mongering. Here’s the truth about how the One, Big, Beautiful Bill will strengthen Medicaid for Kentucky’s most vulnerable. ⬇️

➡️ The “coverage loss” you cite stems from the state’s provider tax payments. The state made a commitment to fund 10% of Medicaid – the federal government will continue to cover our 90%, and actually increase funding. The federal government will continue to honor our commitment.

➡️ Our bill does nothing to impact Medicaid benefits for mothers and children.

➡️ The people who will lose access to Medicaid under our bill are able-bodied individuals who choose not to work, or are already ineligible to receive benefits under the program. This plan is simply the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid. 

➡️ You claim that 35 rural Kentucky hospitals will close as a result of our bill. Last week, I visited several rural hospitals in my district that you claim will close because of our bill. Every single one of them has said they will stay open providing care to Kentuckians.

Again, enough with the attempts to scare people. Being a leader means making responsible decisions for taxpayers and the most vulnerable in our Commonwealth. Our bill does exactly that.",en,Tweet,12,363,119,156,72722,2025-08-11 23:33:41,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
