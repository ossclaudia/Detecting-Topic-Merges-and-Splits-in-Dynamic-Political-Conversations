'1894113820706033952',"Three years ago today, Putin sent his army into Ukraine, shattering peace in Europe and threatening global stability. Putin’s autocratic friends in China, Iran, and North Korea quickly came to his aid, bolstering Russia’s defense industrial base and sending thousands of troops to fight and kill the Ukrainian people. Make no mistake: This unholy alliance formed by our adversaries seeks to undermine western values, weaken U.S. national security, and upend the global balance of power.

I agree with President Trump that this would never have happened had he been in office. There’s a reason these hostile regimes did not attack sovereign territories during his first term: He projected peace through strength. All the pain and bloodshed in Europe could have been prevented if Democrats — under both the Obama and Biden administrations — had stood up to Putin sooner.

This war has raged for three years too many. Putin could stop the killing today, but since he refuses — President Trump has answered the call to help put an end to the fighting. As he and his team continue negotiations, I urge them to ensure the agreement holds the Kremlin accountable for its crimes and contains serious teeth to ensure Putin cannot resurrect his quest to recreate the Soviet Union by taking Ukraine. Only then will lasting peace be secured.",en,Tweet,3,24,5,21,4885,2025-02-24 19:55:00,"<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web Client</a>",,,,
