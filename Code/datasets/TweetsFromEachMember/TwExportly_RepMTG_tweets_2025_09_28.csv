'1963959116591673463',"The argument of which drives the national debt more, Social Security or U.S. spending on Israel/foreign countries/foreign wars, is fundamentally America First versus America Last.

Americans are taxed at gun point for Social Security with 6.2% being forcibly withheld from their paycheck and employers are taxed at gunpoint and forced to match each employees contribution at 6.2% and self employed individuals are taxed at gun point being forced to pay the entire 12.4% on earnings.

The government’s failures on Social Security is a separate debate, but Social Security is FOR AMERICANS and Americans deserve every penny.

Foreign countries do not deserve American’s hard earned tax dollars and anyone demanding they do should register under FARA.

This 2022 estimate of the government’s spending of $8 TRILLION American tax dollars on foreign wars since 9/11, doesn’t include the hundreds of billions for Ukraine, however that $8 TRILLION spent was America LAST and unnecessarily drove America’s national debt.

But attacking Ana Kasperian or anyone else with “Jew hatred” for demanding that we stop funding Israel and every other foreign country, and foreign wars, is completely unacceptable and turning many Americans off.

It’s absurd really.

The reality is Americans have been chained in over $37 TRILLION in debt and Americans deserve their Social Security money they were FORCED to pay!

The nuclear armed secular government of Israel is such a successful country that they have less than $400 billion in national debt and provide government funded healthcare and education to their citizens. 

Daily, Israel is proving that on their own, they are more than capable of destroying their enemies with no one’s help, as they not only destroy their enemies, they also destroy innocent lives.

Saying stop giving Israel $3.8 billion dollars a year isn’t Jew hatred or antisemitism, it’s just as simple as saying America can’t afford it anymore and shouldn’t have to continue paying.

I absolutely adamantly refused to get the Covid vaccine and I, and many others like me, are extremely glad we did NOT get the mandated vaccines.

I also have great empathy for all of those who were forced to take it in order to keep their jobs or to continue their education.

Millions of people have reported vaccine injuries and deaths from taking the forced Covid vaccines.

And people have continuously died suddenly, developed cancer, and suffered heart damage, neurological problems, and more from taking Covid vaccines and boosters.

And for what?

A man made virus that was pretty much only dangerous to the elderly, immune compromised, diabetics, and obese people in our population, which by the way are also at risk from the flu and any other virus or infection.

But in this circumstance those war torn children are from Gaza and this foreign child sex predator is from Israel and works directly for Netanyahu.

Let me guess.

Would it be antisemitic to drag Netanyahu’s Cyber Executive Director back and prosecute this pos to the full extent of the law and at the same time let Palestinian kids who had their limbs and bodies blown apart receive surgeries in America? 

I’m not saying bring in refugees or use tax payer dollars, not at all, but when did America’s heart grow so cold to refuse innocent children privately funded surgeries and then they return home after they recover?

Wouldn’t we allow Israeli children if they were the ones needing surgery?

Or war torn children from any other country?

And the most concerning question is when and how did America become so subservient to Israel that we immediately release a CHILD SEX PREDATOR after arrest, with a 100% locked up case with evidence, and let him off to fly back home to Israel??

That is quite a statement and is an acknowledgment that nuclear armed Israel is more than capable of defending themselves, by themselves, and not only defeating their enemies, but completely wiping them out!

So why is America funding them and fighting for them??!!!

We should not be!! 

And it is not a matter of supporting either Israel or Hamas, as he suggest, which is ridiculous.  

It is about supporting AMERICA!!!

Lindsey Graham has no children.

I have 3 adult children, who are 22, 25, and 27, which gives me a fierce invested interest to be ALL IN to save America.

And we are now a nation in $37 TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT because of the NON-STOP votes and funding for foreign countries and foreign wars and bloated budgets and pork and waste for over 30 years, which is how long Lindsey Graham has been serving in Washington DC.

And the gross negligent consequences of America LAST decisions by MOST politicians in Washington DC has not only chained all of us and our future generations in debt, but eroded the value of our dollar, driven out of control inflation making life completely unaffordable, and is destroying the middle class and turning my children’s generation into the WORKING POOR!!!

WHICH PISSES ME OFF!!!

The sirens should be blaring in Washington DC with an all hands on deck panic mentality that every single elected member of congress and senator should be working as hard as possible to prevent our inevitable demise.

But instead, even after the America First mandate was delivered in the election of 2024, tone deaf Politicians in the swamp still slither up to podiums to deliver speeches that sound like the same Bush era propaganda that has led to 22 veteran suicides a day, every day, from devastating PTSD brought home from pointless foreign wars.

I am also completely amazed that Israel and their aligned groups like AIPAC (who is breaking the law by not registering under FARA) takes Members of Congress, and Conservative social media influencers (like TPUSA) on all expenses paid trips to Israel, and welcomes a steady stream of conservative media outlets in order to keep the funding stream going.

Can you imagine if Russia did this???

All hell broke loose when Tucker Carlson dared to show clean subways and well stocked grocery stores in Moscow!

We can support our allies, but our elected officials should not be funded or going on funded trips for the interest of foreign countries.

And God will not pull the plug on us, if we stop funding the secular government of Israel.

This is 1,000% false and is the fear mongering tactic used on good hearted American Christians to force us to fund and fight the secular government of nuclear armed Israel’s wars.

We don’t believe we go to heaven based on how much money we blindly give and how many bombs we drop on the secular government of Israel’s enemies.

Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” John 14:6

Jesus was extremely clear about how we should treat others, especially children.

Funding and blindly supporting an ally who is starving children is not going to bring God’s favor on America, as a matter of fact, I’ll argue it will instead bring God’s wrath.

America’s intervention should be to stop the war and work for peace and demand the release of the poor Oct 7th hostages, while equally demanding to stop the genocide and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Nothing. He spoke at a Democrat convention. But Laura Loomer has ZERO respect or reverence for even the most heroic people in America. Ask any veteran, military member, and American, no one cares about his politics, the man was willing to die to save others from a suicide bomber.

Shut up Laura.

But there is more. She is using a Medal of Honor recipient as a pawn to attack Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll because they honored him.

Laura Loomer will lie about and slander the best people in order to rip apart other Republicans she is trying to destroy.

Because she is not MAGA, she is MIGA.

Not that they will necessarily flip Democrat because Democrats 100% support the war in Ukraine because it was really started under Obama/Biden. It’s a Democrat driven war that also amassed the usual neocon Republican support.

There are children starving. 

And Christians have been killed and injured, as well as many innocent people. 

If you are an American Christian, this should be absolutely unacceptable to you. 

Just as we said that Hamas killing and kidnapping innocent people on Oct 7th is absolutely unacceptable.

Are innocent Israeli lives more valuable than innocent  Palestinian and Christian lives?

And why should America continue funding this?

The secular government of nuclear armed Israel has proven that they are beyond capable of dealing with their enemies and are capable  of and are in the process of systematically cleansing them from the land. 

Most Americans that I know don’t hate Israel and we are not antisemitic at all.

We are beyond fed up with being told that we have to fix the world’s problems, pay for the world’s problems, and fight all the world’s wars while Americans are struggling to survive even though they work everyday.

And many of us, even though we are Christians, no longer want to fund and fight nuclear armed secular Israel’s wars especially when it leads to starving children and killing innocent people including Christians.

Of course we are against radical Islamic terrorism, but we are also against genocide.

You see..

When you have worked your entire life, and will only receive a $1,000 Social Security check, but noncitizens were given $3,500 and more, you are pissed off.

When you have worked your entire life, and all your elected federal officials have recklessly spent and sent your hard earned money to every foreign country and every foreign war and NGO to the point we are almost $40 TRILLION in debt and inflation has caused life to be unaffordable, you are pissed off.

When you have worked your entire life, and your elected federal government officials refuse to fix the absurd problems that makes all insurance unaffordable, you are pissed off.

And for the younger generations, who are trying their hardest to make it in this ridiculous system, they feel hopeless! 

And that makes me burn with anger.

None of this is antisemitic and I, along with millions of Americans, refuse that manipulative label.

It’s the consequences of decades of America LAST policies, nonstop foreign intervention, and the American people clearly seeing the truth and suffering.

Here is where I stand.

No American should face persecution of any kind because of their identity.

Not Jewish American.

Not Muslim American.

Not Christian American.

Not White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, mixed American.

And on and on.

We already have hate crime laws against that and that’s not who we are in America and we have and should continue to work hard to not allow ourselves to become that.

My position is this.

As a U.S. Representative, I represent the American people. 

My full focus is on fixing America’s problems.

And right now, the problems in America are threatening my children’s future.

I consider that a war against my children.

Every single person, no matter who they are that continues to enslave my children in debt, continues policies that make their lives unaffordable, and prioritizes foreign countries and foreign wars above my children’s lives and livelihoods, I see as the enemy waging the war against my children and their generation.

I will continue to push for world peace because that is the type of world I want for my children and all the world’s children.

I want America to put American companies and American jobs first and to protect American land and American homes from foreign consumption. 

Most importantly, I demand the federal government serve the American people, who pay your salaries.

1 in 3 American homeowners has built up more equity than the federal capital gains tax exclusion for single filers protects. That means nearly 29 MILLION households could face a tax of up to 20% on the profit from their home sale—simply for staying put and watching their home values rise.

With high inflation and high cost of living, you shouldn’t have to pay HIGH taxes on the home equity you earned! 

HIGH TAXES are UN-AMERICAN and honestly UNFAIR!

For many seniors, who would pay $50,000 to $100,000 or even more in Capital Gains taxes, my bill would allow them to KEEP THEIR MONEY and finally sell their home. 

We can easily pass my bill, No Tax On Home Sales Act, by putting it in the next recision package that will be signed into law by President Trump!

Imagine this paired with lower interest rates and many Americans will finally be able to sell their home, keep the equity they’ve earned, and new and younger buyers will have the opportunity to realize the American dream of owning their own home!

'1948400163875152237',"I have many concerns about the AI Executive Order signed yesterday by President Trump.

While I understand the many promised benefits of AI, I remain committed to protecting state rights, human jobs, human lives, human rights, our environment and critical water supply.

My deep concerns are that the EO demands rapid AI expansion with little to no guardrails and breaks. It also contains the threat of withholding federal funds from states who regulate AI, which is an absolute threat to federalism and why I strongly opposed the AI state moratorium originally in the BBB.

Rushed AI expansion and data centers being built all over the country from state to state with no plan in regards to environmental and critical water supply impact has massive future implications and problems. 

I’ve been in construction my entire life.

I can tell you firsthand, when you move dirt there is always an impact to the surrounding area.

When you build something that requires a HIGH water demand, it will always take water away from others - that means people, cities, businesses, and surrounding counties and states. 

Data centers are like a black holes when it comes to water requirements. They consume massive amounts of water for cooling, literally millions of gallons per day. 

If you know anything about the water wars between GA,  TN, AL, and FLA, then you know states already fight each other over water supply. Counties fight each other over water supply and sue each other over PFAS/PFOS and other impacts. 

Just wait and see how bad lawsuits will become when counties are competing for data centers, in order to get rid of county property taxes, and the unintended results is new data centers that steal the water from surrounding homes and neighboring counties and states. 

Competing with China does not mean become like China by threatening state rights, replacing human jobs on mass scale creating mass poverty, and creating potentially devastating effects on our environment and critical water supply.

This needs a careful and wise approach. The AI EO takes the opposite.",en,Tweet,297,5192,1220,878,198962,2025-07-24 16:09:33,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

The American people hardly have any idea what it is, what it means, and what passed.

1. GENUIS ACT - I voted NO. It passed the Senate and the House and will be signed into law today. 
This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor Centralized Bank Digital Currency. The Federal Reserve has been planning a CBDC for years and this will open the door to move you to a cashless society and into digital currency that can be weaponized against you by an authoritarian government controlling your ability to buy and sell. Do you actually trust your government to never do that to you? I don’t.

2. Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act - I voted YES. This bill passed the House but we were told all week that it will not pass the Senate because the Senate does not have any path at all to get 60 votes to ban a CBDC. This bill prohibits Federal Reserve Banks from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency. It’s a good bill and protects your money, but will die in the Senate. However, this should be people’s highest demand.

3. Clarity Act - I voted YES for self custody protections. This bill passed the House and will likely get some changes in the Senate then have come back to the House for another vote before it can be signed by the President and become law. This bill establishes a detailed regulatory framework for digital assets and allocates authority between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The bill as written does not expressly ban a CBDC and does not protect self-custody. Self-custody means that you control your own money, not a third party.

On Jan 23rd, President Trump signed an executive order on digital financial technology with two important clauses:

1. People will maintain self-custody of digital assets.
2. Banning agencies from establishing a CBDC in the U.S. or abroad.

'1942709412088390072',"🚨🚨🚨Amendment announcement for Defense appropriations funding bill with a sprinkle of a slight rant and sarcasm delivered on a bed of raw truth:

I’m introducing amendments to the Department of Defense appropriations bill that cost $831.5 billion to prohibit funding for 
-$500 million for Israel
-$500 million for Taiwan Security Initiative
-$500 million for Jordan
-$15 million for HIV prevention educational activities
-approximately $118 million for Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid.

I love our military.
I think Pete Hegseth is doing an amazing job as Secretary of DoD.
We couldn’t have a better President and Commander in Chief.

And I want to vote for the Department of Defense appropriations bill but WITHOUT all the foreign aid!

The U.S. State Department already gives Nuclear armed Israel over $3 Billion every single year. Nuclear armed Israel has nearly decimated Hamas in Gaza all by themselves. And we just successfully bombed Iran’s and wiped out Iran’s nuclear program for Nuclear armed Israel. Nuclear armed Israel’s national debt is under $400 Billion compared to our crippling national debt of $37 TRILLION. Nuclear armed Israel seems to have their defense and debt under control, so the American taxpayers should not be required to give Nuclear armed Israel another $500 million in our U.S. defense bill.

Jordan gets around $1.6 Billion from the U.S. State Department every year, why do we have to give them another $500 Million?

Taiwan gets $300 Million from the U.S. State Department every year, and received an additional $2 Billion was in the foreign aid supplemental passed last year. I think the American people can keep that $500 Million.

And I’m sorry and no offense to anyone, but the American people should not be spending $15 Million for HIV prevention educational activities in African nations. If everyone doesn’t know the activities they need to stop doing to prevent getting AIDS by now, well I don’t know what to tell you. Mainly, it’s not America’s financial responsibility to do that and the people getting rich off this need to get funding elsewhere. Call the rich philanthropists! The American people are broke!

And the same goes for the $118 million for Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid. What foreign country showed up to America and said here’s millions of dollars for GA/TN/NC after Hurricane Helene? What about after CA wildfires wiped out so many homes? Lahaina, did they get a foreign aid check? And not a peep from all our great foreign friends trying to throw money at us for the devastated families in Texas from the July 4th flood.

Over it!! We have a drug and mental health crisis and rent, bills and especially insurance is unaffordable for too many hardworking Americans to be sending extra millions and billions to foreign countries for foreign causes to foreign people.

The American people are kind and generous and can donate privately if they choose but should not be forced to do so!

And the quickest and easiest way to cut spending is to STOP FOREIGN AID!!!

P.S. 
Not giving another additional $500 Million to Nuclear armed Israel will not make us all anti-Semitic. 
Or Isolationist.

P.S.S. 
We don’t have to pay off Jordan with another $500 Million either.

'1940874450322268253',"Today, the House of Representatives delivered a major win for the American people by passing President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), a historic piece of legislation that fulfills President Trump’s America First MAGA Agenda.

The OBBB is about keeping promises — the promises President Trump and every MAGA Republican made to the American people. Today, House Republicans delivered.

The OBBB makes the Trump Tax Cuts permanent, protecting families and small businesses from the largest tax hike in American history. It moves to eliminate the unfair death tax that punishes family farms and generational businesses with double taxation. And it ensures hardworking Americans keep more of what they earn by ending taxes on tips and overtime.

It also secures the border by fully restoring President Trump’s successful immigration policies and funding:

✅ At least 1 million deportations per year

✅ 10,000 new ICE agents

✅ 3,000 new Border Patrol agents

✅ And completing President Trump’s big, beautiful wall

This bill is a win for American families, a win for our economy, and a win for our national security.

I’ve stood with President Trump since Day One, and I was proud to vote YES and help get this bill over the finish line.

'1937856958767276445',"The Senate is making changes to the AI provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Instead of an automatic 10 year moratorium on states to regulate or make laws on AI, they are tying the 10 year AI moratorium to a newly created $500,000,000 broad band account for states.

Mostly red states are the ones with rural areas that don’t have Internet. 

So in other words, if a state takes any money from that account, they automatically put a 10 year moratorium on themselves to regulate or make laws on AI.

With no legislation in Congress to regulate or make laws on AI, why would Republicans do this?

And why would they continue to try to keep this and the One Big Beautiful Bill that delivers President Trump’s agenda?

Why can’t Republicans do separate legislation on AI?

40 state AG’s wrote a letter to Congress against the 10 year AI moratorium on state’s  rights.

'1937844071919165797',"Trump is not a king, he is our elected President, and I support him, even when I occasionally disagree with him.

I’m an American and having my own opinion and the freedom to speak it is the most American way.

MAGA is not a cult, it’s a populist political movement, filled with a wide range of diversity of Americans that desperately wants the government to prioritize the American people, our country, and our problems.

If MAGA can’t hold it together on an occasional disagreement then MAGA will lose its power.

In 2016, we elected Trump because we were disgusted with the establishment, and MAGA has been at war with the establishment ever since. 

But don’t be fooled into believing we have beaten them.

Currently the establishment has wrapped themselves in MAGA like a costume, speaking our language and infiltrating our movement, and is waiting to take back control.

But they can’t yet because we still have our champion, Trump, to rally around and beat the establishment back.

But in just a few years that will no longer be the case. 

That is a harsh reality coming and those are going to be very difficult shoes to fill, which will lead to disappointment for many.

I have always taken a hard stance against America going into foreign wars and regime change and forcing the American military to do it and the American people to pay for it.

To me it’s the most hypocritical thing in the world for America to do while we are $37 trillion in debt, with mountains of problems facing our own people that we never solve, and while Americans on our homeland are not being killed, by the current foreign bad guy, whomever they tell us that is on tv, war after war after war.

And I’ve discovered this hard stance is something that has united Republicans and Democrats from all over the country.

My office is being flooded with phone calls from not only Republicans but also many Democrats thanking me for taking a stand against U.S. involvement in Israel’s war against Iran.

Also I am refusing to vote for the AI moratorium, which would take away states rights to regulate and make laws on AI for 10 years.

This has also been a very unifying issue among the people, Republicans and Democrats, and calls are coming in from both sides supporting my stance.

My point is, both parties are failing the American people in many ways.

And it’s because both political parties always put special interests, foreign countries/wars, and their own grip on power above the American people and the future of our country. 

Moving forward there must be a better way to serve Americans and save our children’s future.

'1936844893655020017',"My thoughts on bombing Iran.

I don’t know anyone in America who has been the victim of a crime or killed by Iran, but I know many people who have been victims of crime committed by criminal illegal aliens or MURDERED by Cartel and Chinese fentanyl/drugs. 

Almost everyone in our country can relate to this fact. 

However America has not dropped bunker busters on the Cartel’s sophisticated drug tunnels, launched tomahawks on massive cartel poisonous drug operations, or gone to war against the cartels international terrorists networks.

Neocon warmongers beat their drums of war and act like Billy badasses going to war in countries most Americans have never seen and can’t find on a map, but never find the courage to go to war against the actual terrorists who actually do kill Americans, invade our land, and make BILLIONS doing it day after day, year after year.

I’m 51 years old. I’m GenX. 

I’ve watched our country go to war in foreign lands for foreign causes on behalf of foreign interests for as long as I can remember. I was in 10th grade when Desert Storm started and my father before me was sent to Vietnam, another senseless foreign war. 

America is $37 TRILLION in debt and all of these foreign wars have cost Americans TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS of dollars that never benefited any American.

American troops have been killed and forever torn apart physically and mentally for regime change, foreign wars, and for military industrial base profits. 

I’m sick of it. 

I can easily say I support nuclear armed Israel’s right to defend themselves and also say at the same time I don’t want to fight or fund nuclear armed Israel’s wars. 

Nor any other country for that matter. 

I’m sick of funding foreign aid and foreign countries and foreign everything. 

I want to fund American interests and issues.

I want GREAT trade deals so American businesses and people can afford goods and be successful.

I want low inflation and low interest rates.

I want American construction, housing, and manufacturing to BOOM.

I want Americans to be rich and have security in their future.

I want my children’s generation to HAVE A GREAT FUTURE!!!

My kids are 22, 25, and 27. 

It pisses me off beyond comprehension that my children’s generation can’t afford to buy a house, can’t afford insurance, and have little hope for their future!!! 

Americans are exhausted by all of this and rightfully so. 

I can also support President Trump and his great administration on many of the great things they are doing while disagreeing on bombing Iran and getting involved in a hot war that Israel started.

That’s not disloyalty. Critical thinking and having my own opinions is the most American thing ever.

Because contrary to what brainwashed Democrat boomers say, Trump is not a king, MAGA is not a cult, and President Trump has surrounded himself with people who once disagreed with him and even ran against him for President.

Also the same Democrats in Congress that are all of sudden clutching their pearls about Trump bombing Iran FULLY SUPPORTED AND VOTED TO FUND Dementia ridden Biden’s proxy war against Russia in Ukraine and stood by Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Hypocrites is all they are and they are just desperately trying to find solid ground to oppose Trump on because so far they’ve failed at grasping anything yet.

Unfortunately the list of fakes are becoming quite long and exposed themselves quickly.

Anyone slobbering for the U.S. to become fully involved in the Israel/Iran war is not America First/MAGA.

Wishing for murder of innocent people is disgusting.

We are sick and tired of foreign wars.  All of them.

And this one will quickly engulf the Middle East, BRICS, and NATO as countries are required to take a side.

Real America First/MAGA wants world peace for all people and doesn’t want our military killed and forever injured physically and mentally. 

We love our U.S. military and love them helping to secure our borders and our cities for the defense of OUR PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY.

They are our friends, spouses, cousins, nieces, nephews, sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters.

We have spent TRILLIONS in the Middle East and we have dealt with the aftermath of death, blown apart bodies, never ending suicides, and disabling PTSD.

All because they told us propaganda as to why we must sacrifice our own to defend some other country’s borders and some other country’s borders.

I don’t want to see Israel bombed or Iran bombed or Gaza bombed.

I don’t want to see Ukraine bombed or Russia bombed.

And we do NOT want to be involved or required to pay for ANY OF IT!!!

We are $36+ TRILLION in debt and have mountains of our own problems.

We have giant planks sticking out of our own eyes while we complain about splinters in other’s eyes.

Every country involved and all over the world can be happy, successful, and rich if we all work together and seek peace and prosperity.

Taking this position is NOT antisemitic.

It’s rational, sane, and loving toward all people.

Taking this position of peace and prosperity for all is not isolationism, it leads to GREAT trade deals and GREAT economies that help ALL PEOPLE.

'1932066259803197777',"Hi David, I think the AI discussion is one of the most important issues we can plan for.
For context of my background and conceptual framework. As a business owner in construction, I am pro business and understand the labor issues and needs better than most.
As a Representative in the U.S. House, I believe protecting federalism is essential, constitutional, and the American way.
Every innovative industry in our country’s history has had to rise under each states ability to regulate and make laws on behalf of their citizens. 
Tying our states hands behind their back for 10 years with a moratorium freezing states ability to regulate and make laws is the opposite of federalism and makes us no different than China with a big government power grab.
Allowing states to regulate and make laws will preserve the state’s abilities to choose their path.
Currently on the federal level, Congress has not developed a federal regulatory plan for AI yet. We would be preemptively destroying federalism for 10 years without a plan.
We know governors and states are ranked on job creation and economic stats.
By protecting federalism, some states will compete to be the most AI friendly and will make decisions to recruit AI tech companies with varieties of incentives.
Other states may choose to be less AI friendly and that’s their right.
My district is a filled with wonderful working class people. 
Many of whom will have their jobs replaced by AI and AI driven robotics. 
I’ve watched Georgia’s rural communities devastated for the last 40 years after manufacturing jobs were sent overseas and once those plants shut down, other jobs were scarce.
This destroyed small towns, their economies, and consequently it destroyed families as well. 
How many human jobs will AI replace over the next 10 years? 
It’s predicted to replace a large swath of human jobs in many areas.
And once AI replaces all of those human jobs, they will not have hardly any jobs to find.
My district has an unemployment rate of 2.9% but after AI job replacement, we could see unemployment rates we’ve never seen before.
This would lead to poverty and homelessness we’ve never seen before.
And with a 10 year moratorium, states would have no way to regulate and make laws to protect people.
The people are who matter to me.
My children in their 20’s and their future children are who matter to me, and all of their generations.
Once many human jobs are replaced, who is paying these unemployed people?
How do they feed their families?
The economy will collapse.
And when they are no longer paying federal and state taxes because they can’t, how will that affect government funding?
The future is unknown and I believe in order to best lookout for people I’ve sworn an oath to serve, I must defend federalism.
Besides this AI clause in the One Big Beautiful Bill doesn’t belong in the bill. That bill is supposed to be the president’s campaign promises, which are taxes, energy, and very much needed border security and deportations. 
Poison pills kill great bills.
Republicans must address AI separately with sincere diligent efforts instead of the typical tricks of shoving a 19 year federalism moratorium in a big thousand page bill.

The Senate needs to pull the section in the OBBB that destroys federalism for 10 YEARS to allow AI to run rampant!!!

40 state Attorney Generals wrote a letter demanding the UNPRECEDENTED federal power grab be removed from the One Big Beautiful Bill!

40 State AGs!!!!

Notably missing is GAs AG Chris Carr. Fatal mistake for a Republican governor candidate by the way! 

AI is going to replace mass amounts of human jobs in nearly every job sector over the next 10 years, which will lead to massive unemployment and that leads to poverty!

And ultimately death because there will be no other jobs to find.  How do you keep a roof over your head and feed your family without a paycheck???  You can’t!!!!!

This will make the last 40 years of losing manufacturing jobs to foreign countries look like nothing as unemployment rates will reach levels never seen before in U.S. history.

States must have the right to be either wide open AI friendly, recruiting AI tech companies to their states or AI shut - defending human rights, jobs, and safety from an AI and robotic takeover or somewhere in between!!!

Americans must be allowed to choose which state they want to live in, in the future, as AI changes everything and the federal government has NO RIGHT to force every state to be compliant and the same!!!

Otherwise we are NOT FREE AT ALL!!! 

Brett Guthrie, Chair of E&C, apologized to me yesterday for not briefing us on this little section in the over thousand page bill, about what the AI lobby is pushing for in order to compete with China. 

By the way, if you want to compete with China then do it in our American framework that supports how our country was founded which is on federalism-supporting state rights and not big federal power.  Otherwise, America is NO DIFFERENT than China!!!

The One Big Beautiful Bill is supposed to be about delivering President Trump’s campaign promises on taxes, America First energy, and sweeping border security, NOT destroying state rights for the AI industry or the NY SALT caucus lining their rich Democrat states pockets or anyone else’s pet projects. 

Stop hijacking the bill!!!

By the way, ZERO Conservatives were warning about this before the bill was passed!!! Why not??? Either they didn’t know or they were fine with it!!!  But they can’t lie either way!

And if America wants to defeat China, stop sending our meat to be processed there.

Stop depending on China for our medications.

China has killed too many Americans by sending deadly fentanyl into the U.S. by the cartels. 

Make ALL of our food and critical chain supply in the USA and stop depending on China at all!!!

Didn’t you learn anything from Covid? And now two Chinese agents snuck another biological weapon into Michigan.

STOP dealing with China and PUT AMERICA FIRST!!!

Do I love the price tag?
NO. 
But I want OUR policies funded.

I campaigned across the country for YEARS with Trump, more than any member of Congress, and the man NEVER said he would destroy state rights for 10 years to let AI tech companies run rampant!!!

TAKE IT OUT OR I’M VOTING NO WHEN IT COMES BACK TO THE HOUSE!!!!!

And lastly, our debt crisis is OUT OF CONTROL.  The interest is growing now at $1 trillion per year and getting bigger.

'1927449199165014319',"The climate change hoax and Green New Deal Scam has created many unnecessary regulations that are having far reaching effects still to this day.

For example, currently there is a massive need for a new refrigerant forced on the HVAC industry because of climate hoax lies.

R-410A which has been an incredibly reliable and inexpensive refrigerant is being phased out and R-454B is the new refrigerant that everyone has to buy, but can barely find.

The shortage and supply of R-454B is driving the cost as high as $1,000 dollars for a 20 pound jug compared to  an avg cost of $300 for a 25 pound jug of R-410A.

In other words, the Biden administration and climate hoaxers were able to pass regulations with the Green New Deal that will now drive the cost of your air conditioning and may lead to you getting bad news from the repair man that won’t be able to provide the refrigerant you need immediately in the high heat this summer. 

Oh, and by the way, the new refrigerant, R-454B is flammable.

'1924079387848179732',"There is a lot of confusion about the big beautiful bill and understandably so.

If I had it my way, Congress would be forced to pass a balanced budget every single year and if we didn’t then we would not be eligible for re-election!

But clearly I don’t have it my way because Congress is a majority ruled legislature.

The big beautiful bill is a special type of budget called reconciliation that can pass the House by majority and Senate, meaning that it can pass in the Senate with 51 votes and not have to stand up under the 60 vote rule. And there are a lot of rules about what can go in and what can’t go in this reconciliation budget bill. I don’t make the rules. I’m just explaining it so that hopefully it helps you understand why it doesn’t contain things that I want passed immediately and should’ve been done already in the House and the Senate like the very important DOGE cuts.

So we have three types of legislation that we can pass in the House that passes President Trump‘s agenda. 

1. The reconciliation bill that Trump wants and named The Big Beautiful Bill. This is essentially an omnibus that prioritizes spending on border security, energy, and the tax bill. This will fund the federal government and prioritize spending to match policies that the Trump administration is asking the House and Senate to pass. It is going to be expensive and the White House is working closely with the House and Senate on what is in this bill. This is not a federal reduction bill, it’s a federal funding bill. If we don’t pass this, the tax law will expire and taxes will be increased by 65% on most Americans. It also funds two of our top priorities - border security and deportations and American energy and destroying the Green New Deal. Again don’t shoot the messenger, I’m just explaining it to you and not sugar coating it.

2. DOGE cuts also called rescissions. These can be passed separately or in one big package. Personally, I would like to be passing them every single week. I don’t know why we can’t pass DOGE cuts like defunding studies of the sex lives of shrimp each week. I think DOGE cuts are extremely important because this is how we reduce the size and scope of the behemoth, the federal government. 

3. President Trump’s Executive Orders. The House and the Senate can vote to pass legislation that would codify into law President Trump‘s executive orders. He has now signed over 150 EOs. I would love to see all 150+ past. But if I were you, I wouldn’t get your hopes up that that will happen because after all this is Washington DC that never really does the well of the people. Sadly, and I’m just being honest not that I support that. I support doing the will of the people.

Here is what I am being told between the House and the White House. 

They told me that once we finish with reconciliation, President Trump‘s big beautiful bill, that we will be passing DOGE cuts. OMB is going to send a rescission package to House Appropriations Committee. Again, I would like to be doing them every single week, but they are planning to do them in a package as far as I have been told.

Also, they told me that the executive orders will come through House committees. I don’t have details on the timing of that but will try to find out. 

Lastly, getting 218 Republicans to vote together is like herding cats. And it’s a lot more complicated when the Republicans, who never supported President Trump until the very end of the campaign when they had to because he was beating everyone, are all standing on their own little hills in their own little castles defending their own little kingdoms instead of fighting together.

And when spending bills are over spending instead of being a balanced budget a little bit over spending is the same as being a little bit pregnant. The reality is over spending is over spending. If there was a real fight for a balanced budget I would be leading it, and it would be worth it.

Until then, DOGE cuts!",en,Tweet,461,11069,2777,1900,249925,2025-05-18 13:27:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Lawler can win re-election on that and the $30,000 SALT caps is even better than the measly $20,000 SALT cap he put in his own legislation.

Then we have the other wing of our conference who just voted NO in the budget committee mark up on the reconciliation budget.  

The Freedom Caucus now refuses to vote for the bid beautiful bill because it doesn’t cut Medicaid enough.

This group, Clyde, Roy, Norman, and Brecheen are all in nice red seats and I think they are screwing things up just as badly as RINO Mike Lawler.

I would argue that it is all of them that don’t appreciate our majority like I do!

I just want to pass the big beautiful bill, Trump’s EOs, and DOGE rescission cuts and win, win, win!!

Then we can do another reconciliation bill and hopefully get another bite at the apple to win some more!

Lawler, Clyde, Norman, Roy, and Brecheen never supported Trump until the end of the election cycle until they had no choice.  They never went to rally after rally all over the country like I did, and I went to more than anyone fighting to win.  These guys have no idea what made millions of people stand in lines for hours, give Trump standing ovations, and hold their hand over their hearts and cry.  

But I do.

Because I was there with them.

It wasn’t SALT caps or Medicaid cuts. 

It was NO tax on tips, overtime, social security, closing the border and stopping innocent American’s like Laken Rileys from being murdered, lowering inflation to make life affordable for the average American who can no longer afford it, ending the never ending foreign wars, and Making America Healthy Again.  It was MAGA and America First.

So when I am attacking these guys for dying on their own hills where they have built their mini kingdoms, I am doing it for a reason.

A $2 million dollar house in Lawler’s district is going to have property taxes around $30,000+ per year, so the $30,000 SALT cap would allow them to deduct their entire property taxes off their federal taxes if they make under $400,000 per year!!!

Because they’d rather honor a foreign country run by drug cartels than stand up for the American people.

The Gulf isn’t secured by Mexico. It’s defended by the United States Coast Guard and Navy. Every year, tens of thousands of pounds of deadly drugs including cocaine, fentanyl, meth, and heroin, are trafficked through the Gulf and smuggled into our communities.

Since January 20, 2025, the U.S. Coast Guard has seized over 100,000 pounds of cocaine and over 10,000 pounds of marijuana, much of it trafficked through these waters.

Democrat policies have fueled this crisis. They opened our borders, defunded border enforcement, and prioritized illegal aliens and MS-13 gang members over American families. These same Democrats are now outraged over the idea of renaming a body of water that we protect, we patrol, and we pay for.

'1918675349837103379',"I gave my vote for a Biden/Democrat funding and policy CR once because my President asked me to, but I will not do it again.

Going forward, earning my vote for funding and policies will be defined by these issues:

1. I will not vote to fund a single penny or bullet to Ukraine regardless of a useless mineral deal that the American people do not care about or want. 
Write the several hundred billion off as a loss instead of permanently injecting ourselves into a never ending blank check and geopolitical disaster that the American people do not support or even care about. Haven’t enough been slaughtered? Let’s mine our own rare Earth resources, we are rich either them, and create American jobs.

And add Iran. Let the countries in that region of the world deal with them as they choose. Not America, we have an enemy that has literally been murdering, raping, and stealing from Americans for years. I’ve never seen a Houthi, but I’ve seen and heard the horror and heartbreak from American families about their family members murdered by the Cartel’s crimes and drugs.

If we can post on social media that we are going to bomb Iran, why would we hesitate or ask permission from Mexico to take out the organizations that enrich themselves by tens of billions every year by murder, rape, drug trafficking, and human and child sex trafficking? 

2. I will not vote to fund a CDC that keeps the failed and dangerous mRNA Covid vaccines on the childhood vaccine schedule. Aren’t children being injected with enough poisons? Why does this continue? 

3. I will not vote to fund reconciliation and tax law that raises taxes on hard working small business owners and does not include the President’s tax campaign promises of NO tax on tips, overtime, and social security. For the love of God, give the American people and those who have suffered and worked the hardest a break. 

4. Make the DOGE cuts permanent. This is one of the most important patriotic efforts to gut the bloated and failing federal government of extreme and outrageous corruption, fraud, waste, and putrid spending. 

5. I will not vote for a single penny to fund any thing that is involved in the trans agenda and child abusive medical industry that lies to children about their gender and sexuality and performs any level of sex changes on minors. There are only two genders, male and female, created in the image of GOD. We must stop this evil.

6. No federal funding for abortion and any entity involved in organ harvesting of dead and murdered babies. Period.

'1918351681374581181',"I represent the base and when I’m frustrated and upset over the direction of things, you better be clear, the base is not happy. 

I campaigned for no more foreign wars.

And now we are supposedly on the verge of going to war with Iran.

I don’t think we should be bombing foreign countries on behalf of other foreign countries especially when they have their own nuclear weapons and massive military strength. 

And on top of that, now we are told that we have signed a deal for mineral rights in Ukraine, in order to pay us back for the hundreds of billions of dollars that we gave Ukraine and they used for money laundering, sold the weapons we gave them to our enemies, and their leader is a dictator who canceled elections, was involved of the first impeachment of Trump, and campaigned for Biden.

Didn’t we learn our lesson when we went to war in Iraq and killed Saddam Hussein because of “weapons of mass destruction?”
Did we ever find any? And did any of that oil over in the Middle East make us rich? The answer is no, we are $36 trillion in debt today. 

So why on earth would we go over and occupy Ukraine and spend an untold amount of future American taxpayer dollars defending and mining their minerals as well as potentially putting American lives at risk and future war?

Why don’t we just mine our own rare earth minerals that are tied up on federal lands that the government confiscated years ago? 

I also campaigned on accountability for the communist and tyrannical acts made by the government during Covid. Yet the Covid vaccine still has FDA approval even though there are millions reported injuries and deaths, and this mRNA vaccine is known to have horrific side effects and DOES NOT STOP PEOPLE FROM CATCHING COVID.
And to this day, it’s still on the childhood vaccine schedule, why on earth is this happening? Hasn’t big pharma made enough billions and billions and billions of dollars on this lie?

I also campaigned on accountability for all the law fair that was waged against the American people in the past four years. What about all the people that were locked up in jail and the abuse that they went through? And when are those vicious attorneys and judges ever going to be held accountable for the lives they ruined?

And I campaigned for an end to waste fraud and abuse of the American people’s harder tax dollars. I believe the DOGE mission is one of the most important things happening today in our government, and yet where are the rescissions that we should be voting on in Congress? 

And one of the biggest issues in the nation that I have fought for, and early on I was one of the only ones that took a loud screaming stand against, is the evil transgender assault against our children.  Most normal people in this country can’t even comprehend how it’s allowed to happen to kids who by law can’t even get a tattoo, drive, or vote. And how did so many of our teachers turn into the predators themselves that groom children with gender lies? This should be an all out effort by Republicans to end this insanity.

And look at the extreme nature of our rogue judicial system that is so defiant that there are judges that defy our nation’s laws and block the deportation of literal enemies of the United States of America. Where is the outrage and moral courage to dispose of this treason? Sadly not in Congress.

And what about election integrity? This should be the most important issue that the Republicans aggressively fight to protect because without secure elections protected from illegals voting and protections from stealing our votes, the American people have lost their power.

Nancy Pelosi was a machine.

But he had no other option to get behind either because Congress gave him none.

Weekly, we should be passing rescissions with ease cutting Biden era spending, policies and fraud that DOGE has uncovered, as these only require 51 votes in the Senate not 60.

AOC doesn’t challenge her party’s leadership, she serves in obedience to it.

She fell in line hard the past 4 years voting to fund foreign war, job killing green new scam policies hurting workers, and the little progressive that once held a protest outside Speaker Pelosi’s office turned into a little yes girl to everything mainstream Democrat.

And Bernie Sanders is a joke.

Hillary Clinton literally stole the election from him and everyone knew it including him and then he turned and obediently endorsed her as the Democrat nominee for President, losing all trust and respect of his supporters who wanted to challenge the Democrat party status quo. 

The people attending their little fundraising grift tour events are the same massive crowds that went to Kamala rallies and we all saw how the election turned out after that.

'1908149254276677794',"Poor Anna, you are being used by the Democrats to bring back proxy voting when you are clearly, in your own words, against people receiving taxpayer funded paychecks working from home.

In the 117th Congress (you weren’t with us yet because you had lost your election) Speaker Pelosi allowed proxy voting.

And it became the Democrats greatest tool to accomplish their agenda.

Many of the Democrats stayed home, proxy voted, and handed their voting cards over to Democrat leadership which allowed them to ram through their destructive Democrat agenda and by simply casting all the votes they needed to do it because they had the majority.

And it’s incredibly naive to believe your Democrat friends that proxy voting will only be kept to maternity leave.

This is Pandora’s box and members of Congress will want more reasons to proxy vote like sick leave, family occasions, and on and on. 

They already talk about it!

Serving in Congress is a privilege, not a career choice. 

If you need a job with better perks like maternity leave then step down and allow someone else to serve in your place.

Having children and prioritizing them over politics is certainly respectable and worthy. 

But you should not be fighting 96% of Republicans, your own party, to change the way Congress has worked from our founding.

China, who steals our technology and was a third world country until America shipped its manufacturing there, charges tariffs on U.S. products at a whopping 67%, Trump only gave China 34%!

The European Union, who would all be speaking German today if we had not gotten involved in WWI & WWII, charges America 39%, Trump only gave them 20%!

Vietnam, where many Americans died after being drafted to war, charges America 90%, Trump only gave them 46%!

India charges America 52%, but Trump only gave them 26%! 

And it goes on and on. However most countries Pres Trump only imposed 10% tariffs.

Yes.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg recently ordered that deportation flights carrying Venezuelan gang members—criminals responsible for the deaths of American citizens—be turned around mid-flight.

This ruling is not just an affront to the millions of Americans who support President Trump’s mission to secure our country, it is entirely nonjusticiable.

President Trump is our Commander-in-Chief and was exercising the powers fully vested in him by Article II of the Constitution. No judge at any level, including the Supreme Court, can limit the constitutional powers granted to the President.

Issuing such a weaponized, politically motivated judgment in bad faith undermines the credibility of our entire judicial system and demands immediate action from Article I to defend and uphold Article II.

Impeachment and removal from office is the constitutionally prescribed remedy, and it is urgently needed.

Unfortunately, Judge Boasberg is not alone. Other judges have similarly issued political rulings designed to undercut President Trump and his administration.

No single District Court judge in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, or anywhere else has more authority than the Presidency.

That’s why I’ve co-sponsored Articles of Impeachment against five federal judges so far. 

I’m also in support of legislative options to reign in rogue judges trying to play President. 

However, the easiest way to stop these rogue judges is for Congress to do our job and pass our own budget and policies through one big beautiful bill just like President Trump has asked us to.

But we in Congress now have to deliver as well.

With the historic election. You would think Republicans would just whip up our bills, budget, and approps and pass them with ease, but nope, it’s so much harder than it should be.

President Trump wants one big beautiful bill and I prefer one as well, but we have to make sure HIS agenda is in that one big beautiful bill and there are a few items that some of my conservative colleagues don’t support. (Conservative doesn’t mean they supported Trump until they had to)

No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, and No Tax on Social Security were President Trump’s big campaign promises and some conservatives don’t want to include those when we renew the tax law - Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 

Those tax campaign promises help many Americans that need it the most as they have been hit hard by Biden and the Democrat’s high inflation over the past 4 years.  We are talking about senior’s and workers. 

So why, you ask, would some conservatives not support no tax on tips, overtime, and social security???

It’s because they are singularly focused on deeply cutting spending and some of them never supported Trump in the first place so they have no respect for the people’s mandate. Some of them simply don’t get it. And some of them think overly highly of themselves and their own plan.

Here is what they are missing, as well as some others in our Republican conference. 

With spending cuts, DOGE cuts, Trump’s de-regs, Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, energy policies, we MUST renew TCJA WITH all of the no tax campaign promises because ALL OF THIS together will be like Elon’s rockets to our economy!!!

And it all will work together to drive revenue AND cut spending AND will deliver the mandate THE PEOPLE voted for!!!

Cutting spending is only one piece and believe me I’m all for it, but with our compounding interest now bigger than our military budget, we can’t cut our way out of this.

We have to increase revenue but not be so blind and stupid that we give tax breaks to corporations but NOT to desperately suffering workers and seniors!!!

Give money back to workers and seniors and they will spend it into the economy and will be thanking Republicans at the same time!!!

Increasing revenue will happen through reciprocal tariffs, killing the green new deal handouts and tax breaks and driving American energy (which will lower business cost and inflation), cutting the strangling regulations on businesses, and DOGE’s lethal attack on the deep state’s money laundering and fraud.

But for the love of God, help the people that need it most, get out of your own way, deliver TRUMP’S agenda, and maybe just maybe we will win the midterms if we do this right.",en,Tweet,300,14193,3978,2101,278357,2025-02-20 12:47:58,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1891624940169760982',"Based on your comments which I fully appreciate and don’t disagree with, I’ll share more information about serving in Congress.
For the yellow weeks, when we are in session, we have to fly into DC from our districts so that is a full travel day for many of us.
The last day of the week we fly back home to our districts, another full travel day. At least for those of us who don’t live in Washington. I do not live in Washington DC, I live in my district.
When we are not in session, we are either working at our district offices, meeting with constituents in our districts, or traveling. 
Most of us also have families that we don’t get to spend enough time with.
We also have to afford two homes, one in DC and one in our districts. Unlike some, I don’t sleep in my office. 
We are Representatives and our constituent services work is what you don’t see on tv and takes place back in our districts, but is actually some of most important work we do.
Lastly, we in the House don’t vote on President Trump’s nominations. The Senate only confirms nominations.
If I could change anything, I would require Congress to pass a balanced budget every year or not be qualified to run for re-election. 
For example, if the 119th Congress can’t balance the budget, then the entire Congress gets replaced the next election.

Here is why. 👇

An average of 300 Americans are murdered every single day from fentanyl that comes directly from China into Mexico and Canada then the Mexican cartels smuggle it into America through both borders.

Yes there are Mexican cartels operating in Canada now.

Canada and Mexico have not stopped the multi billion dollar Mexican cartels from the intense flow of human trafficking and drug trafficking across our southern border and northern border and China has not stopped sending poisonous fentanyl to the Mexican cartels to murder our people.

And it’s not just fentanyl, the horrifying effects of drug and human trafficking are the decay of our society, and Americans have been forced to pay for it all by our inept leaders. 

Shame on the governments of Canada, Mexico, and China for what they have done to America.

While trade accounts for 67% of Canada’s GDP, 73% of Mexico’s GDP, and 37%
of China’s GDP, it accounts for only 24% of U.S. GDP. However, in 2023 the U.S.
trade deficit in goods was the world’s largest at over $1 trillion.

'1884579123470757912',"Good morning.

After two days at our House Republican winter retreat, we still do not have a plan on budget reconciliation and our Speaker and his team have not offered one.

Not even if we are in a one bill or two bill framework, even though President Trump (who prefers one big beautiful bill) literally told us here at the start of our conference that he now does not care if it’s one or two.

Basically, just get started doing something.

We have only been presented with the same policy and budget cut proposals that we have been presented with for a month now at all our meetings and at a full Saturday conference meeting earlier this month.

I would say sink or swim, but our country is already sinking, so we MUST swim.

President Trump is leading the charge with unprecedented America FIRST executive orders. 

We should be writing our bills and budget reconciliation word for word to his executive orders so that they can become law and not stopped with Democrat lawsuits that are already piling up or a future Democrat administration that undoes them all with a stroke of the pen.

The American people elected Trump and are THRILLED with his executive orders and aggressive leadership that fights for America, and they want the entire Republican Party to DO THE SAME.

The American people demand Republicans deliver on the mandate and we should not be concerned about what CBO, who is left leaning and gets it wrong all the time, says. We should care what the people say and they don’t care what CBO says. 

And don’t worry, tax dollars did not pay for our conference retreat, we had to pay for it ourselves.

I would normally complain about spending money that didn’t accomplish anything, but we stayed at Trump Doral, which is a phenomenal resort, and the weather was sunny and in the 70’s.  And the Congressional Institute did a good job as always. 

Now the flag is at full mast.

I very much want House Republicans to be successful, all of us, with our razor thin majority.

Next time we meet, I hope to know a framework of our plan and I hope this doesn’t turn into another bill with thousands of pages dumped on us with less than 72 hours to read it all before we have to vote on the eve of another government shutdown.

But why would I expect different?",en,Tweet,95,7320,1744,1390,222376,2025-01-29 12:27:31,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GidetOEW0AEh1Ms.jpg

President Trump was elected with a mandate, and Republicans in Congress must rapidly work towards fulfilling that mandate.

D.O.G.E. is a vital part of President Trump's mandate, and my brand-new subcommittee will work hand-in-hand with President Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and their entire team to create a government that actually works for the American people.

Waste, fraud, mismanagement, and abuse plague the federal government everywhere, from the Social Security Administration to local post offices serving Northwest Georgians.

Government doesn’t have to run this way.

If something as appalling as employees not showing up to work is unacceptable in the private sector, why should it be allowed in government?

YOU, the American taxpayer, pay for the paychecks of every federal employee, including mine.

Everything we do should serve the American people because you are our bosses.

That’s why I’m committed to making our government more efficient, effective, transparent, and accountable to every American.

I will never forget it.

And I can’t describe my frustrations for the past several years, as it’s been impossible to stop the politically weaponized DOJ and even worse knowing how many members of congress don’t care about J6’ers.

They protested an election.

On one day for a few hours.

BLM and Antifa burned cities, attacked police, federal courthouses, burned 93 police cars, dozens of people were killed, and their “protest” destroyed over $2 billion in property in cities all over America, and it was every night for an entire summer. 

And over 95% of their charges were dropped as they had the full backing and support of the Democrat party and media.

'1872665199490076875',"Good gracious, I came out of Christmas bliss to see arguments about American labor vs H1-B imported labor and MAGA split over this issue.

Good, that means everyone is engaged in saving this country.

Here is some tough reality for some of you:

There are some big MAGA voices with large social media platforms throwing down their opinions yet they have never run a company that relies on thousands of skilled/highly trained workers with a constant need for reliable labor yet they claim authority over the subject matter.

When you spend years trying to constantly hire/train/maintain a good reliable workforce, which is a 24/7 never ending cycle, your real world experience will produce an opinion based on reality and all of your followers on X don’t translate to this.

Having owned a construction company for decades (yes I’m that old), I know firsthand our workforce issues.

However, I fully believe we must make the hard and necessary changes here in the U.S. to educate, build, and facilitate a solid foundation of knowledgeable, highly skilled, talented, well paid, AMERICAN workers. 

Not having this is like having a crumbling foundation in our house and currently we are importing foreigners to hold up the foundation walls and plug the leaks. 

Too many of our young people, are killing their bodies and minds on alcohol and drugs, wasting years and money earning useless college degrees, chasing unrealistic dreams, spending all their time trying to be the next you tuber/content creator/social media influencer instead of pursuing a useful skill set/trade/education in order to become a part of our much needed American workforce. 

If you fall in this category, put down the selfie light, and go apply for a job and replace the H1-B visa holders and all the other skilled labor jobs that foreign workers are taking and American companies are desperately trying to hire.

It’s called building a career, you work your way up.

In order to go forward we must change our education system, create a culture that respects hard work and productivity, cut government waste/spending/regulations in order to produce a healthy robust economy that lowers inflation and pays higher wages to an American workforce, so that H1-B is no longer needed and can be done away with.

Decades of America LAST bad decisions in Washington wove a giant web of America LAST policies that created systems and structures that must be torn down and rebuilt to put America FIRST.

This requires everyone’s help to change it and we will all have to do what it takes to get it done.

It won’t be easy and it won’t be as quick as we like, but we can do it TOGETHER and the results will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN but EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE!!!",en,Tweet,2375,38380,6341,8381,4000040,2024-12-27 15:25:50,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1870093454421684550',"I am one of the most conservative members of Congress and last night I voted for a bill that ordinarily I would never vote for.

However, the man that took a bullet to the face and won the presidential election with 312 electoral college votes, and the most votes of any Republican presidential candidate in history asked me to vote for it, so I did, gladly.

After Johnson completely failed us by not including us in the planning of this year end’s government funding and then dumped a 1,500 page CRomnibus on us Tuesday night with little time to read it and got caught, in his scheme with Schumer, McConnell, and Hakeem, by all the great American people here on X along with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, it was President Trump‘s team, our incoming Vice President JD Vance, and then President Trump himself that dove in, in the midnight hour, and came up with a CR that solves the debt ceiling problem for President Trump, and even more importantly, helped hurricane victims, farmers, and would keep the government open.

They shouldn’t have had to do that but they did.

After that CR failed last night, I can assure you nothing good is coming behind it.

But what is worse in my opinion is that we gave up a critical opportunity to unite and pass our own CR sending it to Senate with a powerful message to Schumer and the Dems that come hell or high water we are going to deliver for Pres Trump and the people who elected him.

Johnson doesn’t understand the mandate.

The American people fired the Democrats, so what they want is irrelevant, and Democrats really need to take that into account.

Democrats need to stop blaming Elon Musk and take a hard look in the mirror and realize their pork in the bill outraged the American people.

Johnson needs to stop the same failed pattern making dirty swamp deals behind closed doors and keeping everyone in the dark. 

Republicans need to be working together to deliver the mandate.

However, it was the American people engaging and posting their outrage on X that killed the bill.

But they hate Elon because he bought X and protected free speech, which allowed the people to fight back and stop another Uniparty shit sandwich.

The truth is they hate you, the people, for standing up to them.

They are angry they got caught in such a big way.

They own it. They can’t blame anyone but themselves. 

Now it must be broken in order to fix it.

And the messy consequences sit squarely on the Uniparty’s shoulders.

No communication, planning, or conference meetings have been called.

I don’t know another Republican member who gave any input into the 1,500+ page CRomnibus bill.

We did not know what was in the text until the bill was released last night. 

I am very grateful to all the Americans who dove into reading the bill text along with Elon and Vivek and made their voices heard!

If you all keep reading all our bills, with your support and pressure, we can save our country! So thank you 🙏 

To be clear, the 1,500+ pages released last night were added spending items on top of the CR (continuing resolution) of the 2023 two part omnibus. 

A clean 3 month CR would extend the policies and programs funded in the two part 2023 omnibus which totaled $1.66 trillion. So that CR (1/4 of total) would cost approx $415 billion.

Then you would have to add on the extra cost of the items in the 1,500 page bill from last night. We don’t know how much that is!

So I can’t even tell you what the full cost of that proposed CRomnibus would be! 

In my opinion, the Americans that need help are the victims of natural disasters like Hurricane Helene and our farmers. 

And those relief packages should go to the floor separately asap. 

We work for the American people, we should help the American people.

They should not be used as trading pawns between Republicans and Democrats to get what each side wants.

Joe did not pardon Hunter because he is a father who loved his son like the mockingbird media and Democrat liars are saying.

Joe pardoned Hunter all the way back to 2014 when Hunter started bio labs in Ukraine, started with Burisma, and began money laundering through dozens of LLC shell companies through business deals in many foreign countries including China.

Hunter is not just Joe’s son, he is his business partner, and Hunter sold his Dad’s power and influence for millions while Joe was VP and beyond. 

That’s why the wide sweeping pardon from 2014 to now.

Matthew Perna was a non violent J6 defendant who tragically committed suicide under the unbearable weight of political persecution by U.S. attorney Matthew Graves from the DOJ.

Matthew Perna is not the only J6 defendant who committed suicide, sadly there are more.

I introduced the Matthew Perna Act, after Congressman Louie Ghomert left in order to stop political persecution in the justice system. There are no cosponsors. It is a good bill that should have bipartisan support as it allows protestors to get a fair trial and it was written by Louie Ghomert, who is formerly a judge and understands the justice system better than most.

'1862510100147020276',"The War Machine.. 

I’ll explain how it works and why I don’t vote for it.

The Defense Industrial Base is tax payer funded gov contracts with American companies to build weapons, ammunition, and military equipment - made in America with American jobs.

The pitch they give members of Congress and Senators is that we MUST vote for the annual defense budget and other programs in order to fund America’s military and defense of the United States of America.  

AND they always add how important these gov contracts are with American companies because they create jobs and continued funding protects these jobs.

They will also gladly show each of us a map of where these companies are, and number of jobs, in each of our districts or states, and to increase pressure on us they will throw in where military bases are in our districts.

This is implied understanding of how many votes that we could lose if we don’t vote YES to continue the funding for the defense contracts in our district and the number of military votes we could lose as well if we vote NO to military funding.

Of course add in the shaming of “you don’t support the military?!”

Many appropriation bills contain gov contracts with the defense industrial base which currently is an economic driver created by a business model that is built on murder, war, and destruction in foreign countries around the world.

The reason why I adamantly oppose this business model is because of the way it works.

They give away the older weapons, ammunition, and military equipment to countries the U.S. supports in the name of defending democracy and beating the current bad guy, in order to create the need to sign new defense contracts to build new weapons, ammunition, and military equipment to replenish the old.

Of course, giving away old weapons and equipment to countries like Ukraine comes with U.S. “advisers” on how to use these deadly gifts against their enemies, which also requires more funding. 

This is all in the name of “responsibility.”

This bloody business model creates an annual defense budget of over $850 billion per year, but that’s just the starter package. 

Funding foreign wars like Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, and all the rest actually have cost the American people TRILLIONS of their hard earned tax dollars that comes with the “reasons” of creating American jobs and replenishing America’s military and to support the Military Industrial Economic Base.

When you combine the reality of American tax payers enslaved in debt by paying for murder and war in foreign lands that don’t affect us with stupid decisions by politicians and unelected bureaucrats that led us to $36 trillion in debt which has driven life to be unaffordable, open border policies that have empowered the international criminal cartels trafficking drugs, people, and killing Americans, crumbling infrastructure, dying prosperity and hope for young Americans, and the dumbing down of our youth through failing education and immoral cultural norms, this is why I adamantly OPPOSE and will FIGHT against this evil insanity.

You see when our self righteous government claims to defend freedom and democracy around the world, by regime change with its almighty military forces and strength, boasting about the taxpayer funded Military Industrial Economic Base, while virtually kicking the hard working American people in the gut every damn day making them pay for it all, while simultaneously not defending our own border, the people hate the government and it’s pathetic little shills in the media.

I ran for Congress in 2020 because I was furious the Republicans did not accomplish the agenda we wanted in President Trump’s first presidency.

Now as I serve in the House, resoundingly elected for my third term, I will make sure we get it done this time and even better than before.

There is no way I’m backing down now.

The message to the Republican Party is loud and clear. The people do not support your addiction to foreign wars, failures to accomplish the America First agenda, and Washington swamp ways. The people support Trump and the agenda he campaigned on during this election, not the Republicans. Trump drug everyone across the line. People are sick of it all and will refuse to vote for us next time if we don’t get it done, and rightfully so. 

The Democrats ruined our lives for 4 years and the entire time they lectured us, looked down on us, called us Nazi, fascist, and garbage, and weaponized the government against us.

We impeached Mayorkas in the House (my articles of impeachment) trying to stop this treason against the American people, but the Senate refused to even hold a trial. 

I’ve introduced many articles of impeachment (so have others) but they go nowhere and we conservatives in the House have refused to vote to fund this traitorous government but we don’t have enough to stop it.

The government is funded by THE PEOPLE and is facilitating a deadly invasion into our country.

SUE THE GOVERNMENT!!! 

VOTE!!!

And use the rights given to you by our founding fathers!!!

'1839655979576672730',"🚨🚨🚨There is a strike on the verge of happening Tuesday Oct 1 that could cripple our economy and could leave store shelves bare by shutting down ports that handle 68% of our country’s containerized exports and 56% of containerized imports.

For every single day they strike it could take 6 days to catch up. Meaning just a 5 day strike could take a month to unload and load ships at ports up and down the East coasts and Gulf coasts!

The International Longshoremen's Association, representing 45,000 dockworkers from Maine to Texas at 14 different ports, contracts expire Sept 30th and they are demanding higher wages equal to other dockworker’s pay and guaranteed job security that they will not be replaced by automation and AI.

1977 was the last time they went on strike. That was long before America became dependent on foreign imports for food and necessary goods.

It’s very important to understand how critical this is given that America is now in a $36 billion dollar food trade deficit for the first time in our nation’s history. 

Also, the Biden-Harris administration and Congressional out of control spending has driven inflation so high that many Americans can’t afford quality of life.

I think this situation is serious and could be a crisis going into the election, holidays, and winter depending if they strike and how long it lasts.
