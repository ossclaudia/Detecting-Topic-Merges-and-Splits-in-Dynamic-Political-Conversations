'1966170678446432311',"When I first ran for Congress, my mission was clear: strengthen our border, stand up for our veterans, and be a strong voice for Texas. I’m proud of the real progress we’ve made – putting more eyes and resources on the border, reducing illegal crossings, expanding access to care for our veterans, and making a meaningful difference in the lives of Texans.

But over the July 4th weekend, standing in floodwaters alongside my neighbors, I had a moment of clarity. It reminded me that while the work in Washington is important, my family, my community, and my state need me here – closer to home.

I’m not walking away from service, and I’m certainly not walking away from the fight. I’m choosing a different path – one that allows me to stay rooted in Texas and focus on the people and places that matter most.

Serving Texans in Congress has been the honor of a lifetime, and I will continue to do that until the end of my term. And while I may be stepping back from public office at the end of 2026, I’m not stepping out of the arena. I will continue to champion the values that define our great state: faith, family, and freedom.
