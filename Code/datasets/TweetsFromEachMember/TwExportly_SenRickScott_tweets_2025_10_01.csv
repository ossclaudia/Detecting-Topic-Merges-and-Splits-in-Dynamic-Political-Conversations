'1845600740586213779',"Hoy, me uní al Presidente Joe Biden y a la Administradora de @FEMAespanol, Deanne Criswell, en St. Pete Beach, que fue completamente destruida por el huracán Milton. Como dije después del huracán Helene, si bien agradezco que el presidente y la administradora de FEMA hayan venido a Florida para ver la devastación de primera mano, los floridanos todavía están sufriendo por las tormentas de hace años y el gobierno federal debe estar presente no solo hoy, sino todos los días. La marejada ciclónica no solo causó problemas mayors en la costa, sino que los primeros auxilios siguen realizando misiones de rescate mientras los ríos estan causando inundaciones y tornados destrozan comunidades enteras. Esta tormenta, junto con el huracán Helene, ha derribado a tantas comunidades, pero los floridanos son resilientes. Después del huracán Helene, le dije al Presidente Biden exactamente lo que se necesita para garantizar que Florida tenga todos los recursos federales para recuperarse por completo de esa tormenta y ahora del huracán Milton, lo reiteré en nuestra llamada de la semana pasada y nuevamente hoy. Esto es lo que le enfaticé al presidente: Hago un llamado a Schumer para que el Senado vuelva lo antes posible cuando nuestras comunidades hayan evaluado sus necesidades, lo que le dije al presidente debe acelerarse, para aprobar los fondos necesarios para desastres para FEMA, SBA y el USDA y aprobar un alivio de sentido común como mí Proyecto de ley Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act. El presidente me dijo que estaba de acuerdo conmigo en esto la semana pasada. También debemos asegurarnos de que FEMA abra Centros de Recuperación de Desastres cerca de las áreas más afectadas, para que los afectados tengan fácil acceso a los recursos federales para recuperarse. Finalmente, volví a enfatizar al Presidente Biden la importancia de que el USDA apruebe de inmediato subvenciones en bloque para nuestros agricultores que han estado luchando desde Ian en 2022.

'1845500694305849650',"Today, I joined President Joe Biden and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell on the ground in St. Pete Beach, which was completely destroyed by Hurricane Milton. Like I said following Hurricane Helene, while I appreciate the president and FEMA Administrator coming to Florida to see the devastation firsthand, Floridians are still hurting from storms years ago, and the federal government needs to show up not just today but every day. Not only did storm surge cause significant issues on the coast, but first responders are still conducting non-stop rescue missions as rising rivers cause inland flooding and tornadoes ripped apart entire communities. This storm, along with Hurricane #Helene, has knocked so many communities down, but Floridians are resilient. Following Hurricane Helene, I told President Biden exactly what is needed to ensure Florida has every federal resource to fully recover from that storm and now Hurricane #Milton, I reiterated that in our call last week and again today. Here’s what I stressed to the President: I’m calling on Schumer to bring the Senate back ASAP when our communities have assessed their needs, which I told the president must be expedited, to pass needed disaster funding for FEMA, @SBAgov and the USDA and approve common sense relief like my Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act.

🌀 MAREJADA CICLÓNIC DE HASTA 15 PIES
🌀 SE ESPERAN INUNDACIONES INTENSAS Y CORTES DE ELECTRICIDAD EN TODA LA COSTA DEL GOLFO, EL CENTRO DE FLORIDA Y LA COSTA OESTE
🌀 NO HAY TIEMPO PARA ESPERAR. ES HORA DE PERMANECER EN UN LUGAR SEGURO. MILTON ESTÁ CASI AQUÍ.

🔘 Las comunidades a lo largo de nuestra Costa del Golfo, especialmente las del área de la Bahía de Tampa desde el condado de Hillsborough hasta los condados de Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee y Collier, verán una marejada ciclónica devastadora e insuperable de hasta 15 pies. 

🔘 Se espera que el huracán Milton mantenga su fuerza de huracán a medida que avanza por nuestro estado, provocando inundaciones intensas, lluvias torrenciales y cortes de electricidad no solo en estos condados costeros, sino en todo el centro de Florida y en gran parte de la costa este de Florida. 

🔘 Los servicios de emergencia no pueden salvarte una vez que comiencen los vientos y las condiciones comiencen a deteriorarse. Si no evacuaste y estás dudando, solo tienes una o dos horas para llegar a un refugio, así que SAL AHORA. Como siempre digo, podemos reconstruir una casa, pero no podemos reconstruir una vida.

🌀 INTENSE FLOODING AND WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES ACROSS GULF COAST, CENTRAL FLORIDA & WEST COAST EXPECTED
🌀 NO TIME TO WAIT. GET OUT NOW OR HUNKER DOWN. MILTON IS ALMOST HERE.

🔘 Communities along our Gulf Coast, especially those in the Tampa Bay area from Hillsborough County down through Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee and Collier Counties, will see devastating and unsurvivable storm surge up to 15 feet. 

🔘 Hurricane Milton is expected to retain hurricane strength as it moves across our state, bringing intense flooding, torrential rain, and widespread power outages to not only these coastal counties but across Central Florida and along much of Florida’s east coast. 

🔘 Emergency responders cannot come save you once the winds start and conditions begin to deteriorate. If you did not evacuate and are having second thoughts, you only have an hour or two to get to a shelter, so GET OUT NOW. As I always say, we can rebuild a house, but we cannot rebuild a life.

🌀 GET PREPARED NOW & MANDATORY ZONES EVACUATE 

🌀 MAJOR & MASSIVE HURRICANE

🌀 DEADLY 12+ FEET OF STORM SURGE IN TAMPA AREA

More here ⬇️

🔘  GET PREPARED NOW & MANDATORY ZONES EVACUATE - Floridians still have today and tomorrow to prepare for Milton & you cannot waste time getting ready. You need 7 days of food and water, batteries, medicines, pet food, etc. If under a mandatory evacuation order GET OUT. Milton will kill you if you let it. Be smart, get ready and get to a shelter if you need to. Links to shelters below and evacuation orders below ⬇️

🔘 MAJOR & MASSIVE HURRICANE - Milton is forecast to be a MASSIVE & POWERFUL storm with winds over 115 MPH. Milton will bring deadly storm surge, torrential rain, flooding and power outages to huge portions of our state. It will carry hurricane strength across the state.  Take this seriously!

🔘 DEADLY 12+ FEET OF STORM SURGE IN TAMPA AREA - you cannot survive the storm surge Milton is expected to bring. NHC expects 12+ FEET of surge in Tampa Bay, Sarasota & along the Nature Coast. Up to 10+ FEET further south in SWFL. THIS STORM SURGE WILL KILL YOU. Evacuate if asked to do so.

🌀 MAKE A PLAN NOW

🌀 MAJOR & MASSIVE HURRICANE

🌀 WATCH FOR EVACUATION ORDERS

More here ⬇️

🔘 MAKE A PLAN - the track could shift, but the storm is expected to be BIG. The entire Gulf Coast needs to be ready for landfall on Wednesday and make a plan NOW.

🔘 MAJOR HURRICANE - this is expected to be a massive major hurricane that could bring storm surge, torrential rain, flooding and power outages to huge portions of our state. NHC expects Milton to exit the east coast still at hurricane strength. Central Florida and the First, Space and Treasure Coasts need to take this seriously.

'1841924250598326686',"Si bien agradezco al Presidente Biden, al secretario del USDA, Tom Vilsack, y a los funcionarios de FEMA por haber venido a Florida para ver los daños aquí de primera mano, hay mucho trabajo por hacer. Durante mi reunión con el Presidente Biden, subrayé que la respuesta del gobierno federal a los huracanes durante los últimos dos años ha dejado a demasiados floridanos, especialmente a nuestros agricultores, sufriendo y con necesidades insatisfechas, y esto debe solucionarse AHORA. Se necesitarán esfuerzos locales, estatales y federales para ayudar a las comunidades a recuperarse a lo largo de la Costa del Golfo. Por eso he exigido que el líder de la mayoría Chuck Schumer vuelva a convocar de inmediato al Senado una vez que FEMA y SBA finalicen las evaluaciones de daños para que podamos financiar por completo a estas agencias, al USDA y a otras que responden a este desastre con un proyecto de ley de asignaciones suplementarias para desastres. Lucharé para entregar ayuda a nuestro estado y garantizar una guía de remoción de escombros para nuestras comunidades locales, e insté a los funcionarios federales hoy a que pongan a los floridanos y a todos los estadounidenses de primero. Desde el huracán Ian, Washington ha jugado con los fondos de ayuda para desastres y ha retrasado la entrega de la asistencia urgentemente necesaria de FEMA y otras ayudas como las subvenciones en bloque del USDA para los agricultores de Florida y mi Proyecto de ley Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act. Esta ayuda se ha proporcionado a las víctimas de huracanes en el pasado, pero ese no ha sido el caso desde los huracanes Ian, Debby e Idalia y eso debe cambiar para que podamos entregar esta ayuda AHORA.

“El huracán Helene devastó comunidades a lo largo de cientos de millas de la Costa del Golfo de Florida y causó daños y pérdidas inimaginables en el condado de Taylor y en todo el Big Bend. Desde los días previos a la tormenta, he visitado comunidades afectadas en 11 condados para reunirme con funcionarios locales y estatales y escuchar lo que necesitan del gobierno federal, y he estado en contacto constante con funcionarios estatales y federales para coordinar recursos. Los floridanos son resilientes, pero la recuperación no recae solo en estas familias: es una operación que requiere que el gobierno federal esté presente hoy, mañana y todos los días hasta que el trabajo esté hecho y no dejaré de luchar para asegurarme de que eso suceda.",es,Reply,1,5,2,5,3401,2024-10-03 20:32:17,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
'1841924196802380104',"While I appreciate President Biden, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and officials from FEMA coming to Florida to see the damage here firsthand, there is so much work to be done. During my meeting with President Biden, I stressed that the federal government’s response to hurricanes over the last two years has left too many Floridians, especially our farmers, hurting and with unmet needs – and this must be fixed NOW. It is going to take local, state and federal efforts to help communities recover along the Gulf Coast. That’s why I’ve demanded that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer immediately reconvene the Senate once FEMA and the SBA finalize damage assessments so we can fully fund these agencies, the USDA, and others responding to this disaster with a clean disaster supplemental appropriations bill. I’ll be fighting like hell to deliver disaster aid to our state, and ensure seamless debris removal guidance for our local communities, and I urged the federal officials there today to put Floridians and all Americans first by doing the same. Since Hurricane Ian, Washington has played games with disaster relief funds and delayed the delivery of urgently needed FEMA assistance, and other aid like USDA block grants for Florida’s farmers and my Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act. This aid has been routinely provided to victims of hurricanes in the past but that has not been the case since Hurricanes Ian, Debby and Idalia and that must change so we can deliver this aid NOW.

Hurricane Helene devastated communities along hundreds of miles of Florida’s Gulf Coast and caused unimaginable damage and loss in Taylor County and across the Big Bend. Since the days before the storm, I’ve visited impacted communities in 11 counties to meet with local and state officials and hear what they need from the federal government, and been in constant contact with state and federal officials to coordinate resources.

🔘 Todo Big Bend va a sufrir una marejada ciclónica devastadora y MORTAL de 15 a 20 pies. Más de 10 pies en Apalachicola. Hasta 8 pies en el área de Tampa. No puedes sobrevivir esto. No te arriesgues.

🔘 HURACÁN MAYOR: esta es una tormenta masiva y mortal. Tiene cientos de millas de ancho y cubre todo nuestro estado. Tómatelo en serio. Subestimar a Helene podría costarte la vida.

🔘 EVACUAR AHORA - el momento de actuar es ahora. Si se encuentra en los condados de Taylor, Franklin o Levy, o en cualquier lugar con una orden de evacuación obligatoria, SALGA AHORA. No tiene que ir a horas de distancia. Simplemente vaya al refugio más cercano. Esta es una decisión de vida o muerte. ¡Mantenga a su familia a salvo!
