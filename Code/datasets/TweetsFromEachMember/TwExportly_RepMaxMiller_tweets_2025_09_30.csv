Democrats are trying to mislead the American people about Medicaid reform. President Trump and my Republican colleagues in Congress are working to ensure that Medicaid is sturdy and robust for the people who need it most.

In 2024, the federal government spent an estimated $160 billion on improper Medicaid payments. That’s $1,200 per household! That is simply unsustainable and unacceptable. Medicaid must remain a safety-net program for the people it was intended to serve—low-income children, pregnant women, seniors, and individuals with disabilities.
