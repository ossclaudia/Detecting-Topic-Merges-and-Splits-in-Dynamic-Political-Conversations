'1964446747465306463',"Today, I had the distinct honor of hand-delivering a letter from President @realDonaldTrump to fellow Marine Corps Veteran and local hero, Derrick Perry.

While Derrick doesn’t seek the spotlight, his service and sacrifice embody the very best of our Nation, and he is truly deserving of the recognition.

It was an honor to have breakfast with both he and Katrina and talk about life, the Marine Corps, service, and most importantly - his poise and proactive response against the senseless stabbing at the Traverse City Walmart. 

President Trump said it best:

“There is no doubt that you have maintained your track record of selfless heroism as a Veteran of the United States Marine Corps. The values you learned during your time in the military have certainly translated to your civilian life as you continue to protect and defend the American people.

“Your unwavering leadership has ensured mission success and represented the very best of our great Nation.”",en,Tweet,0,13,1,34,1125,2025-09-06 22:52:56,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0Md5eXXMAARzmx.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0Md5eVW8AAn-e5.jpg"

'1936615975111032978',"Having served 40 years in the Marine Corps — many of those as an aviator — I can say with confidence that today’s U.S. strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran showcased truly impressive precision.

President Trump has long made it clear: Iran must never possess a nuclear weapon — and the American people overwhelmingly agree. The President gave Iran's leader an opportunity to make a deal, but Iran refused to commit to a nuclear disarmament agreement. 

By leveraging the unmatched precision of the U.S. military, the President has sent a clear message to the world about what peace through strength truly means. This was not a knee-jerk response, and knowing President Trump, he has no interest in dragging America into another endless war.

I’ve been saying for years on record, we need to have an exit strategy, a plan for peace, and have accountability for every dollar spent that the U.S. has provided for the Ukrainian conflict with Russia. 

President Zelenskyy has proven multiple times, including today with President Trump, that he views their greatest ally (the United States) as nothing more than a cash cow. It’s important to remember, he treated President Biden this exact same way, but the Biden Administration simply rolled over and played dead.

President Trump understands that there are very few options to find peace in this 1000 year old conflict and 3 year old war. American blood must not be shed in this fight, so all other options must be explored. President Trump and his team negotiated and came up with, what is quite possibly, the only way to stop the bloodshed and fighting at this point.

The warriors of the Ukrainian military have valiantly fought this war for 3 years. I’ve met with them personally and they have shown courage and bravery in the face of evil.
