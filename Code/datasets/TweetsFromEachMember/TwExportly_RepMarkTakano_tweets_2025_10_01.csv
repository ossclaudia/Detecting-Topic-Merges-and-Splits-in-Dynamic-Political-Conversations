Secretary Collins and Chairman Bost have repeatedly assured the public that no veterans’ benefits would be cut in the Administration’s ‘downsizing’ efforts. The decision by VA to remove critical foreclosure assistance that prevents veterans from losing their homes proves that promise was false. Yet another critical VA program has been destroyed by Trump and DOGE.
After increasing unemployment and manipulating the stock market for their own gain, President Trump has left 15,000 veterans using the VASP program in the dark and ended a program that could help nearly 80,000 veterans who are in danger of foreclosure. Veterans and their families rely on the VASP program to avoid housing insecurity and homelessness. Now, Trump and Collins have inexplicably chosen to plunge veterans into further economic crisis.
The VASP program provided relief to veterans in every state who were on the brink of homelessness. The alternative Republicans tout—a so-called ‘partial claim program’— doesn’t exist yet, and even if it did, it wouldn’t help the veterans who are in trouble right now. Ending VASP without a real, functioning alternative in place is reckless and dangerous.
