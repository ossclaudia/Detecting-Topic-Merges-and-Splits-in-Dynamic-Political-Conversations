'1970144464912945159',"It’s been truly moving to witness the countless number of people from across the country come together to honor the life and legacy of Charlie Kirk. Charlie was more than a devoted husband, father, and Conservative activist. He was, above all, a man of deep Christian faith with comprehensive knowledge of the Scripture. He dedicated his life to spreading the message of Christ and empowering the next generation to think for themselves and stand up for their beliefs.

Charlie ignited a movement, inspiring countless young Americans to engage and get involved. That legacy was on full display during Sunday’s powerful memorial in Arizona with people traveling from across the nation to pay their respects and listen to the tributes from Charlie’s pastor, Vice President J.D. Vance, President Trump, and Charlie’s widow, Erika Kirk. Erika’s words, especially her forgiveness of the man who took her husband’s life, were a profound testament to her strength grounded in unshakable faith. Erika will do a great job carrying on Charlie’s mission at Turning Point USA.

Thank you to everyone who has shared kind words and memories of Charlie. His legacy and influence will continue to grow with each passing day.",en,Tweet,1,124,19,18,8768,2025-09-22 16:13:38,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1da6hdWcAAB96i.jpg
