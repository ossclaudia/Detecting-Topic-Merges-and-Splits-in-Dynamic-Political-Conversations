'1958644717656449532',"I was very saddened to hear of the passing of Dr. James Dobson. Dr. Dobson was certainly one of the most influential leaders in America in the last century. Dr. Dobson had a major impact on Ann and me and our children. We first became aware of Dr. Dobson in the mid-1980s at our church through a video series of his lessons on marriage and child rearing. 

Later, in 1989, I was one of a small group of people chosen to participate in a special conference at the Focus on Family headquarters that led to the founding of the Alabama Family Alliance, that later became the Alabama Policy Institute, as part of a national network of family policy councils. In that regard, Dr. Dobson has had a huge impact in Alabama.

I last talked with him in May and had a chance to thank him for all he has meant to countless millions of people and to my family and me. He was, without question, one of the most influential American leaders in the last 50 years whose voice impacted the lives of millions of families promoting a culture based on the biblical values needed to sustain our nation at a time when those values have been under relentless attack. His more than 70 books and weekday radio broadcast covered the full spectrum of marriage and family from couples just starting out to finishing well in our later years. Dr. Dobson lived what he wrote and spoke about; he finished well. 

Ann and I are praying for his wife Shirley, their children, their grandchildren, and that God will give them comfort and that they will feel the gratitude of all who were so blessed by Dr. Dobson’s ministry.",en,Tweet,0,14,1,5,678,2025-08-21 22:37:45,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1865390156519207275',"Today marks the 83rd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Dozens of Alabamians were killed on this tragic day, including 32 on the USS Arizona and Julius Ellsberry, who was believed to be the first Black Alabamian to die in World War II.

Today, we honor the memory of all these brave Alabamians, but I would like to specifically focus on Chief Carpenter John Arnold Austin from Warrior, Alabama.

On the morning of December 7th, John was on board the USS Oklahoma, which was the first ship to be attacked by the Japanese on Battleship Row. John and many of his shipmates found themselves trapped, but he found an escape route and is credited with saving 15 sailors that day. Unfortunately, he perished in the process.

Chief Carpenter Austin was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously. His citation reads, ""He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country."" The USS Austin, a destroyer escort, was later named in his honor.
