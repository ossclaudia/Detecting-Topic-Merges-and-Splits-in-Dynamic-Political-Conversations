'1968833092363206962',"On Saturday, September 27th, high school students are invited to our 2nd annual Summit for Emerging American Leaders (“SEAL” - get it?) at the John Cooper School in the Woodlands. This year’s lineup includes a football legend, an astronaut, a billionaire entrepreneur, and elected officials—all sharing their unique insights into the world and giving you the civics lessons you won’t learn in school. 
 
We’ll cover a wide range of topics—everything from leadership to entrepreneurship, cartels, diplomacy in wartime, the role of government, the frontiers of space, and more. Students will form a mock Congress and learn the reality of how bills become law.
 
Best part: attendees will receive a Congressional Commendation, a certificate that’s not only a point of pride but also a great addition to your resume and college applications.

President Reagan spoke about our free labor system (and owning the rewards of your own labor), drawing a sharp contrast from the oppressive labor systems behind the Iron Curtain, where your labor belonged only to the communist elites. 

Those systems treated workers as tools of the state. Ours treat workers as individuals, free to earn, build, innovate, and thrive. It’s the reason America became the most prosperous nation in history while socialist regimes collapse.

The old famous Soviet line come to mind: “We will pretend to work as long as they keep pretending to pay us!” That’s not a recipe for productivity or innovation. Achievements happen because people are incentivized by the belief that their hard work will pay off AND they’ll own it, not the state. 

The people who produce very little resent this system, always voting for politicians who promise to take from the productive members of society and redistribute their wealth to them. They offer up some rationale of an unequal playing field, social justice, etc- whatever buzzword of the day fits their agenda.

I love the Kingwood community and townhalls here have ALWAYS been productive and educational, even when we might disagree. 

I always give updates on my work in Congress–especially on flood mitigation since that affects Kingwood so profoundly. I always do Q&A. Always respectful.

Last night was different. 

Of the 400 people in the room, about fifty leftists would not stop interrupting with shouting and incoherent chanting. They demanded that we raise everyone's taxes, give free paychecks to able-bodied adults, and sneered at the success of the flood mitigation projects we’ve done that have saved lives and property. 

First clue that most of these protesters probably weren't actual constituents: they tried to shout me down when I gave an update on funding for FLOOD MITIGATION, which is priority #1 in Kingwood. 

They’d know how important these projects are if they actually lived in Kingwood during Hurricane Harvey. 

Anyways, the protestors did a great job of annoying all the actual constituents in the room and made it really easy to identify themselves with their red cards (you’ll see what I mean in the video. It was kind of hilarious actually).

Because of the tireless efforts of so many first responders and volunteers, they can rest together today as a family. 

I got to meet the family and friends of these amazing people. At just 12 years old, Shiloh was already a rodeo champion—tough, talented, and full of heart. He was in Kerr County for a rodeo competition - his mom and dad there to support him.

Just to set the record straight: the issue wasn’t just the parliamentarian stripping my amendment the second time around. Senate Republicans also chose the path of least resistance, and didn’t fight to protect kids from gender transition procedures by forcing Senate Democrats to raise a point of order.

No pushback; they just gave it up.

That kind of surrender is infuriating.

Is it everything I want? No.

Are there things in it I don’t want? Yes.

Perfect? Never. And never will be—this is reality, not utopia.

We vote on the aggregate of a bill and don’t obsess over imperfections.

So here is the aggregate:

✅It will keep YOUR individual taxes low by making President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent.
✅It protects safety nets by prioritizing the truly vulnerable and tightening abuse-prone loopholes.
✅It allows us to maintain a secured border with funding, manpower, and policy that restores law and order.
✅It unleashes American energy by clearing the way for domestic production and exports.
Does it “cost” trillions? Only if you concur with the philosophy that it costs the taxpayers money by letting taxpayers keep their money. Make that make sense.

Does it do *enough* to rein in runaway entitlement spending? No. But it does save almost a trillion dollars.

Also, CBO scores cannot take into account reasonable economic growth projections, nor can they take into account tariff revenue, which is substantial.

The bill cuts significant spending on net. The “cost” is letting you keep your income.

The President is right- Iran, a country whose motto is “Death to America”cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. Full stop. That is peace through strength. That is America First.

President Trump is doing EXACTLY what he should be doing: stating a clear red line (and a very reasonable one), and leaving all options on the table to deal with it.

No, none of this means we get dragged into a war. That is highly simplistic thinking. There are lots of options in between doing nothing and literally sending in the Marines.

The Israelis take preemptive action, destroying the Egyptian air forces on the ground and in six days capturing the Sinai Penninsula, the West Bank and the Golan Heights. Israeli borders expand because their enemies wanted war.

October 6, 1973: Egypt and Syria led a coalition of Arab armies to attack Israel on the holiest Jewish holiday. After initial gains Israel pushed them back, and threatened Cairo and Damascus before choosing to stop.

October 7, 2023: Hamas invades Israel, abducts 251 Israelis, and kills 1,200. Israel invaded Gaza and decimates Hamas, killing its leader in Tehran. Israel initiates a campaign to dismantle Hezboallah, using explosive beepers to take out operatives across Lebanon and killing it’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

'1931053063038501264',"President Reagan’s “Boys of Pointe du Hoc,” eloquently spoken in 1984 from the same cliffs where US Army Rangers achieved the impossible 40 years earlier.

Their mission: silence the German guns aimed at the Allied landings below. Pointe du Hoc was a strategic stronghold, perched between Utah and Omaha Beach, fortified with artillery and machine guns that could’ve shredded the invasion before it even started.

So before the main force hit the beach, 225 Army Rangers set out. They were led by a Texan and Aggie—Lieutenant Colonel James Earl Rudder. Under heavy fire, they fired rocket-propelled grappling hooks and scaled the 100-foot cliff. When they reached the top, they found the guns had been moved. But the mission didn’t stop there.

The Rangers searched, found the artillery, destroyed it, and held the line against fierce German counterattacks. For two straight days, they fought outnumbered and isolated.

When the battle was over, only 90 Rangers remained.
Rudder had been wounded twice and refused to leave. For his actions, he received the Distinguished Service Cross—the second-highest award for combat valor. In 2022, the surviving Rangers were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.

They didn’t climb that cliff for medals. They did it because it had to be done. They showed what courage, sacrifice, and American grit look like.

Ivan Guzman, El Chapo’s son, is now leading the Chapitos after Ovidio Guzman was arrested and extradited to the U.S.

But then, around the same time, 17 of Ovidio’s relatives crossed the border—and Ovidio changed his plea to guilty. Obviously there was some kind fo deal being made.

There’s been long-standing tension between the Chapitos and El Mayo factions of the Sinaloa cartel. The Chapitos live more dangerously. The Mayos are more traditional, calculating. They insulate themselves and stay out of the spotlight.

Here’s why all this matters: when cartels fight, they become vulnerable. A fractured Sinaloa cartel means an opportunity to strike. The Jalisco cartel is trying to take that opportunity.

Internal dysfunction inside the cartels is good for us, but in the end thr bad guys just move around the chess pieces a bit. To win, we acrually have to take down these groups while they’re weak and hold that territory.

The good news? We finally have presidents on both sides of the border who take this seriously.

'1907964541436072026',"Cartels had a lesson in FAFO.

Yesterday in Apatzingán, Michoacán, Mexican soldiers were ambushed by cartel gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Mexico’s new administration doesn’t retreat. They called in the big guns—literally. An armed helicopter from Mexico’s Secretariat of National Defense was deployed and lit up the hillside. Five cartel fighters didn’t make it out.

After the confrontation, Mexican military and police launched a joint operation to secure the area and hunt down any remaining cartel gunmen.

For too long, cartel thugs have operated as a terrorist insurgency—with heavy weapons, tactical gear, and complete disregard for law and life. This is the moment. We have willing partners in Mexico, and a willing administration in the White House.

I’ve been beating the drum about getting legislation done that would deliver the resources to take the cartels out (a Black Hawk helicopter, for instance, is not an assault helicopter, as it’s easy to shoot down. They need better aircraft.)

It gets worse. Their definition of “being at” a mass shooting includes people who *heard* gunshots nearby. You didn’t have to see a shooter, be threatened, or even realize what was happening. Wonder how many of these reports were just people who heard fireworks in the distance. That stretches reality to absurd lengths.

'1904635707294883965',"Right now, one unelected judge can shut down an entire national policy—immigration enforcement, border security, you name it. They’re using that power to block deportations and stall President Trump’s agenda before it even gets off the ground.

I don’t believe the judicial check was ever meant to be used so prolifically. It’s a necessary check, no doubt. There will often be disagreement between the Executive (charged to “execute” the law), and the courts. This is usually the fault of Congress for writing laws that are vague in nature. But that “check” cannot be a single unelected judge, effectively empowered with the same “execution” authority as the President. We must properly balance this important mechanism of checks and balances. 

That’s why I support the No Rogue Rulings Act.

I’m pushing @SpeakerJohnson hard to establish a Select Committee to Defeat the Mexican Drug Cartels. This is something nearly every Committee Chair supports and co-sponsored. What exactly does that look like? It means real resources. Professional staff. And a focused mission to confront this threat head-on.

For the last two years, I’ve been leading a task force without staff, without funding — over 30 meetings with experts and officials, multiple trips to Mexico, Colombia, and Panama. We’ve laid the groundwork. Now it’s time to scale it.

This issue cuts across ten different committees. That means no one owns it — and that’s a recipe for inaction. A Select Committee would fix that. It would focus Congress, align with the administration, and help deliver effective solutions.

The cartels are our greatest narco-terror threat. The mission is clear. The moment is now.

George Foreman wasn’t just a champion in the ring—he was a champion for our community.

Raised in Houston’s 5th Ward, he knew struggle. He turned that struggle into strength—winning Olympic gold in 1968, becoming a two-time heavyweight champion of the world, and redefining what redemption looks like. 

After walking away from boxing, George found faith. He became an ordained minister, started the George Foreman Youth and Community Center right here in Houston, and spent decades mentoring at-risk kids. 

He named all five of his sons George Edward Foreman. Why? To create unity. To build a bond that said, “If one goes up, we all go up.”

George gave his time, his resources, and his heart—quietly and consistently. From Kingwood to Huffman, folks knew “Big George” as the man who showed up, supported local schools, bought class projects just to give them back, and donated signed gloves to every charity that asked.

He never stopped serving. He never stopped believing. And he never forgot where he came from.

President Trump has made this a priority just like he said he would.

President Sheinbaum and her head of security Omar Harfuch are breaking records in drug busts and arrests, targeting Sinaloa’s fentanyl production mostly. They are also open to American help for the first time in…maybe ever. 

This is a terrorist-insurgency problem that is destroying Mexico and killing Americans. Defeating the cartels will require a Counter-Insurgency strategy that involves every agency in both the U.S. and Mexico. 

Our biggest problem? Congress still isn’t focused. I’ve worked for over a year as head of our Cartel Task Force (with no additional staff and no funding) to develop a whole-of-government strategy to defeat the cartels and produce the legislation that President Trump will need.

'1897725713345618095',"Today marks 189 years since the fall of the Alamo. You’ve heard the phrase a million times: “Remember the Alamo.” But why? What does that really mean?

The Alamo is more than a battlefield. More than a legend. It’s a dare. A dare to stand when you’re outnumbered. A dare to fight when surrender is easier. A dare to believe that principles—real, hard, inconvenient principles—are worth more than comfort, safety, or even survival.

In 1836, 189 men took that dare. They weren’t all Texans, and they weren’t all soldiers. But they had one thing in common—they refused to live under tyranny. They didn’t expect to win. They expected to die. And they did.

But here’s the thing: The Alamo wasn’t a defeat. It was a spark. A spark that burned into the soul of every Texan, igniting a fight that led to victory at San Jacinto. In just 18 minutes, Texas was free, and the world learned something about Americans—we don’t run.

 The spirit of the Alamo is still alive today. It lives in every American who stands for what’s right, who refuses to back down, and who chooses principle over convenience.

'1890113657884876986',"Since Russia’s war in Ukraine started, American deterrence and leadership have been at stake. That actually matters a lot—unless you want to re-enter the pre-WWII era of human history. Luckily, Trump’s leadership is changing the equation in Ukraine. As I’ve long argued, there’s an opportunity here now. With mounting Russian casualties and Trump’s willingness to impose tougher sanctions, leverage increases. Strength forces tough choices, and Putin knows he’s out of options. If we want this war to end on our terms, we also need to give him an off-ramp that secures stability without endless war. This is a delicate dance.

That’s why Secretary Hegseth is right—concessions will have to be made, which the Ukrainians know as well. We aren’t handing Putin a victory. Putin only achieves victory if he takes Ukraine and its capital. Instead, we’re forcing him into a deal that stops the bloodshed and strengthens our position for the long term.

“Winning” for America is simple: we must re-establish deterrence, and you do that by making Putin (and others like him) regret their decision to break 80 years of global norms and engage in a war of conquest.

As an agency within the State Department, USAID strayed far from its mission under Biden. Young, starry-eyed State Department employees turned taxpayer dollars into a woke global slush fund—funneling millions into DEI projects instead of prioritizing national security and strategic partnerships.

Congress may fund the State Department, but it’s the administration that decides how those dollars are spent. Now, with Secretary Rubio serving as Acting Director of USAID, I’m confident he’ll bring accountability to our foreign aid spending and refocus the State Department on real diplomacy.",en,Tweet,3,109,14,20,11940,2025-02-07 18:09:00,"<a href=""https://statusbrew.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Statusbrew</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1887926518052978688/vid/avc1/720x1280/JI4d3XV1cj41fCWF.mp4?tag=16
'1887652714403733871',"The House just passed the HALT Fentanyl Act, a bill I originally co-sponsored, because it’s the most obvious thing in the world to be in support of: stopping illicit fentanyl traffickers, saving lives, and giving law enforcement the tools they need. But of course, the Left still found a way to oppose it.

They pushed the same old fear-mongering, claiming that permanently scheduling illicit fentanyl as a Schedule I drug will lead to “mass incarceration.” That’s just not true.

Illicit fentanyl has been Schedule I since 2018—if their claims were true, we’d have already seen these so-called negative effects. We haven’t.

This bill doesn’t target users—it targets traffickers. The criminals lacing drugs with illicit fentanyl and killing Americans every single day.

Letting temporary scheduling expire would mean weaker enforcement, weaker laws, and more lives lost.

The House did its job. Now it’s up to the Senate. Pass the HALT Fentanyl Act. Stop the poison. Protect Americans.

'1877891646911635701',"Yes, Gen Z, we get it—you don’t care about data privacy. But that’s just a tiny part of the story.

The real issue here is control. The Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to build a blueprint of influence over you and our society. They’re not just tracking what you do; they’re deciding what you see, and therefore *how you think*. There is plenty of evidence this is already happening.

Now imagine how much more powerful it would be as an information warfare weapon when the proverbial shit hits the fan in a potential conflict over Taiwan. Yeah, the Chinese will take control of all advanced semi-conductor chips in Taiwan (the ones that power your precious smartphone), and then use your addiction to TikTok to convince you it’s all a good idea.

TikTok, as an entertainment platform, is an incredible product. It’s fun, it’s creative, and millions of Americans love using it. But we also need to recognize that it’s a Trojan horse. And right now, that horse is carrying Chinese Communist Party influence into our backyard and sending American’s data back to Beijing. That’s the problem we need to solve.

The goal here is not about trying to stop American small businesses who use TikTok to promote themselves, the latest dances, or end “brain rot” trends—though maybe fixing that wouldn’t hurt either. It’s about making sure that enjoyment doesn’t come at the cost of our privacy, our freedom, or our national security.

There’s a way to fix this. We don’t need to kill TikTok; we need to kick the Chinese Communist Party out of it. Ownership by someone who shares—or at least respects—our democratic values is the solution. People like Kevin O’Leary from Shark Tank and Dodgers owner Frank McCourt are already exploring a potential acquisition.

'1865117181014376883',"Chloe Cole’s story is gut-wrenching, but it’s one everyone needs to hear.

At 12 years old, she told her parents she was a boy. They took her to therapists and doctors, hoping for guidance. Instead, every single one of them pushed the Left’s gender ideology. They didn’t ask questions, didn’t explore other causes of her distress—they just told her parents she *had* to transition or else she’d take her own life. By 13, she was on puberty blockers and testosterone. At 15, they removed her breasts. By 16, she realized it was all a terrible mistake.

And now, her story is more relevant than ever. The Supreme Court is reviewing Tennessee’s ban on gender transition treatments for minors—a case that could set a national precedent.

Chloe’s courage to speak out is saving lives, exposing an industry profiting off kids while ignoring lifelong consequences.

Share her story. Follow the case. The lives and futures of countless children depend on it.

These days, academics are teaching only the trendy “counter-narratives.” Instead of focusing first on teaching the mainstream story of history, they partake in this faux noble cause by teaching only the counter-narratives.

Understanding counter-narratives and opposing views can help develop critical thinking skills. The problem, however, is that they’re the *only* things many teachers are teaching. Students are left with an incomplete and biased view of history.
