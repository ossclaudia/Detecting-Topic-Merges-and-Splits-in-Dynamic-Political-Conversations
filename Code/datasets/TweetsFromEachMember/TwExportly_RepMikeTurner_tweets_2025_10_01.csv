'1841578294719795603',"Congratulations to @SecGenNATO Mark Rutte. Your leadership will ensure that @NATO promotes our shared values of democracy and freedom. Now more than ever, the world needs an engaged and strengthened NATO responding to the threats to peace and stability from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine exemplifies the continuing conflict between authoritarianism and democracy. The U.S. delegation to @NATOPAPress is eager to work with you to strengthen our transatlantic alliance.

Thank you to @JensStoltenberg for your decade of service as the NATO Secretary General. Secretary General Stoltenberg oversaw the enlargement of NATO, including the Alliance’s newest members, Finland and Sweden. Secretary General Stoltenberg clearly demonstrated his commitment to the 2014 Wales pledge. During his tenure, over 20 member countries achieved the critical goal of spending at least two percent of their GDP on national defense. We congratulate Mr. Stoltenberg on his new role at @MunSecConf.",en,Tweet,1,16,2,18,1618,2024-10-02 21:37:34,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

For more than twenty years, @MarchMadnessMBB’s has had its tip-off in the Miami Valley.

Earlier this year, I sent a bipartisan letter to the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Committee urging them to continue hosting the “First Four” games at the @UnivofDayton.

The “First Four” is an incredible showcase of our community and love of basketball. It brings economic opportunities to our region, and as Dayton’s congressman and former mayor, I will continue to support to continue this wonderful tradition.

Over the last few years, 15,000 to 20,000 Haitian migrants have settled in Springfield. With a population of approximately 60,000 people, these migrants have put a significant strain on the city’s resources, including housing, hospitals, and schools.
