'1940842219100897615',"My statement on the passage of the Big Bad Bill: 

This year, we had a real opportunity to pass a budget that put the middle class first. The reality of slim majorities in both chambers of Congress should have created an incentive to work across the aisle. The parties could have worked together to extend middle-class tax cuts without giveaways to corporations and the wealthy. We could have built on the success of $35 insulin and Medicare drug price negotiations to make health care more affordable. We could have reduced the deficit — something both parties agree should be a priority.

Instead, from the very beginning, this GOP majority has used a broken, partisan process where the only choices put on the floor seemed to be ‘bad’ or ‘worse.’

As a result, we have a law that will take health care away from tens of thousands of Mainers, close rural hospitals across the country, and blow up the national debt — all to pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit those at the top. While I am proud to join the entire Maine delegation in voting against this bill, the truth is Mainers will suffer because of this partisan, harmful budget.",en,Tweet,6,157,34,19,22799,2025-07-03 19:36:58,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

Some claim that requiring proof of citizenship is too onerous a burden, or that it will ""disenfranchise"" those whose names have changed for reasons like marriage. The truth is the SAVE Act ensures name changes will not prevent anyone from registering to vote.

The bill allows for several different ways to prove citizenship. But most importantly, it requires state leaders to establish protocols to allow citizens to register even if there are discrepancies in documents, such as name changes.

'1907566369539023142',"President Trump has introduced a number of new tariff policies, and I and my team are already digging into the details. I’ll have more to say on the specifics in the next few days.

What I can say now is I’m pleased the president is building his tariff agenda on the foundation of a universal 10 percent tariff like the one I proposed in the BUILT USA Act. This ring fence around the American economy is a good start to erasing our unsustainable trade deficits.

I’m eager to work with the president to fix the broken ""free trade"" system that made multinational corporations rich but ruined manufacturing communities across the country. But tariffs must be paired with policies that prioritize American families’ prosperity. We need to make sure that the new approach benefits working people — that means supporting unions, the trades and apprenticeship programs, cutting regulations that hold back production, unleashing American energy and using tariff revenue to support domestic manufacturers that create good-paying jobs for Americans.

It’s also time to renegotiate trade deals like the USMCA to support the Americans who are ready to ramp up production and support the rebuilding of our middle class — like the sawmills, processing plants, fishermen and farmers in the communities I represent.

Tariffs are a first step in rewriting a rigged trade system, but they cannot be the last one.",en,Tweet,22,198,38,57,19935,2025-04-02 23:50:38,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
