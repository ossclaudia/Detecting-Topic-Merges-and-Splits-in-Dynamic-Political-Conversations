However, I supported the CR because it’s better than the original proposal and better than a government shutdown, which would only harm the American public and kneecap President Trump as he is about to take office.

This package also received my support because it addresses the immediate needs of Third District Arkansans and includes provisions I’ve advocated for. Under my Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee’s jurisdiction, there’s $122 million included in disaster assistance directly for Arkansans who are recovering and rebuilding from the devastating Memorial Day weekend storms. It also provides much-needed resources to Arkansas' agriculture industry dealing with crop loss, government overregulation, and high inflation. These are real-life deliverables for those I proudly represent that cannot be ignored.

I hope through a unified government beginning in the new year, Republicans will focus on righting our nation's financial ship and passing full-year appropriations as we advance President Trump's agenda.",en,Tweet,4,58,8,43,6663,2024-12-20 23:46:16,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
