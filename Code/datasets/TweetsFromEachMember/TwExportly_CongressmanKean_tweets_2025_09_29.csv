'1964432192739954837',"I applaud President Trump for taking decisive action yesterday to create a designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention of Americans. In June, I joined @RepFrenchHill (AR-02), @RepMikeLawler (NY-17), @RepJoshG (NJ-05), and @RepMoskowitz (FL-23) in introducing the bipartisan Countering Wrongful Detention Act of 2025, which establishes this very designation for countries or nonstate actors that hold American citizens or permanent residents hostage. This legislation equips both the Secretary of State and Congress with new tools to hold these governments accountable by encouraging a range of penalties.
 
For my constituent, Sarah (Levinson) Moriarty, this issue hits especially close to home. Her father, Robert Levinson, was taken hostage by Iran in 2007. For years, her family lived in absolute uncertainty, wondering where he was, whether he was alive, or if they would ever see him again. Unfortunately, they never did. Far too many American families have endured that same fear, heartbreak, and loss. With this important legislation, paired with today’s executive order, we are making real strides to ensure that no family is ever forced to live through this tragedy again.
 
Hostile regimes like Iran continue to use innocent Americans as bargaining chips by dehumanizing, abusing, and in some cases killing them. This legislation would codify President Trump’s executive order and make clear that there will be consequences for using Americans as political pawns. The United States will not tolerate this behavior, and we will always stand up for our citizens, no matter where they are in the world.",en,Tweet,0,14,2,9,959,2025-09-06 21:55:06,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1940842187383529477',"This afternoon, Congress passed a commonsense legislative package that was a major win for New Jerseyans and Americans across the country. We secured the full SALT deduction for every middle-class family in New Jersey. I never backed down from the fight for SALT relief, standing up to Democrats and Republicans alike to quadruple the deduction to $40,000. I also stood with American innovators, voting to renew R&D tax credits for the research and development that businesses do to fuel ingenuity and job creation.

I voted to safeguard Medicaid for every intended beneficiary in the Garden State and nationwide. By rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, we are preserving this vital program for today’s recipients and future generations. I also voted to protect New Jersey’s expansion of certain critical supplemental payments they receive from the federal government—an important financing tool that hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care providers rely on to serve Medicaid patients. Finally, this bill allocates $50 billion over five years to hospitals and health care providers, ensuring patients continue to receive quality care in New Jersey and throughout the country.

We permanently increased the Child Tax Credit to $2,200, delivering meaningful relief to young families still struggling under the weight of four years of record inflation. We secured necessary resources for Somerset and Morris Counties, and the entire state, by investing tens of millions of dollars in local and state law enforcement to better equip them to protect President Trump and surrounding communities.

We made significant progress on key priorities like securing the border, unleashing American energy and advancement, and strengthening national security—all while cutting wasteful spending, advancing affordability, and making the federal government both more efficient and more accountable.

Once President Trump signs this bill into law, life will become more affordable for residents of New Jersey’s Seventh District. They will see immediate tax relief, greater transparency from Washington, and more support for innovation. This is a crucial step toward a stronger, more secure future for the next generation.",en,Tweet,2,119,18,46,7940,2025-07-03 19:36:51,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

I led the fight to restore our property tax deduction, and we won. The House bill restores the full SALT deduction for middle-class families, providing up to $40,000 in deductibility.

On healthcare, we protected Medicaid for every intended beneficiary in New Jersey and across the country and stopped illegal immigrants from stealing taxpayer-funded benefits. By rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, we can ensure that this vital program is there for current and future generations of Americans.

We also boosted the Child Tax Credit to $2,500, giving young families a much-needed return at a time when they need it most.

We secured critical relief for Somerset and Morris Counties and the whole state of New Jersey by providing tens of millions of dollars for local and state law enforcement, ensuring they are supported while protecting President Trump over the next four years.

We continued delivering for the American people by voting to secure our borders, unleash American energy and innovation, and invest in national security, all while cutting wasteful spending and making the federal government more efficient, accountable, and effective.
