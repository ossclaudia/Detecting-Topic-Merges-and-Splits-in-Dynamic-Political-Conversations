It makes our nation sicker, hungrier and financially feebler, and all to fatten the bulging wallets of the wealthy and big corporations.

These are hard facts confirmed by independent experts like the Congressional Budget Office.

The more that people learn about this bill – needlessly rammed through, with too little debate, mostly while America slept – the less popular it becomes. Its main theme, stealing healthcare and food from paycheck-to-paycheck families just to funnel whopping tax break windfalls to the wealthy, is an obscenity. Its temporary crumbs of relief for workers are dwarfed by a feast of permanent benefits for the superrich.

But Democrats will not let its destructive roots choke America’s promise.
