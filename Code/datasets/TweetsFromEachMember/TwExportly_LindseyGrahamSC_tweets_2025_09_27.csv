It is now time to put more tools in President Trump’s toolbox in order to end the war. 

I expect the Senate will move the bipartisan Russian sanctions bill that will allow tariffs and sanctions to be placed on countries who prop up Putin’s war machine and do not help Ukraine. The bill will have a presidential waiver to give President Trump maximum leverage. This bill has 85 cosponsors and counting. It’s time to end this bloodbath.

I agree with President Trump that the military strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities were highly effective. The Israelis have also said as much.

In terms of deterring the ayatollah’s desire for a nuclear weapon, I don’t believe anything has changed.

I am going to ask the intelligence community whether or not they have seen any evidence since the strike that Iran is changing its stated goal of having a nuclear enrichment program and whether or not it’s still the policy of the Iranian regime to destroy the State of Israel and attack the United States.

Early indications seem to be nothing has changed in terms of the regime’s goals. The head of the Iranian nuclear program, Mohammad Eslami, said yesterday that they’re restarting their nuclear program.

My goal is for the Iranian regime to change its behavior, ending its desire to obtain a nuclear weapons capability, destroy Israel, and target the United States.

A simple question for the Iranian regime: is it still your policy to destroy the State of Israel and refuse to acknowledge its right to exist?

A ceasefire that leads to peace is wonderful. A ceasefire that allows Iran to regroup and re-arm is a step backwards. 

How can you tell the difference? If Iran recognizes Israel’s right to exist.

Making the tax cuts permanent, increasing defense spending and providing money to secure our border is an essential part of this bill, and it needs to be passed now.
 
When it comes to spending reductions, here’s the reality:
 
✅ The reconciliation process is focused only on mandatory spending. By law, changes to Social Security cannot be a part of reconciliation.
 
✅ Medicare has been virtually untouched in both the House and Senate proposals. Medicaid reforms like work requirements and dealing with the provider tax scam are sources of legitimate savings without reducing benefits for those who need it. Medicaid spending has grown by nearly 50% in the last 5 years and it is now time to address this problem.

'1912986875133931590',"I’m very pleased to hear that the Supreme Court will review President Trump’s executive order to end the abuses of birthright citizenship.

I have long believed that the 14th amendment does not require granting citizenship to the children of illegal aliens or foreign nationals here on temporary, nonimmigrant visas. To that end, last year I introduced legislation to limit birthright citizenship.

One of the greatest pull factors for illegal immigration is birthright citizenship. In addition, birth tourism, particularly involving China, is a large industry where people obtain tourist visas for the purpose of giving birth in the U.S. and establishing U.S. citizenship for that child. It is far past time for the United States to recognize the original, constitutional definition of birthright citizenship, as the current practice is being abused in so many ways.

It is my hope the Court will settle this issue once and for all, and that my legislation to stop the abuse of birthright citizenship will pass quickly.

'1897716403425181885',"It is time to end the war between Russia and Ukraine justly and honorably, as President Trump is trying to do.

Pushing the Ukrainians toward peace and trying to secure a critical minerals agreement with them makes perfect sense to me. Talking to Russia about how to end the conflict makes perfect sense to me. 

Ukraine has made major announcements in the last 48 hours about ceasefires, the minerals deal, and their willingness to engage in peace talks.

Putin has been defiant and resistant publicly to President Trump’s overtures. If Putin refuses to seriously come to the peace table, I hope and expect that President Trump would unleash more economic sanctions on Russia’s banking and energy sectors, and if necessary, apply massive tariffs. The impact on Russia’s already weak economy will force them to the table.

As Senate Budget Committee Chairman, I’m incredibly pleased by the discipline shown by my Senate Republican colleagues to ensure that the most transformational border security bill in history can soon become a reality.

This budget resolution allows the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees to spend up to $175 billion in total to implement President Trump’s border security agenda. It instructs the Armed Services Committee to spend up to $150 billion to make our military more lethal. It also allocates up to $20 billion to be spent to modernize the Coast Guard.

It does not direct how money will be spent — it only sets a number.

This budget resolution directs other Senate committees to find spending cuts to fully pay for the much-needed funding for border security and the U.S. military.

However, it is not helpful to suggest that Ukraine needs to enter NATO because Putin is planning to take over Europe. 

If Putin plans to take over Europe, clearly he is not intimidated by NATO. I believe very strongly that Putin wants no part of a war with NATO because it would be the end of Putin’s Russia.  

My proposal to deter Putin is simple: Learn from the mistakes of 2014. 

1. Arm Ukraine by selling them American weapons over the next decade to prevent future Russian military incursions.

2. Pursue economic integration between Ukraine and the U.S. that would be financially beneficial to both countries and would create a new relationship to counter Russia.

The ayatollah and his henchmen are not trustworthy on the nuclear front. Their ambitions to obtain a nuclear weapon are crystal clear based on decades of lies and deceit.

When the Iranian Regime says death to Israel and America, they mean it.

A nuclear-armed Iran is an existential threat to Israel and a nightmare for the world.

This resolution clearly demonstrates that the Iranian regime is lying when it says they only want nuclear power and not a nuclear weapon. This is not an authorization for the use of military force, but a resolution establishing the truth regarding Iran’s nuclear intentions and capability.

'1841915272938266712',"This is the 1930's all over again. G7 leaders  –  led by President Biden – are urging Israel to have a proportional and limited response against the Iranian regime.

Apparently the G7 views Iran as a normal nation. It is not.

I have been working with President Biden and his team for over a year and a half to achieve normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel – building on the Abraham Accords brokered by President Trump.  This would be a historic shift in the Middle East. I believe the October 7 attack by Hamas  –  financed and supported by Iran  –  was designed to stop this process. I will continue to push for normalization.

When it comes to Iran, the regime is a theocracy dedicated to destroying the Jewish state, driving the west out of the Middle East, and stopping reconciliation between the Arab world and Israel. The Ayatollah is a religious Nazi. Iran is not trying to build peaceful nuclear power plants. The regime is trying to build a nuclear bomb to achieve its religious objectives. If you don’t understand that, you’re not listening to what Iran is saying and you’re not watching what they are doing throughout the world.

For the sake of our friends in Israel, we cannot allow the world to miscalculate Iran, just as it did with Hitler and the Nazis.

I truly believe if Iran had a nuclear weapon, the Ayatollah would use it against Israel.

The idea of telling Israel what targets to strike ignores reality and is the mentality that existed in the 1930’s.

Would a proportional response be launching 200 ballistic missiles from Israel into Iran, mimicking what the Iranians did to Israel?

To my friends in Israel, one holocaust directed at the Jewish people is enough. Do what you have to do to defend yourselves against those who would kill you simply because you are Jewish.

I can assure you Iran attacks Israel at their own peril.

While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s statement, we cannot forget that when President Trump left office, Iran was weak economically, and he sent the regime the ultimate message with the elimination of Soleimani.

The only thing the Iranian regime understands is strength. Now is the time to show unified resolve against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism.
