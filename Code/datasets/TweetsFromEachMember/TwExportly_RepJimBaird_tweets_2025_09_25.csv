'1940844945369117000',"🚨 My statement on voting for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to deliver the largest tax cut in American history:

“After months of hard work and thoughtful deliberation, I was proud to vote for the One Big, Beautiful Bill and help send it to President Trump’s desk. This includes much-needed tax relief for the American people. This bill delivers the largest tax cut in American history for workers, families, and seniors by ending taxes on tips and overtime for millions of workers and slashing taxes on Social Security. It also makes a generational investment in Rural America by expanding crop insurance, strengthening biosecurity measures, and boosting investment in the farm safety net, and it prevents a Death Tax increase that would devastate thousands of family farms in Indiana’s Fourth Congressional District. On top of these monumental wins, the One Big Beautiful Bill invests in our border security to deliver the most secure border on record and delivers on President Trump’s successful foreign policy of peace through strength.
 
“There has been a lot of misleading information on this bill. This legislation strengthens federal programs for those who truly need them and enacts common-sense work requirements that a majority of Americans support. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score assumes an incorrect baseline that simply does not reflect current policy. In reality, the One Big Beautiful Bill reduces the deficit, marking a long-overdue return to fiscal sanity in Washington.
 
“This bill ultimately fulfills many of the promises made to the American people. As we celebrate Independence Day and the birth of our nation, I am pleased to deliver these significant wins that ensure America truly remains the greatest country in history.”",en,Tweet,0,14,3,20,1544,2025-07-03 19:47:48,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

For four years, Hoosiers were buckling under the numerous crises caused by President Biden and Congressional Democrats’ failed leadership. Tonight, President Trump laid out his bold agenda to renew the American dream and restore American excellence.

President Trump has been working at a rapid pace to deliver on his successful America First agenda. The president is already reclaiming our leadership on the world stage and will restore peace in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. This is a far cry from President Biden’s failed foreign policy of appeasement.

In his first month in office, the President took executive action to secure our southern border and sign the Laken Riley Act into law. As a result, we have seen the lowest number of monthly illegal border crossings on record. The Trump Administration is also taking historic action to unleash American energy dominance, rescind burdensome regulations, drive investment in American industries, root out waste, fraud, and abuse in our federal government, and lower costs for Hoosiers to ensure the American Dream is more achievable than ever.

President Trump’s Joint Address made it clear: under President Trump and House and Senate Republicans’ leadership, this is truly the beginning of the Golden Age of America, and we will work hard to make the American Dream a reality once again.",en,Tweet,0,4,1,5,571,2025-03-05 04:01:46,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,
