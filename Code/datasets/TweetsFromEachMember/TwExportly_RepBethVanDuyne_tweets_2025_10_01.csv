'1966160813120528782',"Our nation’s story is one of courage, heroism, and self-sacrifice for an ideal greater than ourselves. Above all other nations, the United States of America endures as a beacon of freedom, bravery, and indomitable spirit—especially in the face of tragedy and destruction. Twenty-four years ago, as Islamic terrorists sought to break our nation’s spirit and extinguish the flame of freedom, countless heroes rose up to renew our faith and strengthen our resolve.

Among them was Welles Crowther, “the man in the red bandana.” A 24-year-old volunteer firefighter, Welles repeatedly charged into the flames of the South Tower to lead eighteen people to safety before giving his life as the building collapsed. He brought calm in the midst of terror, saved lives so families could be made whole again, and left us an enduring example that even in times of unthinkable calamity, we can reach beyond ourselves to serve others.

This year’s remembrance of 9/11 comes with added sorrow. Just yesterday, our conservative movement lost a great friend and remarkable leader: Charlie Kirk. Charlie embodied grace in the face of hostility, deep love for our nation, hope for every soul he encountered, and unshakable faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ. He inspired millions of young Americans to find purpose, rejoice in their love of Christ, and cherish the blessings of family and children. Though his years were too few—just thirty-one—Charlie’s life was marked by courage, conviction, and self-sacrifice worthy of recognition on a day when we honor American heroes like Welles Crowther.

May God bless their souls, and may we find the courage to protect and preserve an America worthy of their sacrifice.",en,Tweet,0,23,2,3,1401,2025-09-11 16:24:02,"<a href=""https://sproutsocial.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Sprout Social</a>",,,,
'1965909366118154276',"Today, America lost an incredible Patriot—a man of tremendous faith in God, who inspired millions of young Americans with his infectious enthusiasm for our great nation, our unmatched liberties, and the promise that only the United States offers to all of mankind.

I was honored to spend time with Charlie and to be invited to speak at Turning Point USA events in North Texas. The thousands of young people who attended left those events beaming with pride in our country and with a renewed sense of purpose to preserve what is so great and exceptional about America.

Charlie also touched my own family. My son looked up to him and, as a teenager, saved money to attend a TPUSA event in Washington, D.C. Charlie was kind and generous with his time to him there, just as he was again when he spoke at an event in Dallas that my son and I attended together. Those moments left a lasting impression and deepened my admiration for his dedication to lifting up young people.

My heart is broken for Charlie’s family, his wife Erika, and the millions of young lives who found comfort and strength in his patriotism. That will be Charlie’s legacy: new generations of unwavering patriots who love our nation, will fight for our future, and will never back away from preserving our liberties, moral goodness, faith in our Creator, and our most beloved America.

Hug your loved ones, pray for Charlie and his family, and then steel your resolve to move forward.

This was violent, organized crime that needs to be utterly taken apart - the Stop FUNDERs Act will help do just that!

The One Big Beautiful Bill is a bold and necessary step to promote economic growth, empower American businesses and manufacturers, and support our workers. It protects families and small businesses from devastating tax hikes and restores a path to long-term prosperity.

'1869920902625800386',"No one should be surprised by my no vote. I have never supported this level of government spending since I have been in office. Voting against this enormous deficit spending is consistent with what I have promised the people of the 24th District I would do. I truly believe government spending is out of control and has led us to record-breaking inflation, the highest debt in our nation’s history, and pernicious federal intrusion into the lives of Americans. 

This past November, the American people spoke clearly, saying they wanted to end massive federal overspending which has driven painful and enduring inflation that is profoundly harming our families and businesses.  

I have tremendous faith that a 2nd Trump Administration coupled with Republican majorities in the House and Senate, will allow us to make major reforms to slash federal spending and job-killing regulations while delivering tax cuts to empower the kind of growth we need to expand our way out of budget deficits as well as make progress against the national debt.
