Following repeated calls for an investigation into the mail issues there from me and my colleagues in Missouri and Illinois, the USPS Office of Inspector General released their findings from the audit they conducted over the last 3 months at the St. Louis facility.
 
In just two days in June, almost 2.6 million pieces of mail were delayed. If that wasn’t bad enough, they only reported around 1.5 million pieces as delayed. They weren't even reporting the missed mail correctly! On top of that, over 50% of all outbound mail trips from the STL processing facility from May 2024 - April 2025 were late or canceled. Local carriers can’t deliver the mail if it doesn’t get to them. That’s completely unacceptable.
 
Management acknowledges that there were issues and promised to fix them. That’s not gonna cut it. It’s time for management to go and the Postal Service needs to overhaul this facility completely so Northeast Missouri can start getting their mail on time once again.
