While vote by mail is still being counted, I am delighted to share that 27 of our 28 endorsed candidates are on their way to victory.

Many of these candidates overcame the odds and flipped Republican strongholds. Voters across Illinois sent a clear and decisive message: we reject the extremist MAGA agenda and the candidates who support it or enable it with their silence.

I want to extend a special congratulations to Bobby Hernandez and Dems for Addison Township, Sheila Ruthledge and Win for Winfield, Buffy Higgins-Beard and the Milton Dems Slate, Elk Grove Township Forward, Ashfaq Syed for Naperville City Council, and John for Aurora.
