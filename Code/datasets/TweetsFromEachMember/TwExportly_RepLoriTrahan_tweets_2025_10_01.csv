'1946184744061858068',"Public broadcasting isn’t just Big Bird and Sesame Street – it’s how families in Massachusetts and across the country get lifesaving emergency alerts, stay connected to their communities, and access trusted, educational programming. Slashing support for public radio and television will silence local newsrooms, especially in rural areas, and undermine the emergency broadcast systems we rely on in times of crisis.

We saw the consequences of weakened alert systems during the catastrophic floods in Texas. Communities were caught flat-footed, in part because they lacked access to timely, reliable emergency broadcasts. Contrast that with what we saw just yesterday in Alaska, where public broadcasters immediately issued alerts after a powerful 7.3 magnitude offshore earthquake, potentially saving lives. These two realities show exactly what’s at stake. If these cuts move forward, the Trump administration will be making a conscious choice to leave communities more vulnerable, more isolated, and less safe.

'1945949919048613985',"Crypto is here to stay. That’s why we can’t afford to wait any longer to establish guardrails that protect consumers and bring long-overdue transparency to this rapidly evolving industry.
 
I voted YES on the GENIUS Act because it’s a meaningful step toward ensuring that Americans who choose to invest in stablecoins are protected from fraud and abuse. This bill is far from perfect and more must be done to confront the blatant corruption we’re seeing from Donald Trump, who has shamelessly used his position as President to line his pockets with millions in crypto. I’ll keep fighting for strong anti-corruption legislation to stop the kind of self-dealing that’s happening in plain sight.
 
I voted NO on the CLARITY Act. I support a regulatory framework that distinguishes between digital assets, fosters innovation, and promotes responsible growth, but this bill simply doesn’t get us there. It’s riddled with loopholes and carveouts that leave everyday investors exposed to the kinds of volatile, often fraudulent crypto schemes we’ve seen too regularly with memecoins. It fails to strike the right balance between innovation and consumer protection. As the bill moves to the Senate, it’s critical that our colleagues strengthen it, starting with ensuring that states like Massachusetts retain the authority to crack down on fraud and abuse.
 
I believe we can support innovation in the crypto space while standing firmly against the predatory practices that have taken root in the absence of meaningful oversight.

It slashes $3.7 billion from MassHealth, threatening health care for children, seniors, and working families.

At its core, this bill is a heartless transfer of wealth from those who need help the most to those who need it the least.

Donald Trump’s so-called ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ guts SNAP benefits, taking food off the tables of thousands of families across the Commonwealth already squeezed by higher prices. Instead of closing tax loopholes for the ultra-wealthy, Republicans chose to make it harder for parents to feed their kids. It’s a shameful betrayal of the people we’re elected to serve.

Despite all their talk of fiscal responsibility, this bill – crafted in secret by Donald Trump and passed in the middle of the night by House Republicans – adds $3.8 trillion to the deficit. That reckless spending triggers automatic cuts, including nearly half a trillion dollars from Medicare.

The math doesn’t lie: this bill isn’t about helping working people – it’s about enriching the wealthy at everyone else’s expense. I voted no, and I will keep fighting to stop this dangerous bill from becoming law.

Whether advocating for the most vulnerable, calling on global leaders to act on climate change, or urging the Church to be a more welcoming place for all, Pope Francis led with a spirit of love and service.

'1913726669916873076',"When our nation commemorated the centennial of the Revolution back in 1875, women were denied a seat at the table, and their contributions in the lead-up to and during the battles of Concord and Lexington were dismissed, if not outright ignored.

It was Louisa May Alcott – another legendary woman of Concord – who had the courage to call that out, documenting how women were excluded from the celebrations and erased from the narrative.

We did not make that same mistake today.

I had the honor of welcoming to Concord two women whose lives and work have not only shaped how we understand our history but are actively influencing the future of our democracy: @DorisKGoodwin, a longtime Concord resident and one of our nation’s most gifted historians, and @RosieRios, the 43rd Treasurer of the United States.",en,Tweet,2,10,0,7,1220,2025-04-19 23:49:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Go7sMJrWYAAnJly.jpg
'1913637081898688788',"250 years ago, right here at the Old North Bridge, ordinary people faced an extraordinary choice: monarchy or democracy. They could remain subjects of a distant crown – or risk everything for the idea of self-government.

They chose freedom.

Farmers and blacksmiths, shopkeepers and ministers, teachers and mothers – everyday citizens who had no guarantee of success – stood their ground. And when the smoke cleared on that April morning, the first shots of a revolution had been fired.

What began here in Concord became “the shot heard round the world.” It was more than the beginning of a battle – it was the beginning of an idea.

That liberty is worth defending. That government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed. That even the smallest towns in the smallest colonies could stir the conscience of a world.

But it was never inevitable.

The men and women who gathered here were not professional soldiers or political elites. They were neighbors and parents. Workers and worshippers. People with families to protect, farms to tend, and lives to live. And yet, when the moment came, they answered history’s call.

Today, as we mark the 250th anniversary of that defining moment, we gather not just to honor their courage – but to reckon with the responsibility they left us.",en,Tweet,0,19,3,7,791,2025-04-19 17:53:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1913636941796397056/vid/avc1/1080x1920/kuIUWivow8ie3JJK.mp4?tag=16

We’ve all been in a group chat. I’m in one for my daughter’s lacrosse team where we coordinate snacks and travel.

You know what happens when we start a chat? And when new moms are added? We do a quick sound-off so everyone can identify who is in the group so we know who we’re talking to. Basic stuff. 

Our nation’s most senior national security officials failed to meet even that minimal standard before engaging in a classified discussion — never mind that they were using Signal, a platform long flagged as insecure for sensitive communications.

'1897770329079964031',"Our veterans have sacrificed so much to defend the freedoms and values we hold dear, and they deserve nothing less than the highest quality care and support in return. The Trump Administration’s plan to slash the VA workforce — many of whom are veterans themselves — is nothing short of a betrayal of our nation’s promise to those who have served.

Gut the VA, and you gut veterans’ access to the care and resources they’ve earned. These reckless reductions will lead to longer wait times, reduced services, and diminished support for those who have already given so much. Instead of investing in the well-being of our veterans, Trump’s plan prioritizes cuts over care, leaving those who served our country to bear the consequences.

We cannot allow this to happen. Our commitment to veterans doesn’t end when they come home — it must be lifelong. I will fight against these harmful cuts and work to ensure that the VA has the resources, staffing, and support it needs to fulfill its mission.

'1897151515988521340',"Once again, Donald Trump stood before the American people and made big promises that will never come to fruition. We’ve seen this time and again – grand declarations that distract from the harm his administration and his party continue to inflict on working families.

Even as he spoke tonight, Republicans in Congress are working overtime to strip health care from millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid, including children with disabilities and seniors in assisted living facilities. Meanwhile, Trump’s dangerous cuts to the NIH threaten life-saving medical research, and his party’s planned attack on the Social Security Administration will make it harder for seniors to access the benefits they’ve earned.

At the same time, Trump’s ill-conceived trade war is set to unleash the largest tax increase on working families in U.S. history, driving up prices on everyday goods even further. While he soaked up the applause, families watched their 401ks tank as the stock market plunged instantly in response to the Trump Tariffs. Families across the country are struggling to pay their heating bill or afford eggs and other groceries, all of which continue to get more expensive under the havoc he has wreaked.

Not a single thing Donald Trump said tonight will lower prices for families next week, next month, or even next year. He offered no real plan to bring down the cost of housing, groceries, or prescription drugs, no willingness to stand up to Elon Musk’s efforts to slow down Social Security checks and tax returns, and no plan to make life easier for the middle class.
