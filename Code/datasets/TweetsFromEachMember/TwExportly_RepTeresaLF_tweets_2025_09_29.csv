'1965119221282529378',"🚨 La Corte Suprema acaba de poner en riesgo a todos los latinos en Estados Unidos. 

El gobierno debe proteger a toda su gente — no condenar a millones de latinos a vivir con miedo en el país donde son ciudadanos, algunos por décadas.

Hoy, la Corte Suprema abrió la puerta a un mundo donde basta con parecer latino, hablar español o trabajar un empleo humilde para que agentes armados te detengan, te tiren al suelo y te exijan “pruebas” de que eres ciudadano.

¿Qué significa para nuestras comunidades? 

Padres esposados en frente de sus hijos, vendedores ambulantes llevados a cárceles como criminales, trabajadores interrogados porque su licencia de manejar “no es suficiente”. Ahora, esta decisión casi obliga a los latinos a cargar su pasaporte todos los días, como si ser latino en este país fuera un crimen.

'1950651277295468727',"Sixty years ago today, we made a promise: that every American—young or old, rich or poor, rural or urban—deserves health care they can count on. That promise became Medicare and Medicaid.
 
Today, more than 140 million people rely on these programs. In New Mexico, they keep our rural hospitals open, our babies delivered safely, and our families healthy.
 
But that promise is under attack.
Donald Trump and House Republicans have launched a full-blown assault on Americans’ health care. Their “Betrayed for Billionaires Budget” will: 

❌ Kick 15 million Americans off their health care

❌ Cut $1 trillion total from Medicaid and health care to pay for handouts to the wealthiest few

❌ Cut $535 billion from Medicare

❌ Defund rural clinics and hospitals, putting as many as 8 rural hospitals in New Mexico at risk

❌ Strip coverage from children, seniors, and working families just to fund tax breaks for billionaires

We’ve seen what these cuts would mean—because I’ve heard it directly from New Mexicans.
📍In Springer, El Centro clinic staff told me what’s at stake if Medicaid protections vanish

📍In Cuba, we opened new housing for providers so we can keep doctors in our communities

📍In Raton, Miners Colfax Medical Center is the only OB provider within 100 miles—and it could be the first service to go

📍In Clayton, a mother told me how Medicaid keeps her and her son alive—without it, they’d be left behind

📍In Portales, Roosevelt General serves a community where one-third rely on Medicaid. Cuts would increase uncompensated care

📍In Roswell, Eastern NM Medical Center delivers 180,000 annual visits across a medically underserved region. It’s already stretched thin.

'1936136236873531631',"It would be incredibly dangerous for Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. I am concerned that the current war could rapidly spiral into a broader war in the Middle East, with grave consequences for regional stability and American lives.

But let’s be clear: the authority to declare war belongs solely to the United States Congress. President Trump does not have congressional approval to take offensive military action against Iran.

That’s why I’ve signed onto the bipartisan War Powers resolution to prohibit U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran war without congressional approval.

I have called on Speaker Johnson to immediately reconvene the House to respond to possible military action in Iran. He must also immediately convene a classified congressional briefing on the escalating conflict.

But let’s remember how we got here: although imperfect, the Obama administration negotiated a nuclear agreement that successfully and verifiably prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. President Trump recklessly withdrew from that deal, removing restrictions and giving Iran a green light to resume its nuclear ambitions.

We must work with our allies to pursue a diplomatic resolution—one that ends Iran’s nuclear program and makes sure it cannot threaten Israel or regional peace.
