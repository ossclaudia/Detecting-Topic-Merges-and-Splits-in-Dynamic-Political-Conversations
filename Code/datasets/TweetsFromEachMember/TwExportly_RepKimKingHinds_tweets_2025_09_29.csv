But the Covenant is more than just a historic document—it’s a living commitment.

To me, it’s both an ideal and a tool, one that survives through our actions and advocacy. It reminds us that our unique identity within the United States must be continually protected and uplifted.

As we mark 49 years since the signing, it’s up to us to give life to this agreement, to defend our rights, and to stay true to the principles of self-government and self-determination—even when it’s hard.

Here’s to honoring the past, meeting the moment, and continuing to define our future.

'1889810042926313783',"My colleagues in the @HouseVetAffairs today were debating whether or not we should have direct or community care for our veterans. Choosing between where to receive care...I wish we had that problem.

The CNMI doesn't even have options. We have ONE doctor in Saipan that sees patients two times a week. The nearest VA hospital is in Hawai'i, which is nearly 4,000 miles away. Often, many of our veterans that are on a fixed income have to pay out of pocket to travel to get healthcare and then wait months to be reimbursed.

Let's ensure that ALL veterans, regardless of their zip code, get the healthcare they deserve. Being from a territory doesn't make us any less American.",en,Tweet,1,6,0,1,221,2025-02-12 22:53:19,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1889807731877367808/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/5ViOblf6OYLI-1gP.mp4?tag=12
