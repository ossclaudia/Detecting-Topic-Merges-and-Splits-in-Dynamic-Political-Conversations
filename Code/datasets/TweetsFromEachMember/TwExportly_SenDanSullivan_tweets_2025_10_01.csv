'1960105315170738242',"The strategic importance of Alaska has been demonstrated time and time again this summer. Just in the last few days, there have been two Russian incursions into our airspace, which our Alaska-based military, once again, professionally intercepted and sent packing back to Russia. Additionally, our military and Coast Guard have been closely monitoring Chinese vessels in the Arctic Ocean near our EEZ that are supposedly conducting research—potentially as a cover for more nefarious objectives. But most importantly, all branches of our military and some allied partners, have been conducting two important military exercises in our state throughout August—Arctic Edge and Northern Edge—to train homeland security, combat readiness, and power projection capabilities in the Arctic and Indo-Pacific in the event of a major contingency with one of our adversaries.

The training in Alaska of our military, particularly the Joint Pacific-Alaska Range Complex (JPARC), is unrivaled anywhere in the world. As part of this exercise and challenging training, top uniformed and civilian leaders have come to Alaska, including INDOPACOM Commander Admiral Sam “Pappy” Paparo, NORTHCOM Commander Greg “Clete” Guillot, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Chris Grady, and importantly the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment, the Honorable Dale Marks, whose portfolio is critical to Alaska. I‘ve traveled around the state with these fine military officers and leaders—including visits to JBER, Fort Greely, and meetings with the 11th Airborne Division—to watch the outstanding training throughout Alaska this month. I want to thank all of them for being up here and, in particular, thank Admiral Grady, who will be retiring in September after 42 years of Naval service to our great nation.

We discussed all kinds of important issues for Alaska and our nation, including plans to reopen the naval base at Adak on the Aleutian Island Chain, Alaska energy for our forces, and the importance of increased Naval and Marine Corps presence and operations in Alaska. In that regard, I had the opportunity to fly out to the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) carrier strike group off the coast of Alaska, which is participating in Northern Edge. It is remarkable and humbling to watch a carrier strike group in operation knowing that the average age of the over 5,000 sailors and Marines on the USS Abraham Lincoln—one of the great instruments of American power—is about 23 years old. These brave service members are conducting important operations that establish credible deterrence in the North Pacific and help mold the sailors and aviators of the strike group into the most lethal force on planet earth.

'1957207773386801320',"Pursuing peace is difficult, complicated, and risky. The Trump administration is spending much political capital and taking risks for peace. Since Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, I have been a strong supporter of Ukraine, including by providing weapons to Ukraine and our NATO allies and hitting Russia with severe sanctions. I want to commend President Trump and his entire team for the relentless time and energy they have put into trying to stop the slaughter in Ukraine launched by the dictator, Putin—like they are doing in so many other places in the world: Azerbaijan and Armenia, Cambodia and Thailand, Israel and Iran, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, Serbia and Kosovo, and, of course, the Abraham Accords.

I also want to thank President Trump and his team for taking the time to meet with me, my wife, Julie, our entire delegation, and the governor.

Despite this, the President and his team—including Secretary of State Rubio, Secretary of Defense Hegseth, Secretary of Commerce Lutnick, Secretary of the Treasury Bessent, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Caine, and the Supreme Allied Commander General Grynkewich—all took the time to meet with me when they touched down in our great state. That was much appreciated.

Finally, to my fellow Alaskans—so many of whom worked so hard on security for the Alaska Summit and on welcoming people and media from all over the world to our state—we have much to be proud of from the Alaska Summit. Thank you and congratulations on showing the world what a great state we live in and just how strategically vital we are for America’s national and energy security. In particular, I want to thank our remarkable Alaska-based military and law enforcement. You were given an incredibly important mission on a short time frame. And whether it was undertaking security operations for the world leaders at the Alaska Summit, staging our world-class military assets—like dozens of 5th generation fighters—for all the world to see, or conducting well-timed flyovers to demonstrate to our adversaries the might of the U.S. military, you all conducted this important mission flawlessly. I took a video of this flyover which included our Alaska-based F-35s and a B-2, and was honored to later meet with the B-2 pilots who conducted it.

'1956902826602578358',"This year, Juneau has experienced a record level of flooding from the annual glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) down the Mendenhall River—over 16.5 feet—topping last year’s record of 15.99 feet. In light of these serious challenges and the threat to the lives and property of Alaskans, I have been very focused on getting federal dollars and a workable enduring plan from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to fix this annual challenge in one of our biggest cities. Like I did in the aftermath of last year’s Juneau flood, I wanted to assess the damage as soon as possible this summer and begin the important work on a durable engineering solution to this problem, which is why I spent all day in Juneau today.
 
This morning, I took a helicopter tour of Mendenhall Glacier and the flood zone. I then participated in a very detailed briefing and roundtable discussion with the Unified Command team, including the City and Borough of Juneau, the Central Council of the Tlingit-Haida, the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Coast Guard, the Forest Service, the National Weather Service, and the State of Alaska. I want to commend everyone in the community for their incredible coordination, which no doubt saved lives.
 
Regarding next steps, the Corps is a critical partner in both the short-term and in the long-term, enduring solution. That is why, at my request, the recently confirmed Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Adam Telle, sent his top leadership for the Pacific Ocean Division—Brigadier General Goetz—to be on the ground immediately to see the situation for himself. Earlier this year, Assistant Secretary Telle committed to me to expedite a solution for Juneau—not simply accepting another 10 years of studies. The HESCO barriers that were donated by the Corps have overall proven to be a “wild success,” according to the city and the Corps, saving an estimated 1,000 homes from being flooded—but they didn’t work perfectly. 
 
I truly want to commend USACE Brigadier General Goetz and Command Sergeant Major Zachary Plummer for their outstanding work, and all the time they have spent in the last week on the ground in Juneau, providing reassurance to the citizens of our capital city. I also want to thank Assistant Secretary Telle for already keeping his commitment to me that he would focus his senior team’s efforts on helping Juneau. 
 
I look forward to continue working with all of the stakeholders in Juneau and the Corps to expedite a long-term solution for this community, leveraging the important provisions in President Trump’s Day One executive order, Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential, which gives the Corps extraordinary powers to work on important Alaska projects, like this one.",en,Tweet,0,11,2,10,1828,2025-08-17 03:16:06,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1956897850966626304/vid/avc1/1280x720/LdBOePDWKF5SW8xa.mp4?tag=21

'1939786798227759494',"Sounds like some far-left dishonest liberals are in a tizzy over my telling of the facts of what is going on in D.C. right now. Here again are the facts:

During a debate of a budget reconciliation bill, which we are involved with right now, the parliamentarian of the Senate rules on whether provisions violate the so-called Byrd rule. But the Byrd rule is not self-executing. The parliamentarian does not scrub the bill to look for violations. Bill provisions must be challenged by Democrat leadership for her to rule on whether a provision violates the Byrd rule.

Democrats in the Senate, led by Chuck Schumer, are challenging every single provision in this bill that would benefit Alaska. The most notorious, as I mentioned last night, is my provision that I’ve been working on for years to increase the federal match for Medicaid for Alaska, which was in the bill and supported by all Republicans and the White House, and would’ve provided Alaska hundreds of millions of dollars more a year in federal Medicaid money. Far-left-wing affiliated Democrat groups are running blatantly false attack ads against me in Alaska saying this bill would cut Medicaid and Medicare benefits in Alaska. This is false.

But here is an undeniable fact: The only people cutting Medicaid for Alaskans right now—hundreds of millions of dollars each year from the federal government—are Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats. Period.

They also challenged a provision of mine that made it into the budget reconciliation bill to increase funding for rural hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii. Schumer and the Democrats challenged that and successfully stripped it out yesterday, trying to hurt rural hospitals in Alaska. But we will continue to fight the anti-Alaska Democrats in the Senate.

Here are just a few of the other things Schumer and the Senate Democrats have challenged with the parliamentarian that were in the budget reconciliation bill that would dramatically help Alaska. Remember, this is a fact: Schumer and the Senate Democrats are trying to rip all these things out of the budget reconciliation bill to harm Alaskans.

➡️ ANWR leases
➡️ NPR-A leases
➡️ Cook Inlet leases
➡️ Coast Guard funding for Alaska, including facilities for the new icebreaker home-ported in Juneau
➡️ Potential Arctic military bases
➡️ Border security
➡️ Charitable deductions for Alaska whaling communities
➡️ Greater flexibility for SNAP requirements

We are fighting Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats on every front when they come after the interests of Alaska and our citizens.",en,Tweet,14,173,61,57,9626,2025-06-30 21:43:06,"<a href=""https://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TweetDeck Web App</a>",,,,

Unfortunately, this is part of the Senate Democrats’ continuing assault on so many of the positive provisions for Alaska in the budget reconciliation bill. The following provisions—that we are fighting to keep in the final bill—have all been fought by Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats to strip out of the bill:

'1939066907312955734',"A lot going on in the Senate right now, but it is always important to remember our fallen heroes. Twenty years ago, I was a Marine serving as a staff officer to the CENTCOM Commander. We had landed at night in Afghanistan—Bagram Air Base—and were immediately taken to a SCIF to be briefed on “Operation Red Wings,” which was an ongoing operation that ended in tragedy. I only found out later that my friend, a Navy SEAL, LCDR Erik Kristensen—who I was trying to link up with at Bagram—was one of our fallen heroes that day. What a terrible loss for the Navy and America.

I am so heartened and proud that the midshipmen of the U.S. Naval Academy—where I am honored to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Visitors—keep the memory of this brave American hero alive. Watch the video. Semper Fi, Erik!

Additionally, DOI’s order today lifts land withdrawals along the Dalton Highway Corridor, which contains the lifeblood of Alaska—the Trans-Alaska Pipeline—and allows those lands to be conveyed to the State of Alaska, securing this vital artery for future resource development, including access to the Ambler Mining District and the right-of-way for a future Alaska LNG pipeline.

'1877089237406986341',"This is no surprise. From Day 1, Joe Biden and Deb Haaland have sought to illegally shut down any chance of developing ANWR and have said as much. They and their eco-colonialist allies have made every effort to delay, and ultimately kill, any chance of successful ANWR lease sales and have canceled the voices of the Iñupiat Native people of Alaska in the process. This latest lease sale was yet another attempt to circumvent the federal law Congress passed and President Trump signed mandating two lease sales in ANWR. Closing off nearly 75 percent of the 1002 area, including lands that are projected to have substantial resources beneath them, is clearly an attempt to stymie interest from industry. Don’t forget: Companies had already witnessed the Biden-Harris administration brazenly and illegally cancel leases from the first sale.

'1866262426036981927',"The Biden-Harris administration’s eleventh-hour lease sale in ANWR is yet another charade aimed at subverting the will of Congress in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 

The Biden Interior Department is proposing a lease sale that closes three-quarters of the 1002 Area—including lands that are projected to have substantial resources beneath them—after having previously cancelled all of the leases lawfully-issued under the first statutorily mandated lease sale. 

But the most insulting aspect of BLM’s announcement today is the agency’s claim to have ‘consulted with Alaska Native Tribes and Corporations’ on this Record of Decision. Having spoken with the leaders of these entities, I can report that nothing is further from the truth. The Biden-Harris administration has never given any weight to the voices of the Alaska Native people in the region who strongly support responsible resource development in ANWR for the benefit of their communities—just like the Biden-Harris administration refused to even meet with Alaska Native leaders when promulgating their illegal NPR-A rule. Cancelling Alaska Native voices continues under the Biden-Harris administration, but don’t hold your breath for the mainstream media to write that story. 

The good news is we will soon be working with the Trump administration which, unlike Biden-Harris, has a proven track record of responsible oil and gas production and Alaska resource development, and respects the voices of the Iñupiat people of the North Slope.",en,Tweet,5,170,43,21,17320,2024-12-09 23:23:30,"<a href=""https://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TweetDeck Web App</a>",,,,

For Alaskans, the choice in this election was particularly stark, and in my view it wasn’t even a close call. President Trump and his Administration were an incredible partner to Alaska, listening to our concerns, taking actions to promote economic opportunity and good paying jobs, and putting Alaskans in the driver’s seat of our state’s destiny. Under the Biden-Harris administration, with strong help from Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Alaska sustained an unprecedented onslaught of negative, unwarranted federal actions —treatment no other state has ever experienced. With 67 executive orders and actions targeting our state, the Biden-Harris administration has sought to unravel the progress we achieved under the Trump administration by locking up our lands, killing our jobs, and harming our economy, all the while ignoring the voices of Alaskans and even defying federal law.

As I did eight years ago, I will be working closely with President Trump, his administration, and my Senate colleagues to seize the opportunities before us, advance the interests and priorities of Alaskans, and make America stronger and more prosperous than ever before.

This was a contentious and often heated campaign with strong, sincere feelings on both sides of the aisle. While we may disagree at times on what policies are best for our country, we should never forget that we are all Americans.",en,Tweet,1,86,11,65,4597,2024-11-06 20:16:22,"<a href=""https://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TweetDeck Web App</a>",,,,
