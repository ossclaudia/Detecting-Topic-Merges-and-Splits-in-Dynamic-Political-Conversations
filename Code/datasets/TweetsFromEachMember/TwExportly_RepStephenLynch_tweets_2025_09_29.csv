'1938244343803851140',"I have participated in both of the successful investigations and impeachments of President Trump. I also voted for impeachment in each case. As you may recall, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats controlled the House in both the prior Trump impeachments. As a result, Democrats controlled the impeachment process.

However, right now the Republicans are in control of the House of Representatives. Instead of Speaker Pelosi, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), a Trump lapdog, is the presiding officer in the House. Therefore, under the Rules of the House any Democratic effort to present Articles of impeachment against President Trump in the current Republican-controlled House will be required to be presented to the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) who is also a shameless tool for the current President.

As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Jordan will control the entire impeachment process. Mr. Jordan will have the power to subpoena friendly witnesses, and to discredit any evidence against Trump. Mr. Jordan will control the voting process, and he will control the result in which the Republican majority will no doubt find Trump innocent of all charges.

Ultimately because the Republicans have a significant majority on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Jordan will be able to refuse to send the Articles of Impeachment to the floor so that Mr. Green’s resolution will never be voted on in the House. It will be dead on arrival. A fool’s errand.

Anyone who tells you differently has a poor understanding of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives. Plain and simple.

As a member of the House @OversightDems , which has been included as a Committee of jurisdiction during past impeachments, I firmly believe that our investigative time and resources are much better spent conducting extensive oversight of the Trump Administration and preparing an investigative record that will be primed and ready for a Democratic majority to hold President Trump fully accountable when we retake the majority in the midterm elections 17 months from now.

Our House Democratic Litigation and Rapid Response Task Force is also supporting more than 280 lawsuits filed by State Attorneys General, federal employee unions, pro-democracy and civil rights advocates, and other organizations against the Trump Administration.  To date, federal courts nationwide have issued nearly 200 court orders to block or suspend unlawful Trump Administration actions.

Democrats have a number of ongoing investigations into the blatantly wrongful conduct on the part of President Trump, his family, his business partners and his Administration including his self-dealing and cryptocurrency schemes, his sale of government access and services as well as his acceptance of payments and emoluments from foreign leaders. The list of offenses continues to grow.

For those of you who have sent messages or have called my office, I understand your frustration and your desire for “impeachment now”. However, as I described above, to do so with the Republicans in charge of the impeachment process would be a colossal failure, a wasted opportunity and a gift to President Trump and his henchmen.

The bill proposed by House Republican Leadership and backed by President Trump to extend government funding does not include the funding previously deemed necessary to fully fund benefits for our servicemembers. 
 
I stand in support of our Seniors and families who rely on Medicaid—this bill threatens more than $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid, with Elon Musk saying just yesterday that spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs is “the big one to eliminate.”
 
This bill slashes funding for healthcare and medical research programs—including Cancer and Alzheimer’s research—administered by the National Institutes of Health, by nearly $300 million.  It also cuts rent subsidies for low-income families by over $700 million in the midst of an affordable housing shortage of more than 7 million homes and shortchanges programs that provide emergency food assistance to Seniors.  
 
So I voted NO.
 
This bill harms the hardworking people of the Massachusetts 8th Congressional District, our elderly, and our veterans. We must set politics aside and enact a government funding bill that reflects bipartisan negotiation and the priorities of the American people.",en,Tweet,1,34,5,18,1787,2025-03-12 02:17:59,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

It has never been an American tradition to punch down at the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. And we have never abandoned our veterans. We honor them. Until now. 
 
In the first weeks of this administration, Donald Trump fired 2,400 VA employees. These were healthcare attendants and benefit specialists who handle the millions of disability claims that came in from Veterans and their families. Trump even cut personnel from the VA Suicide Crisis Hotline in the middle of an ongoing crisis among our Veterans. 
 
And let us not forget—Veterans benefits are special. We are talking about benefits that are owed for services rendered. Each of these veterans has honorably and courageously fulfilled their obligation to our country and in many, many cases they bear the scars, visible and invisible, as a result of that service.
 
Today we have a backlog of 250,000 cases at the VA, which means months of waiting for those Veterans who are waiting for treatment or benefits or both. And now Trump has just announced plans to fire at least 80,000 more employees at the VA. That is shameful, especially considering that 27% of employees at the VA are Veterans themselves. Trump and Musk have stabbed our Veterans in the back.",en,Tweet,3,72,22,29,4439,2025-03-06 21:53:30,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
