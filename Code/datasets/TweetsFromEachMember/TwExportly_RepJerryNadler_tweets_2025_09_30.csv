Now they are trying to punish New Yorkers by removing the MTA from any role in shaping the future of Penn Station.

Let me be clear. The MTA just completed the first major improvements to Penn Station in decades, and they did it on time and under budget. Claiming they are unfit to continue this work is not about performance, it is about politics.

More than two-thirds of Penn Station’s riders come through the MTA system. The priority in any rehabbed Penn Station, which I've been working on must benefit the riding public.  That means Amtrak Users, MTA LIRR and NJ Transit Commuters and subway riders. Any serious plan to improve the station must include the MTA at the table, not excluded because Donald Trump has a personal grudge against public transit and the people of New York.",en,Tweet,1,45,18,25,3861,2025-04-17 22:58:14,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

The irony is not lost on me that the Trump Administration— that already contains antisemites in its ranks— is seeking to add a divisive figure like Rabbi Kaploun as its antisemitism czar.

Let’s not forget that Rabbi Kaploun is the same Trump campaign official who false claimed that President Biden, “won’t even make a statement about combating anti-Semitism.” This insulting statement couldn’t be farther from the truth. Have we all forgotten in these past months that it was the Biden Administration that developed and released the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism? Have we forgotten that President Biden would regularly invoke the antisemitism of the Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville as the very reason he returned to public life to seek higher office?

According to reports, Rabbi Kaploun also helped organize the event at which Trump claimed that if he were to lose the election, the “the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss”— a textbook example of antisemitic scapegoating. At that same event, Trump made another antisemitic and conspiratorial comment, claiming that Democrats somehow had a “hold or curse” on American Jews.

Perhaps most offensively, Rabbi Kaploun publicly claims that after October 7th, “Democrats refuse to even recognize the butchers of women and kidnappers of children as terrorists.” This absurd and insulting claim does not deserve a response.

'1902482852312445186',"I am deeply disturbed by Prime Minister Netanyahu’s decision to abandon the ceasefire agreement, return to war, and welcome Itamar Ben Gvir back into the government as Minister of National Security. This choice puts the safety of the remaining hostages, including American citizens, at grave risk, and will make an already desperate situation for Gazan civilians substantially worse.
 
The return to war will not bring Israel greater security, nor is it likely to achieve Netanyahu’s stated goal of fully eradicating Hamas. It will bring a greater level of stability to Netanyahu’s government and allows him to continue to attempt to defer the day he faces final judgment in court. There are simply too many lives at stake. The United States must impress clearly to all parties the need for the immediate return of the hostages, a lasting ceasefire agreement, and a constant and consistent flow of humanitarian aid.
 
Today’s actions are a step backward for all who seek an enduring peace in the region. I urge all parties and the international community to do everything in their power to bring calm and stability to the region as quickly as possible.
