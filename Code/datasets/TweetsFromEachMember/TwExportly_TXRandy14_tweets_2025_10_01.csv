'1946288510648168461',"Some of my colleagues in Congress want to support amnesty. Let me be very clear: I do not support amnesty.

Mass amnesty is NOT the answer to solving America’s illegal immigration crisis. For four years, the Biden Administration abused every loophole possible, such as expanding Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Humanitarian Parole, to wave millions of illegal immigrants into this country, effectively granting backdoor amnesty and putting American lives at risk.

We’ve seen the consequences: crime, chaos, and tragedy that led to the deaths of innocent Americans at the hands of illegal aliens.

Our Constitution is clear; if you want to become an American citizen, FOLLOW THE LAW.

Thankfully, President Trump is once again leading the charge to shut down the border and clean up our communities, especially from criminal illegal aliens. And once we get the chaos under control and restore the rule of law, then and only then can we have real conversations about long-term immigration solutions.

Protecting our borders and the principles of American citizenship are what allow us to maintain our sovereignty, and I fight every day to defend the American people from those who attempt to undermine what it means to be an American.",en,Tweet,0,10,2,5,530,2025-07-18 20:18:35,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1931021793529110691',"Eighty-one years ago, to this day, the young and most vital of our nation stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, to liberate the European Continent from authoritarian fascism. As these young men meticulously prepared for their invasion, they recognized the hardship and sacrifice that lay ahead. Nevertheless, the young men understood the importance of defending the traditions of individuality and freedom in the West; that is why, when confronted with insurmountable odds on the beaches of Omaha and Utah, these young men and their commanders refused to turn back, instead running forward into the breach carrying a beacon of hope and freedom to the world. 

We shall never forget what took place that day and the heroes who took part. We will continue to honor their courage and sacrifice against all odds. Particularly the bravery of young Texans from the 14th District, whose actions continue to serve as an example of perseverance and hope today. Here are two quotes from folks in Southeast Texas during D-Day. 

 “As the sky lightened, the armada became visible. The smoking and burning French shoreline also became more defined. At 0600, the huge guns of the Allied navies opened up with what must have been one of the greatest artillery barrages ever. The diesels on board our craft failed to muffle the tornadic blasting. I could see the TEXAS firing broadside into the coastline. Boom-ba-ba-boom-ba-ba-boom! Within minutes, giant swells from the recoil of those guns nearly swamped us and added to the seasickness and misery. But one could also actually see the two-thousand-pound missiles tumbling on their targets.” – Sergeant Robert Bixler, 116th Infantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division.

“The ramp was lowered immediately after the rockets fired. It was our hope and desire to run right up on the beach for a dry landing, not because we were afraid of getting wet but because if we were soaked it would be added weight to carry while climbing. The British Navy man had promised to put us down dry, but suddenly we ran aground with the ramp dropped. The officer said, ‘Everybody out.’ Looking ahead, I could see fifteen or twenty feet of water, a muddy dirty gray stretch. The Entire area was marked by craters, shell holes from the guns on the TEXAS and the bombers.” – Lieutenant George Kerchner, 2nd Ranger Battalion.",en,Tweet,0,8,0,6,400,2025-06-06 17:14:06,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
