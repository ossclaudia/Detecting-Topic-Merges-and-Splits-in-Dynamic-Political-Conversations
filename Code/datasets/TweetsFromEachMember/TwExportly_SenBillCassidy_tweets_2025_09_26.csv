'1940087116853084295',"Cassidy Stands with President Trump, Passes One Big Beautiful Bill

WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) today released the following statement after voting to pass President Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill.

“President Trump and I want to preserve the American Dream for working and middle America,” said Dr. Cassidy. “We keep taxes low, cut taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security, extend the Child Tax Credit, fix our broken education system, support our military, secure our border, and build a business environment that creates better paying jobs - especially in Louisiana.”

As chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, Cassidy led the Committee’s portion of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill, which fixes America’s broken higher education system and addresses the root causes of the student debt crisis.

Cassidy pushed to secure provisions in this historic legislation that:
- Make higher education more affordable by eliminating inflationary loan programs that have resulted in higher tuition costs.
- Prevent taxpayer-subsidized loans for degrees that leave students worse off than if they never went to college.
- Reform the current federal student loan program that transfers debt onto the 87 percent of Americans who chose to not go to college or already paid off their loans.
- Ensure low-income Americans can access higher education by strengthening Pell Grants and addressing the program’s budget shortfall. As it currently stands, the Pell Grant program faces a mounting budget shortfall that threatens its future.
- Expand education freedom and opportunity for students by providing a charitable donation incentive for individuals and businesses to fund scholarship awards for students to cover expenses related to K-12 public and private education.
- Increase access to career or technical-based education for low-income students by establishing Workforce Pell Grants. This is crucial to achieving President Trump’s goal of bringing skilled jobs back to America from China and Mexico.
- Boost U.S. manufacturing and crack down on China and other countries abusing our trade loopholes (de minimis). In 2023, Cassidy introduced similar legislation.
- Provide beauty industry small businesses with access to the tip credit, which would create jobs.
- Eliminate the $200 tax stamp for short-barreled firearms.
- Raise the annual cap on offshore energy revenue sharing with Gulf states from $500 million to $650 million through 2034.
- Require the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to hold no fewer than two lease sales every year for fifteen years in the Central and Western areas of the Gulf of America—something the Biden administration refused to do.
- Invest $389 million in America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to bolster U.S. energy security.
- Unleash American energy by allowing energy companies to deduct costs, including labor and safety, associated with oil and gas exploration.
- Expand access to direct primary care arrangements by allowing the use of Health Savings Account (HSA) dollars to pay for such services.

WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) issued the following statement after the release of the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds annual report examining how much longer these programs can pay full benefits promised to taxpayers without significant benefit cuts. The report states that Social Security will become insolvent in 2033, forcing an automatic 23% benefit cut for all current and future beneficiaries. The Medicare Trust Fund will become insolvent in 2033, three years earlier than previously predicted.

“In eight years, millions of Americans who rely on Social Security and Medicare will be left stranded if Washington does nothing,” said Dr. Cassidy. “If we borrow to pay for benefits, we will rack up hundreds of trillions of dollars in debt. Congress must do everything we can to address a cliff we all see coming.”",en,Tweet,2,8,3,27,2679,2025-06-18 22:51:24,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

1. We are wasting taxpayer dollars to pay federal employees top salaries to ""live"" in higher-cost cities and not show up to work. Ridiculous.
2. SSA is already backlogged. It takes up to 12 months to process disability cases. Sadly, it is not shocking considering employees can work from the beach. Americans deserve better!
3. The U.S. Government Accountability Office has identified 6 federal agencies, including SSA, that were on average 91% vacant. Taxpayers are paying to keep these buildings lit and heated for whom? Unacceptable.

It's time for federal employees to return to the office. Get off the couch and start serving the American people again!
