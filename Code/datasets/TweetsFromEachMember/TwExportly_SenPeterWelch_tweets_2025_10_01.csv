'1952400885742477484',"This July, I introduced bills that focus on lowering costs for working families, improving the disaster recovery process for communities, increasing health care access for patients, and giving our farmers and small business owners a fair shot. 
 
On the anniversaries of the July 2023 and 2024 Vermont floods, I introduced the Disaster AID Act.  It cuts red tape at FEMA so assistance can be distributed more quickly and efficiently to towns hit by flooding, wildfires, tornadoes, or other weather catastrophes. 

I reintroduced the Rural Recovery Act, which provides local USDA Rural Development offices with funding to help rural communities recover after a natural disaster. 

Big Pharma is abusing the patent system to keep prices high, making patients pay more for the prescriptions they need.  I led a bipartisan, bicameral bill to make it easier for more affordable generic and biosimilar drugs to enter the market.  

For our servicemembers, I’m working to prohibit the use of open-air burn pits that have caused life-long health issues for some of our veterans and improve how the burn bit registry can be updated. 
 
The 340B program is a lifeline that helps rural hospitals and health centers access affordable prescription drugs and expand their services.  I introduced legislation to thwart Big Pharma’s push to cut back on the program.  
 
President Trump has been waging an unnecessary and volatile trade war against Canada, the largest trading partner to Vermont and 33 other states.  I introduced a bill to exempt small business owners from the painful tariffs being placed on our northern neighbor.  

Right now, AI companies can build their models without sharing how they're doing it. I reintroduced legislation that gives musicians, writers, and other artists a legal pathway to learn if the work they own is being used by AI companies without proper consent or compensation.  

The so-called ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ was really one giant handout to Big Pharma and sells out folks using Medicaid.  I led an effort to repeal new out-of-pocket expenses placed on care for our seniors, children, and people with disabilities, and close the loophole that lets drug companies charge more.  

The smaller the farm, the more challenging it is for a dairy farmer to earn and stay recognized as an organic producer.  I reintroduced the O DAIRY Act to provide a safety net for small organic producers facing heavy losses and collect data to help them prepare for the future.

'1948138077492301890',"Let me tell you an example about how President Trump has decimated the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and how his Administration's priorities mean the rollback of justice in this country.

For more than 20 years, Lowndes County in Alabama has been plagued by old septic systems that can't handle the weather. When it rains, raw sewage backs up into toilets, into bathtubs, and floods yards. Residents can't drink the tap water. One in every three residents has the intestinal parasite hookworm.

Lowndes County is 72% Black.

In 2023, the Civil Rights Division under President Biden investigated and found evidence that the Alabama Department of Public Health knew about the health risks from the exposure to raw sewage and did nothing.

To right this wrong, the Biden Administration allocated nearly $26 million to rebuild the county's infrastructure and reached an agreement to help Lowndes’ residents.

But earlier this year, President Trump cut the funding. His new head of the Civil Rights Division, Harmeet Dhillon, said the department will ""no longer push 'environmental justice' as viewed through a distorting, DEI lens.""

President Trump has gutted the Civil Rights Division of career attorneys who served under Presidents of both parties. The division is the chief enforcer of voting rights, of racial justice, of hate crimes, and more.

'1939800371171361211',"Republicans are on the brink of making the biggest cut to Medicaid in history. Here’s what happens when you kick 17 million people off their health care:

When people lose their health care, they stop going to the doctor for check ups. When they stop getting check ups, they miss diagnoses of diseases that are treatable if caught early. More people will get sick and die.

When people can’t go to the doctor for minor issues, they end up using the emergency room instead. It drives up emergency room wait times even longer than they already are, and if patients can’t afford to pay, it puts more stress on hospitals’ finances.

Two out of three beds in nursing homes are paid for by Medicaid. When you slash Medicaid, seniors get kicked out of nursing homes and those facilities can’t stay open to care for the patients who can pay. One in four nursing homes are projected to close.

Rural hospitals rely on Medicaid payments from patients. When you cut Medicaid, those payments go away and rural hospitals close. That means if you’re in a rural community, that 30-minute drive to the hospital might turn into an hour or more. If you’re in an emergency, that’s a terrifying reality. Hundreds of rural hospitals are projected to close.

This bill will destroy health care in America. We will have to reckon with the consequences for generations.",en,Tweet,2,29,12,7,1398,2025-06-30 22:37:02,"<a href=""https://sproutsocial.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Sprout Social</a>",,,,

'1936206682138308837',"Last week, Secretary Kennedy fired the entire the CDC vaccine advisory panel tasked with advising the government on who should receive which vaccines and when.

Let's take a look at who he appointed to replace them. 🧵 

Dr. Joseph R. Hibbeln, who has no professional track record at all with vaccines.

Martin Kulldorff objected to mass vaccinations for COVID-19, and himself neglected to get one. He was later dismissed by Mass General Brigham and fired from Harvard Medical School. He's also accepted over $30,000 in return for testifying against vaccines. 

Dr. Retsef Levi, a professor at MIT, has used his profile to call for the termination of COVID vaccines, wrongly claiming they caused a record number of deaths.  

Dr. Robert Malone claimed the American people got COVID-19 vaccinations because they were, in part, hypnotized. He inaccurately said some of those vaccinated then developed AIDS. 

Despite being on the FDA panel that approved COVID vaccines, Dr. Cody Meissner has argued repeatedly against children receiving them. He criticized children wearing masks during COVID, even though the practice saved lives.  

Dr. Michael A. Ross is an OB-GYN and a board member for a supplement company. He has no public vaccine experience at all. 

Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician, has no public professional experience with vaccines.

Finally, Vicky Pebsworth volunteered as a director for a medical group spreading widespread misinformation on vaccines. 

This panel is supposed to be made up of experts who use science to make recommendations that will keep the public safe.

'1932420238559027679',"I’m deeply troubled by the rise of antisemitism in America in the wake of the conflict in Gaza. Statistics show a sharp uptick in hate crimes against Jewish folks in America since October 2023. Those include hate crime incidents in my own state of Vermont, the tragic murder of two Israeli embassy workers in Washington, D.C., and now an attack on a peaceful assembly for hostages held by Hamas in Colorado.

No one deserves to be discriminated against because of who they are. Antisemitism is wrong. Islamophobia is wrong. I've traveled to both Israel and Palestine. I've met with Israelis who want the conflict to end, who believe that Netanyahu's actions are harmful and won't make their country safer. I've met with Palestinians who denounce Hamas and mourn the loss of Israelis along with the tens of thousands of civilians killed in Gaza.

I‘ve been one of the most outspoken Senators against what I believe has been a harmful war strategy by Netanyahu. I was one of the first Senators to call for a ceasefire in the months following Hamas’ horrendous attack on innocent people in Israel. I called for a ceasefire to prevent more loss of innocent life, free the remaining hostages, and to move toward a two-state solution.

I believe that Israel has a right to defend itself, but that Netanyahu has waged a reckless war campaign that disregards civilian life—including bombing aid workers and withholding humanitarian aid from reaching those who desperately need it.

Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu's actions doesn’t justify hate of our Jewish neighbors. Criticism of Hamas' actions doesn’t justify hate of our Palestinian neighbors.
