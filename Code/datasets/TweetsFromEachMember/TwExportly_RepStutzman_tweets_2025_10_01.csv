My new legislation, the Emergency Spending Accountability Act, will require the federal government to pay off the balance of future emergency spending by 20% each year for five years after funds are disbursed.

Money doesn’t grow on trees, just because an “emergency” arises doesn’t mean Congress should throw fiscal responsibility into the wind. Now is the time to hold Congress accountable, appropriate funding responsibly, and pay down our national debt.

Your pit crew, sponsors, and fans are counting on you to figure out what’s wrong and get back in the race.

So, you bring in the best mechanics in the business to inspect the car. They quickly uncover that:

1. The previous team sabotaged the engine with faulty parts.
2. Corrupt race officials have been taking kickbacks, allowing rival teams to bend the rules at your expense—all while your team struggles to stay competitive.

Now replace yourself driving the Indy 500 with Donald Trump navigating the federal government. 

The debt is increasing at an insurmountable rate, billions of dollars in payments are going out without knowing the true recipients, and everyone you ask for answers leads you to a dead end.
