Pope Francis personified our sacred responsibility in the Gospel of Matthew to honor the spark of divinity in the least of our brethren — championing the poor, the worker, the refugee and the immigrant. He reminded us of our inescapable duty to those struggling to escape poverty and persecution in our communities and around the world.  

Perhaps his most distinctive leadership will be his historic commitment to addressing the climate crisis. In his ground-breaking encyclical, Laudato Si, Pope Francis writes with beauty and clarity, with moral force and fierce urgency to call on all of us to be good stewards of God’s Creation.

Personally, the loss of Pope Francis is devastating.  It was my high honor to attend his installation on the Feast of Saint Joseph in 2013 and to be in the House chamber during his historic address to the Congress in 2015.

Americans continue to draw inspiration from his unshakable faith, extraordinary courage and unwavering vision for peace.

While our nation has forged important progress on the road to freedom for all of God’s children, today we are reminded of the urgent work ahead needed to defend our democracy.  Dr. King explained as he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize that because of his ‘abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in the future of mankind, [he] refuse[d] to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history.'
 
On this National Day of Service, we must refuse to accept despair by carrying on Dr. King's legacy of hope and recommitting our fight to secure the blessings of liberty for every American — and always striving to build a future worthy of Dr. King's glorious vision.  God truly bless America with the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",en,Tweet,25,1781,349,898,147836,2025-01-20 14:58:09,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ghvq5BZWEAAppme.jpg
'1879709913049399356',"President Joe Biden is one of the most consequential presidents in American history.  

With the wisdom and magnificent leadership of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, our nation has been graced by four historic years of progress, hope and unity for American families.  

Tonight, President Biden delivered his farewell address to a nation that is stronger because of his leadership.  In doing so, he honored the vision of founders, the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and the aspirations of our children.

With deep experience and with global relationships that are rivaled by none, President Biden has masterfully led America on the world stage.  

Under President Biden’s visionary leadership, America has been unequivocal in our commitment to defending Democracy here at home and around the world – and our NATO alliance is stronger and more unified than ever.  

America was fortunate to have a strong, steady, wise commander-in-chief honoring and promoting American values in the global arena.

President Biden and Vice President Harris, with the partnership of Democrats in Congress, have built a towering legacy of extraordinary achievement for the American people.  

They pulled our nation from the depths of the pandemic and ignited the strongest economic recovery in the world with our American Rescue Plan.  

They seized a once-in-a-century chance to rebuild our nation while investing in our middle class with our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  

With our CHIPS and Science Act, they declared America’s economic independence: powering a manufacturing boom, driving decades of scientific discovery and creating good-paying jobs across the country.  

They enacted America's first major gun violence prevention legislation in nearly three decades with our Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and took a monumental step toward fully honoring the service and sacrifice of our heroes in uniform with our PACT Act.  

With our Inflation Reduction Act, they honored our moral responsibility to save the planet while bringing down costs for working families by lowering prescription drug prices and energy bills.  

And our Respect for Marriage Act was a triumph of love, liberty and justice for all.

President Biden and Vice President Harris have earned their place in the pantheon of American democracy.  

Every American can be proud of the leadership and dignity they brought to the White House – and tonight, we again saw President Biden's great respect for America's remarkable history.  

With love and gratitude, I salute President Biden and Vice President Harris for always believing in the possibilities of America and building a stronger and fairer future for all of America's families.",en,Tweet,277,7783,1275,13427,990315,2025-01-16 01:59:01,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1843311826416611521',"One year ago, the world watched in horror as Hamas terrorists unleashed a monstrous assault on Israel. During their brutality on October 7th, Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people, including more than forty Americans, wounded thousands more, and kidnapped hundreds of civilian adults and children.

This horrific attack, orchestrated by a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of the State of Israel, was the deadliest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. Today and every day, we remember the victims of October 7th and the six hostages who have died in the year since, we keep their loved ones in our thoughts and continue praying for the release of all those still being held in captivity by Hamas terrorists.

America stands unwaveringly with the Israeli people and supports the right of Israel to defend herself. At the same time, our hearts break at the intolerable devastation and suffering of innocent civilians and families in Gaza. As we mark one year of this war, all sides must continue working to achieve a ceasefire and hostage deal on a path to a two-state solution with just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians.",en,Tweet,9,933,197,558,102359,2024-10-07 16:26:01,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
