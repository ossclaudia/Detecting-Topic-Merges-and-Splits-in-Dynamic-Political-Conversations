'1958945261449093456',"The Trump administration has failed to take meaningful action to support Americans experiencing homelessness. The decision to cut funding for the Housing First initiative—an evidence-based program that provides permanent housing for those experiencing chronic homelessness—is yet another harmful step. For years, Housing First has had bipartisan support, yet the executive chose to end it. This abrupt policy shift marks a troubling change in the federal government’s approach and will have serious consequences for communities across the country, especially in cities like Seattle, which has one of the highest homelessness rates in the nation. I strongly condemn this decision.

'1953120527884927205',"Yesterday, Secretary Kennedy made the decision to cut funding from 22 projects, including those dedicated to developing vaccines using mRNA technology. This type of research has been critical in fighting viruses such as COVID-19 and the flu, and without it, the toll of the pandemic would have been significantly worse.

This move is the latest in a series of reckless decisions by Secretary Kennedy, including the dismissal of key scientists, the rollback of vaccine recommendations, and a failure to respond effectively to the ongoing measles outbreak.

Cutting support for life-saving research is a deeply serious act that endangers the health and wellbeing of Americans and leaves us more vulnerable in the face of future pandemics.

'1950917843098169809',"William Galston’s op-ed in the Wall Street Journal acknowledges a hard truth: Hamas will never surrender. That truth underscores the urgent need for a fundamental shift in strategy. After nearly two years of war, it’s clear that the complete destruction of Hamas is not a feasible or sustainable goal and the cost of continuing to try is far too high.

Hamas is a terrorist organization and bears full responsibility for the horrific October 7 attacks. But continuing this war indefinitely, with devastating consequences for innocent Palestinian civilians, will not bring peace or security to Israel or the region.

There are Palestinians who reject Hamas’s violence and extremism and they must be empowered to lead. A new path forward is the only way to achieve long-term peace and security. The current course of continued military operations, displacement, and indefinite occupation risks even greater instability, can undermine key regional partnerships, and diminishes Israel’s moral and strategic standing.

It is time for an immediate ceasefire to address the humanitarian crisis and for Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire in exchange for the return of the remaining hostages. Israel must begin working with the United States, Arab partners, and the international community to support credible Palestinian alternatives to Hamas to govern Gaza and the West Bank.

We can continue to support Israel’s right to defend itself while recognizing that the military campaign has reached its limits. The time has come to shift from endless war to a political strategy that brings hostages home, delivers humanitarian relief, and builds the foundations for lasting peace. The United States must lead that effort.",en,Tweet,1,9,4,11,1121,2025-07-31 14:53:54,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GxMNbJEXgAE8w2k.jpg

'1948890306385973363',"Israel must take immediate action and work with all possible humanitarian aid organizations to rush critically needed food and other supplies to the people in Gaza. The level of the crisis there demands emergency action. Israel’s new arrangement on delivering aid simply is not working. Israel must take all possible steps to facilitate a surge of aid into Gaza. Additionally, the United Nations and other international aid organizations must work with Israel to resolve their differences and work together so all parties can maximize the capacity of humanitarian efforts.

It is unconscionable that Hamas continues to block a negotiated ceasefire, refusing both to surrender their illegitimate power in Gaza and to release the hostages that should never have been taken in the first place. It is also unconscionable that Hamas siphons off critically needed food and supplies intended for the people of Gaza and uses it instead to prop up their terrorist organization, while at the same time fighting their war against Israel by embedding themselves into the civilian population.

But given all of this, right now it falls to Israel to take the steps necessary to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe facing the civilian population in Gaza. I urge President Trump and his administration to work with Israel to implement a ceasefire and dramatically increase the flow of aid into Gaza. I believe we can both continue to support Israel in their effort to defend themselves against Hamas, Iran and others in the region who continue in their efforts to attack and destroy Israel, and work immediately to relieve the suffering of the people in Gaza.",en,Tweet,1,6,2,11,876,2025-07-26 00:37:12,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GwvYDhyWUAAq67-.jpg

'1940804612467864045',"“This bill is one of the most reckless and cruel legislative efforts I’ve seen in my career and it’s Washington families who would pay the price.

“It threatens the basic health care coverage that hundreds of thousands of people across our state depend on. It strips food assistance from tens of thousands of families. It raises energy costs, cuts clean energy jobs, and guts support for our public schools — all while giving billionaires a massive tax break and adding over $3 trillion to the debt.

“In our district, we know how critical programs like Apple Health and SNAP are to ensuring that families, seniors, and children can live with dignity. We know what happens when hospitals close, when energy bills spike, and when student debt becomes even more crushing. This bill would make all of that worse.

“Let’s be clear: none of this is necessary. These cuts aren’t about balancing the budget — this bill actually increases the debt and deficit by trillions. These cuts are about handing more power and more money to the wealthiest Americans while punishing working people. It’s cynical, it’s dangerous, and it’s wrong.

'1936616417383592230',"My statement on Trump ordering U.S. strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities:

I condemn in the strongest terms the President’s decision to order the U.S. military to strike Iran’s nuclear sites. The President did not seek authorization from Congress or demonstrate that Iran posed an immediate threat to the security of the United States. Furthermore, the President failed to provide clear objectives for these actions and there are no guarantees that it will eliminate the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon or how long it might set their program back.
 
Engaging in direct conflict places U.S. service members and military sites in the Middle East squarely in the crosshairs of Iran and its many proxies. Tonight’s actions could further escalate tensions, destabilize the region, and drag the United States into an avoidable war.

The way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and to protect American service members is through diplomacy and negotiation, not entering into direct conflict. The path that the President has chosen risks unleashing a wider war in the region that is both incredibly unpredictable and treacherous and that threatens the safety and security of the United States, Israel, and ultimately the world.",en,Tweet,116,4560,1412,1368,130350,2025-06-22 03:45:09,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

There must be an end to violence in the region and no individual should have to confront violence while seeking desperately needed humanitarian assistance.

Israel bears the responsibility to ensure that critically needed and long overdue aid makes it into Gaza reaching those who need it most. The Palestinian people are suffering horribly. Not nearly enough food and humanitarian assistance is being delivered to Gaza and effectively and safely distributed. This must be fixed immediately.

While it is a positive step that Israel lifted the blockade on aid to Gaza, the distribution of aid under this new plan seems haphazard and plagued by chaos and violence. The Israeli government must recognize these shortcomings and immediately fix their plan to stop the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and ensure aid is widely and safely delivered to Palestinian civilians. It is also of the utmost importance that Hamas and other actors are condemned for attempts to disrupt the distribution of aid.

Israel must take every opportunity to reduce tensions, improve access to aid, and prevent human suffering.

'1925544231285727436',"I strongly oppose the Republican budget bill. This bill would balloon the national debt, slash critical services, and deliver nearly $4.6 trillion in tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans. 

At a time when families are struggling with rising costs, Congress should be strengthening the programs that invest in American communities, not cutting them to pay for permanent tax breaks for billionaires. 

The legislation proposes deep cuts to essential programs that millions of Americans rely on. It slashes health care access for 13.7 million Americans, including children, seniors, and low-income families. It also cuts food assistance from over 42 million people across the country, including essential school lunch programs for hungry children.

These devastating cuts are an attempt to partially offset the revenue losses from massive tax breaks for corporations and ultra-high earners. Under this plan, the top 0.1% of earners—those making more than $4 million a year—would receive an average tax cut of nearly $390,000 in 2026 alone. Meanwhile, the lowest-income families could see their taxes go up or their benefits cut. This tax policy is unfair and deeply unsustainable. 

Despite these harmful cuts to essential services, the bill still increases the deficit by $3.3 trillion over the next decade, further weakening our fiscal stability just as American families are dealing with higher costs and economic uncertainty. If enacted, this bill would push the national debt to $56.8 trillion by 2034—or even higher if temporary provisions are extended, as many expect. The legislation also includes a $5.5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, not to invest in our future, but to finance tax cuts that benefit those who need them the least. 

This is not a serious or responsible budget. It asks working families, veterans, and students to sacrifice, while rewarding the ultra-wealthy with permanent giveaways. I believe we need a budget that protects essential services, invests in opportunity, and restores fiscal integrity—not one that shifts the burden onto those already struggling to get by. 

I’ll continue to fight for a fairer path forward—one that puts people first and reflects the values of the communities I serve.",en,Tweet,0,7,3,4,693,2025-05-22 14:28:14,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Grjnd_9XEAAqDAe.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrjnfbBW8AAGw85.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrjngTTWEAA1YSt.jpg"

'1918348810495091023',"In this current moment, there is a crucial opportunity to bring partners together to blunt the influence of Iran and other extremist groups like ISIS and bring stability to the region. I recently led a congressional delegation to the Middle East and saw firsthand that we have partners who are ready and willing to work with us and with Israel to achieve this goal. However, Israel's current actions in Syria, Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon run the risk of making these efforts at stability in the region much more difficult to achieve.

Israel is blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza, enabling rapid settlement expansion and settler violence in the West Bank, and delegitimizing the new governments in Lebanon and Syria with military operations. I understand that Israel must defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas and other Iranian proxies, but these extremist groups thrive in chaos and are able to recruit and gain support where populations in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria and Lebanon continue to suffer in active war zones. The only long-term hope is for stable governments to emerge in these places.

Israel must immediately allow humanitarian assistance back into Gaza. It should do far more to stop settler violence in the West Bank, and, crucially, it must work with Arab partners in the region to support Palestinian leadership that can be an alternative to Hamas and give all the Palestinian people some hope for the future. Additionally, Israel's continued attacks on and occupations of land in Lebanon and Syria threaten to undermine the fragile, fledgling efforts of each to build new peaceful and stable governments.

Bringing a coalition of partners together as a deterrence to Iran is the only way out of this cycle of regional conflict that has been devastating to the civilian population. Israel must immediately let humanitarian aid in, stop legitimizing settlements in the West Bank, and halt military actions that continue to contribute to the chaos in the region. Israel must change course or we risk losing this opportunity to achieve security and stability in the Middle East.",en,Tweet,0,0,1,0,187,2025-05-02 17:56:12,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gp9XwwhXUAAhUjm.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gp9Xx8NWYAAe-xM.jpg"

Instead, he has used the last 100 days in office to further divide the American people, commit retribution, cause more economic uncertainty, and threaten global stability. From firing nuclear safety employees to cutting cancer research funding, his choices have left Americans less safe.

'1887620253821104400',"I am deeply concerned by the role Elon Musk is playing in the Trump administration. The President has given Musk broad, sweeping power with no clear definition or boundary. Musk is using that power in ways both illegal and destructive.

He has blocked payments duly approved by Congress and signed into law by the President. This is illegal. He has completely shut down U.S. foreign aid, blocking payments of programs already approved that millions of people across the world are counting on for food security and health care among other needs. Agencies providing crucial services to people in desperate circumstances are headed into bankruptcy as a result of these funds being cut off.

He is also randomly threatening or firing thousands of government employees in ways that jeopardize their ability to do their jobs and may also violate employment law. Just days before the fatal plane crash in Washington D.C., Musk’s DOGE task force offered all FAA employees eight month’s pay in exchange for quitting, leaving them to wonder if they might be fired at some point if they didn’t accept the offer. Chaos, uncertainty and threats are making it impossible for federal employees to do their jobs in far too many instances.

I strongly support the idea of making government more efficient and more effective. Meaningful reform is needed, and Mr. Musk certainly has the background and experience to help accomplish these goals. He should focus on that and stop randomly terrorizing federal employees and illegally cutting off funds duly approved by Congress and being depended on by people in desperate need of help.",en,Tweet,0,6,3,8,1102,2025-02-06 21:51:53,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GjIsVJFWkAA74q4.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GjIsWMzXcAArL7A.jpg"

'1870140409151926436',"On September 6, Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi was fatally shot in the West Bank while she was peacefully participating in a demonstration against Israeli settlements in the Palestinian village of Beita. Since then, we have requested an independent, thorough, credible, and transparent investigation into what happened that day to both better understand the circumstances of her death and ensure that if any laws were broken, those who were responsible are held to account.

This week, Ms. Eygi’s family came to D.C. to discuss the challenges they've faced and the questions they still have about what happened. The lack of answers they have received is unacceptable.

We call on Israel to complete their investigation and release their report on the cause of her death. Secretary Blinken must insist on the release of any Israeli investigation results.  We also continue to urge the U.S. Department of Justice to initiate an independent, U.S.-led investigation into Ms. Eygi’s death. If the Justice Department isn’t going to investigate, then the State Department should release their own findings and seek accountability.

Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government have exacerbated tensions in the West Bank with their promotion of rapid Israeli settlement expansion. This dangerous situation in the West Bank has claimed the lives of far too many civilians, including Ms. Eygi.

We applaud the sanctions that President Biden has imposed thus far on extremist Israeli settlers, including the settler organization Amana. Clearly, more must be done.  The policies of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government undermine the viability of a Palestinian state and Israel’s security, violate the rights of Palestinians living in the West Bank, and put the region at even greater risk of further destabilization.

'1869940865332035586',"I voted against the partisan Republican proposal today because it was created solely to serve Musk and Trump, not the American people.

Trump and Musk are holding the U.S. government hostage to personally improve their standing. Musk intervened to protect himself from a China provision that would hurt his business interests. And Trump insisted on raising the debt ceiling so that he would be able to make a massive tax cut for billionaires and CEOs as soon as he gets into office in 2025.

The real tragedy here is that House Republicans are going along with this every step of the way. They have decided to protect Elon Musk’s business interests around China instead of funding childhood cancer research or improving child welfare services. They are prioritizing billionaires over substance-use disorder treatment, 9/11 responder and survivor health funding, workforce development programming, and seniors’ health and wellness services.

This failed bill cuts critical funding that working families are counting on, raises prescription drug costs for hardworking American taxpayers, and makes it easier for CEOs and billionaires to ship jobs overseas.

More than anything we are facing a shutdown because of Mike Johnson’s refusal to pass appropriations bills and fund the government the way it’s supposed to be funded. We should not be getting to the point where we need a Continuing Resolution to avoid a shutdown.

We should pass normal appropriations bills. But the reason we are not passing appropriations bills is the same reason that Mike Johnson allowed Trump and Musk to force forward their own self-interested proposal: he kowtows to the extreme, far-right MAGA Republicans in his conference.

We have the votes to pass normal appropriations bills and that should be our next step. I am deeply concerned that Johnson will not bring the appropriations bills up because MAGA extremists control him.

They set an example for working people everywhere – to fight for fair wages and benefits – and they were hugely successful. The deal that Machinists and Boeing came together last night to agree on delivers better benefits for Boeing workers, including a wage increase, stronger retirement plans, and other significant benefit improvements.
 
""I will always support the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain for better working conditions. I’m grateful today for the many leaders who rose to the occasion during these negotiations. Much is owed to Machinists President Job Holden, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, and the Biden-Harris Administration’s Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su for their expertise and leadership in this process.

""This new agreement should represent a new chapter for Boeing. For many decades, Boeing was a pillar of American innovation and manufacturing, but in recent times its felt like they have chosen to prioritize shareholders and investors over their own employees. I am hopeful that with this successful negotiation with the Machinists, that Boeing can learn from this experience and get back to where the company came from: a business focused not only on short-term profits but on building the best airplanes in the world. It’s their middle- and working-class employees that build value not only in Boeing but also in our broader economy. I’m glad to see their work being recognized with this agreement that sets a new standard for workers in the aerospace industry.

'1845649817315225988',"I am disappointed by Boeing’s decision to lay off 10 percent of its 170,000-employee workforce over the coming months. This is a hard day for Boeing employees across the world and many of whom reside in King County, Washington. My heart is with those employees and their families who will find themselves out of work.
 
Employees are being forced to absorb the consequences of poor corporate management and oversight. In recent years, the company has prioritized profits and stakeholders over the integrity of their product and the well-being of their employees. This strategy is clearly not working. From production delays, faulty parts, stranded astronauts, ongoing litigation, and investigations, Boeing has struggled to produce high quality products.
 
This failure has a rippling impact on the nation and the strength of American aerospace. Boeing is a giant legacy aerospace company and the way that they do business impacts not only folks in King County, but also people across the world. Our transportation sector and our national defense rely on the strength of Boeing, but any company is only as strong as its workforce.
 
Boeing’s success relies on its dedicated employees, and investing in them is essential for long-term recovery. Boeing employees have put up with a lot for a long time, from cut pensions to insufficient wage increases. Now more than ever, a fair resolution to the machinists’ strike is essential to restore trust and show commitment to those who drive Boeing’s future.

'1844471015146963138',"I released a new statement calling for stability and de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

The continued conflict in Gaza, the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the ongoing proxy war with Iran, the fight with the Houthis, the fight with Iranian proxies in Syria — all of these conflicts are devastating to the civilian population and continue to place significant numbers of civilians at risk across Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere. Each of these conflicts runs the risk of massive escalation.

The international community needs to recognize that Iran remains the main driver of this conflict. They have backed Hezbollah, the Houthis, Hamas, and other Shia militias in Iraq and Syria for years. Israel is threatened by these extremist proxy groups that continually try to exterminate their country, some of whom explicitly have as their motto “death to the U.S., death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews.” This rhetoric and their attempts to destroy Israel through missiles or terrorist attacks is abominable. Israel has a right to defend itself against these existential threats. However, even as we understand Israel’s motivations to fight back against these extremist groups, the risk of escalation and the cost to the civilian population puts Israel and others in the region at even greater risk.

The only way out of this regional conflict is to have a coalition of the U.S., Israel, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E., Jordan, Qatar, and other Arab states as a deterrence to Iran. That will never happen if there isn’t a future for the Palestinian people. While I understand Israel’s response to the threat from Iran and all of their proxies, I am adamantly opposed to Israel’s approach to the West Bank. It is unacceptable for Israel to continue to press claims into the West Bank that have no support in international law. It is also completely unacceptable for Israel to not have a plan for a post-Hamas future for Palestinians in Gaza. Peace will never be achieved unless there is a future for the Palestinian people.

Ceasefire negotiations have never been more important. I support the Biden Administration’s continued efforts to bring parties in the region together to achieve that ceasefire in Gaza, Lebanon, and Israel.",en,Tweet,2,9,7,11,2526,2024-10-10 21:12:13,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZjgbpcXYAA1gIY.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZjgdm4W0AoyycS.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZjgdm4XQAEC6ZY.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZjgdm4WsAk54pz.jpg"

'1843372725592830446',"Today marks the one-year anniversary of the horrific attack on Israel by Hamas. On October 7, 2023, over 1,200 men, women, and children were brutally murdered, including 46 U.S. citizens, and hundreds more were taken hostage. My thoughts are with the victims of this staggering act of terrorist violence, as well as their loved ones and survivors. 
 
As I have said before, I vehemently condemn that attack, and Israel has a right and a duty to ensure Hamas is never able to commit such an atrocity again. Israel also has a right to defend against hostilities from Iran, Hezbollah, and other threats. I support the U.S.’s financial and military commitment to Israel's security. Attacks on Israel from regional actors have significantly increased, threatening civilians across the Middle East and in Israel. We must continue to assist Israel in their defense against these existential threats.
 
The U.S. must also remain committed to working with all partners in the region to try to reduce hostilities and ultimately get to a ceasefire. The war in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of people and, despite countless attempts to rescue them, more than 100 hostages remain in captivity – including four American citizens. Civilians in the Gaza strip are struggling to survive in catastrophic conditions lacking basic necessities like food, water, medical care, and shelter.
