I am proud to have voted in favor of this bill that would spur innovation, acquisition reform, and the restoration of America’s defense industrial base. In order to deter the looming threats posed by adversaries such as China and Russia, the US warfighter needs to have the best tools and resources at their disposal. 

After all, the potential conflicts of tomorrow will be decided by whomever has the best access to accurate, timely information, which means this bill’s investments in AI and drone technology will prove vital. At the same time, the United States’ missile defense status quo is currently unsustainable. Therefore, this bill also serves as a down payment on President Trump’s Golden Dome missile defense system, dovetailing with key investments in hypersonics and the space domain.
