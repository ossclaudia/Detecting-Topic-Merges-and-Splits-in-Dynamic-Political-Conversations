'1900264784110768145',"President Trump’s latest reckless decision to fire thousands of employees at the Department of Education jeopardizes critical student aid programs, weakens protections for students’ civil rights, and undermines essential support for students with disabilities. This move severely threatens every child’s access to a quality education nationwide.

Trump and Musk are prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy over the future of our students.  It’s selfish, and it’s illegal. This radical gutting of the Department will mean funding cuts for every student:

- 26 million kids across every school district—rural, suburban and urban—will lose access to critical funding to help them get succeed. 

- 12 million students will lose access to career and technical education, including pathways to good-paying jobs through apprenticeship programs in trades and STEM careers. 

- 10 million students from low-income families could lose access to higher education.  

- 7.5 million students with Individualized Education Plans—accounting for 15 percent of all students nationwide —will lose access to special education services.",en,Tweet,504,832,248,4562,2587227,2025-03-13 19:16:44,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
