Did you know that prescription drugs are often thrown in the trash, where they can be retrieved, abused, or illegally sold? It's important to note that you should NOT throw away or flush expired or unneeded prescription drugs down the drain.

Official prescription drug collection sites are a great way to safely dispose of your unneeded or leftover prescriptions.

Tomorrow, October 26th, be sure to swing by a participating location to drop off any prescription drugs you no longer need.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a comprehensive list of participating locations across the country, including throughout Northern Ohio.
