'1940778247303626800',"I fully support President Trump’s agenda, 100%. Throughout this process, I have fought to improve the One Big Beautiful Bill in order to deliver as many conservative and fiscally responsible wins for the American people as possible.

As an ardent defender of our Second Amendment liberties, I’ve also fought to use this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore our constitutional freedoms through budget reconciliation. While the current bill removes NFA taxes on suppressors and short-barreled firearms, it falls short of eliminating the registration of the tax because the unelected Senate parliamentarian erroneously deemed the provision violated the Byrd Rule. 

That’s why I offered a commonsense amendment to repeal the NFA registration for suppressors and short-barreled firearms. Unfortunately, my pro-2A amendment was not made in order — meaning it never received a vote in committee or on the House floor. Therefore, I initially made it known that I would vote against the rule (a procedural vote), hoping to have the opportunity to amend it to restore our Second Amendment freedoms.

I also had the opportunity to discuss this critical matter directly with President Trump at the White House. I look forward to working with him and his Administration to further restore our 2A rights. Stay tuned.

When additional 2A changes in the OBBB were not obtainable, I modified my vote on the rule to YES in order to advance historic tax cuts, spending cuts, border security, job creation, and massive deregulation, as well as the removal of the draconian NFA’s foundation by eliminating the unconstitutional taxation on suppressors and short-barreled firearms.

I vowed to fight until the very end — and I meant it. Bottom line, we need more pro-2A champions in Congress, not just anti-gun control Republicans. Rest assured, I will keep fighting through all avenues — pushing legislative solutions here in Congress, advocating for executive actions, and supporting challenges in court — until the 91-year-old infringement of NFA registration is gone for good.

I will also be voting YES on final passage, because I support fulfilling President Trump’s America First agenda and the promises we made to the country. I look forward to President Trump signing the One Big Beautiful Bill into law so we can deliver a safer, stronger, and more prosperous America.",en,Tweet,192,4940,582,1086,477110,2025-07-03 15:22:46,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1939026938687021189',"I certainly understand the frustration surrounding the 2A provisions.

I’ve been fighting for MONTHS to secure the elimination of both NFA taxation AND registration for suppressors, SBRs, SBSs, and AOWs.

I successfully added this measure for suppressors in the House-passed budget reconciliation bill, and I’ve worked with Senate Republicans to not only keep this provision but to also expand it to cover short-barreled firearms.

All of it was written into the Senate’s first version. But the unelected Senate parliamentarian struck it down, erroneously claiming it violated the Byrd Rule.

I vehemently disagree with her.

In fact, many of her rulings prove she’s a partisan hack incapable of making non-partisan decisions. To be clear, I believe the Senate parliamentarian deserves to be FIRED immediately.

But apparently the Senate is not going to fire her or overrule her decision at this time.

Therefore, we have to use the opportunity to rewrite the 2A provision in an attempt to get as much past the Senate parliamentarian as possible.

The latest version eliminates all the NFA taxation on suppressors and short-barreled firearms.

Of course I also want the NFA registration eliminated, as it is inseparably linked to the tax. That’s why I’ve fought tirelessly for months. Yet we can’t pass up an opportunity to end the 91-year-old unconstitutional taxation under the draconian NFA.

This rewrite is another shot at this provision. It’s not perfect, but it’s far better than getting zero 2A victories.

I strongly believe eliminating the tax provides a highly credible basis to challenge the NFA registration in court—because with the taxation repeal, there is no longer a foundation for the registration.  The registration database is the method used by the government to account for the tax paid on each firearm by the serial number of the firearm. That’s why they are inseparably linked. No tax, no foundation for a registration database.

We are not giving up, oh no!! We have just begun to fight and win. Let’s use this rare opportunity to eliminate the tax and restore another part of our Second Amendment rights.",en,Tweet,136,3669,501,925,173287,2025-06-28 19:23:42,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1925509487483392436',"This morning, House Republicans passed President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill with my support.

Over the past few days, I’ve worked tirelessly to improve this legislation, as it’s critical that we include as many America First priorities as possible. Budget reconciliation provides us a rare, filibuster-proof opportunity to deliver on our promises to the American people — including historic tax cuts to hardworking Americans, spending cuts, border security funding, job creation, and massive deregulation.

After productive negotiations with the White House and House GOP Leadership, we moved this legislation in a better direction. 

For example, we moved work requirements for able-bodied adults on Medicaid up to December 2026 (from the previous and unserious start in 2029). We also secured new incentives for non-Medicaid expansion states (such as Georgia) and made progress in ending Green New Scam subsidies.

One of my key priorities throughout this process has been restoring our constitutional 2A rights, which have been subjected to unconstitutional infringements for the last 90 years under the draconian NFA. The original bill text only removed the $200 transfer tax for suppressors. Now, the bill eliminates both the transfer and making tax for suppressors, as well as the registration. This is a massive 2A victory — one that takes important steps toward restoring our constitutional freedoms.

Unfortunately, the bill does not eliminate the taxation and registration of SBRs, SBSs, and AOWs. Yet we CANNOT give up. Next, this legislation will move to the Senate, providing opportunities for additional positive changes. I’ll be working closely with Senate Republicans to add this provision, and I encourage folks to stay engaged on this matter as the budget reconciliation process moves forward.

I’m encouraged that we’ve strengthened and advanced the One Big Beautiful Bill, and I look forward to working toward getting this historic legislation to President Trump’s desk.
