'1965882695134884268',"Political violence is meant to silence the voice and will of the people. Rest assured, anyone who has heard of Charlie Kirk, knows that the movement he inspired will never let the evil actions of a coward stop the advancement of civility, liberty, and patriotism that he helped ignite. 

Charlie was a faithful Christian and a principled patriot who often engaged with people he disagreed with in a productive and passionate way. He supported spirited, but peaceful, debate and played an important role in recruiting young voters to the conservative movement. 

Political violence was the complete opposite of what Charlie professed, yet it has become commonplace in America today. It is inspired by people who hate liberty, who despise freedom, and who will attack anyone who brings decency and time-tested values back to our culture.

As a believer, I am comforted that Charlie is now with His Creator and that he lived a life of purpose in his years spent here on earth. Our hearts and prayers need to be focused on lifting up Charlie’s beautiful family and loved ones that he leaves behind.",en,Tweet,2,36,9,12,2752,2025-09-10 21:58:53,"<a href=""https://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TweetDeck Web App</a>",,,,

'1919758736307974389',"In Oklahoma, we know about energy.

Oklahoma is home to major players in the oil & gas industry - in fact, Tulsa was once the oil capital of the world. But did you know that Oklahoma is also one of the leading states in renewable energy as well?

That's because we understand that we need both. Solar and wind, so-called 'green' energy sources, are great. But we can't rely on them full-time. That's why we're always going to need nuclear power, natural gas, and coal. These traditional energy sources are reliable and provide Americans with accessible, affordable, dependable energy.

The recent power outages across Spain and Portugal prove this point. You don't need to go all-in on any one or the other. An all-of-the-above approach guarantees reliable energy access.

The whole world can learn a lesson from these blackouts: virtue signaling to the climate lobby will come at the expense of your power grid.

'1912511626839793689',"Every major corporation started as a small business in someone’s garage or dorm room. These success stories are because of the opportunity that exists in the United States of America. 

Someone can take a good idea, apply a little elbow grease, and create a business.

In recent decades, the government has encroached further and further into small businesses’ operations, levying unfair taxes and burdensome regulations.

Thankfully, President Donald Trump’s tax cuts helped level the playing field for small businesses.

Without action by Congress, this tax break for small businesses will vanish in 2026.

The relief provided by TCJA has been a lifeline for many, so the prospect of a major tax hike at the beginning of the year would be like pulling a rug out from under them — and not for big businesses on Wall Street, but the small businesses on Main Street.

'1895145282599559315',"With the brutal murder of the precious Bibas family - and the disgusting display of celebration from Hamas and the Palestinian people - the world is finally waking up to the truth.

And yet, the Bibas family are just a small number of the thousands of victims of Hamas' October 7th attack. Many remain in Hamas captivity. Families in Israel and around the world will forever be broken because of Hamas' indiscriminate and barbaric killing. 

There is no defense for Hamas' actions. There is no defense for the behavior of the Palestinian people.
