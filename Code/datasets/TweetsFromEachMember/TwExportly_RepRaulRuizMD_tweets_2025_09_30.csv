Reports of Palestinians—including children—dying from hunger and malnutrition are heartbreaking and unacceptable. This is a man-made crisis, and urgent action is needed. Time is of the essence. Every day that food, water, and life-saving medical care are blocked from reaching civilians, more lives will be lost, especially children.
 
That’s why I sent letters to @POTUS Trump and @SecRubio demanding that they increase humanitarian resources to Gaza, and urge Israel and Hamas to end the war, and release all hostages.

They must guarantee safe and unfettered access for international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations that abide by the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence to provide food, clean water, sanitation, and urgent medical care.

'1936933309222879457',"Donald Trump’s dangerous and unilateral decision to attack Iran — without the required consent of Congress — has needlessly put American lives at risk. While most Americans believe that a nuclear-armed Iran is a threat to world peace, they also agree that American involvement in Mideast conflicts has usually been disastrous.

Trump helped create this crisis by withdrawing the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement. That thoughtless decision made the world a more dangerous place — and he then failed to deliver on the peace “deal” he repeatedly promised. His actions today will have many unforeseen consequences, including the likelihood of endangering U.S. troops and involving our nation in yet another endless war.

I urge level heads to prevail and pray for the safety of our troops.

'1890847625479635418',"🚨 Extreme House Republicans and Speaker Johnson just released their budget—and it’s a disaster for hardworking families. While billionaires get massive tax breaks, everyday Americans will see their costs skyrocket. Here’s what that means for our communities in #CA25 ⬇

🏥 Higher health care costs: Under the Extreme House Republican budget plan, 27,000 people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act would see their average annual premium increase by $2,310—forcing many to choose between paying for rent, groceries, and health care.

For example, a 60-year-old couple with a household income of $85,000 from our
communities would see their health insurance costs increase by $11,632 per year.

💊 Medi-Cal cuts put lives at risk: 289,655 people in our region on Medi-Cal are at risk of losing their health care under Speaker Johnson’s budget. This includes 125,169 children under the age of 19 and 23,630 seniors over 65.

🥕 Food assistance under attack: Speaker Johnson’s budget threatens the 55,925 people who count on SNAP to put food on the table.

And that’s just the start. Extreme House Republicans are going after even more essential programs—all to hand out tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.
