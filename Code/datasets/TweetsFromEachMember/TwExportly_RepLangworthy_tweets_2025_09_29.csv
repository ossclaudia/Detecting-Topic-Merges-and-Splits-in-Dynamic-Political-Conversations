'1965933316059648034',"Charlie Kirk was murdered for daring to speak the truth and defend freedom. He was a husband, a father, a follower of Jesus Christ, and a fearless American patriot.

He fought relentlessly for a stronger America and never bowed to the forces of censorship or intimidation. His pride in our nation and his unwavering stand for free speech will never be forgotten.

The extreme Left chose today not to fight a war of ideas — but to indulge their derangement through cold-blooded murder, seeking to silence his voice forever.

Let me be clear: Charlie’s voice will never be silenced. His cause will only grow stronger, his fight will live on, and the movement he helped inspire will rise higher than ever.

May God bless his beautiful family in this time of immense tragedy and loss.
