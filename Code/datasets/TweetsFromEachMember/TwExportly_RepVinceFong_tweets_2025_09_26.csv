Rep. Vince Fong (CA-20) issued the following statement after the “American Relief Act” was voted on by the House tonight and failed to pass by a vote of 174-235-1. 
 
“I had serious concerns with the first CR introduced with the extraneous and questionable provisions that were jammed inside and which I simply could not support. Clearly, we need more transparency in our government. Because of the inaction by Senator Schumer and the Senate who refused to pass any appropriations bills this year, it has created this last-minute mess, holding needed disaster and agricultural relief hostage so the Democrats could obtain many questionable provisions. The new CR agreement - the American Relief Act - focused on the basics and was the first of many steps to change how Washington works. Unfortunately, Democrats have chosen to ignore the needs of the American people right before Christmas and the holiday season and caused the bill to fail. I am hopeful we will come to an agreement that will allow us to tackle our nation’s most pressing challenges and, along with the Trump-Vance Administration, Make America Great Again.”",en,Tweet,0,7,2,8,710,2024-12-20 00:23:13,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Small businesses are struggling with mounting burdens of taxes, fees and regulations that the Newsom Administration continues to pile on.
