'1940841537211896033',"Today, the Republican-led Congress sent the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to the President’s desk, and with it a blueprint for Alaska’s self-determined future. I am honored to serve and deliver for the state we love:

☑️Unlocking our resources. Mandatory lease sales open 1.6 million acres in ANWR, 20 million acres in the NPR-A, and 6 million acres in Cook Inlet - more than 30 million acres in total, almost the size of the entire state of Florida! Alaska will receive a greater share of federal royalties than ever before, growing the Permanent Fund and keeping PFDs strong for decades.

☑️Putting money back in your pocket. Overtime and tips are now tax-free, small-business depreciation is immediate, and the Trump tax cuts are made permanent so families can save, and businesses can hire. Further, there are even additional deductions for seniors on Social Security.

☑️Securing the border. More than $100 billion in new resources equips Border Patrol agents and delivers advanced technology to help stop fentanyl before it reaches Alaska’s towns and villages.

☑️Investing in safety. The single largest Coast Guard appropriation in U.S. history funds 16 new Arctic-class icebreakers and major port upgrades, while $12.5 billion modernizes Air Traffic Control. This bill protects mariners, pilots, and every community that depends on them.

☑️Protecting care where it is needed. Medicaid integrity reforms guarantee help for the truly vulnerable, and new rural-hospital funding helps keep all Alaskans healthy.

This legislation fulfills our longstanding goal: Alaska charting its own course, creating good-paying jobs today, and providing opportunity for generations to come.

Alaska’s forests are one of our state’s greatest natural assets and the “Roadless Rule” has long stifled responsible forest management, blocked access to critical resources, and halted economic opportunity 
particularly in Alaska, where 92% of the Tongass National Forest was off-limits.

The Roadless Rule was never about responsible conservation; it was about bureaucratic overreach that undermined the ability of local forest managers and communities to effectively manage their lands.

'1930599044360925533',"There is a great deal of confusion around the OBBBA. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scored growth over the next 10 years at 1.8%. At no point in modern history has the United States experienced such low growth as is projected by the CBO.  

Consider this:

- The Atlanta Fed’s most recent GDP estimate for Q2 is 4.6%!
- We are in the middle of an AI revolution.
- We are on the cusp of a robotics revolution.
- We have 8 Trillion dollars of new investment committed to the U.S. over the new several years. To put this into context, the U.S. GDP is approximately 28 Trillion, making this incremental investment commitment so large it actually dwarfs the entire 10 year CBO growth projection on its own.

The bottom line is that the CBO scoring for GDP is clearly flawed, and is being used to mislead the public. The One Big Beautiful Bill is pro-growth, responsible legislation that helps put us on a better track.

'1897152017585557522',"Tonight, President Trump reaffirmed his vision for a stronger America. That vision is one that prioritizes economic strength, national security, and prosperity for hardworking families. In just two short months, we’ve already seen a decisive shift toward restoring the American Dream, and I am committed to working alongside the President to continue delivering real results for Alaskans.  

House Republicans are laser-focused on fulfilling the agenda that the American people overwhelmingly supported in November. That means passing key legislation to cut taxes, make life more affordable, secure our southern border, and bring manufacturing and energy production back to the United States. It’s time to roll back the damage done by the failed Biden-Harris policies, and that work has already begun.  

Alaska is poised to play a central role in America’s energy resurgence. Under President Trump’s leadership, we have an opportunity to unleash our full resource potential—creating jobs, driving down energy costs, and ensuring the United States is no longer dependent on foreign adversaries for the resources we need. That means pushing forward with responsible resource development in the Arctic, opening new opportunities for drilling and mining, and finally getting Alaska’s long-awaited LNG pipeline across the finish line.  

For far too long, Washington bureaucrats and radical environmentalists have stood in the way of Alaska’s ability to fuel not just our state, but the nation. Those days are over. Under the leadership of President Trump, we can produce more, refine more, and lead the world in energy innovation. Alaska’s resources must be at the forefront of America’s energy dominance, and I am committed to ensuring we develop them responsibly while strengthening our economy.  

I was especially encouraged by President Trump’s focus on rebuilding American industry. His leadership has already spurred nearly $2 trillion in private investment commitments, bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores. This resurgence will strengthen our economy, create good-paying jobs, and ensure that America—and Alaska—remain at the forefront of innovation and production.
