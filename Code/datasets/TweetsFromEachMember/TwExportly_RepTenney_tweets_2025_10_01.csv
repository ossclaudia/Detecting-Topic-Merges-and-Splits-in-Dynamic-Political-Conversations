On January 30, 2024 I filed a formal nomination for @realDonaldTrump with the Norwegian Nobel Committee. 

In order to be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize, a formal nomination must be received before the January 31st deadline. I am the ONLY member of Congress that submitted a formal nomination of President Trump.

The Abraham Accords, the first new Arab-Israeli peace agreements in nearly 30 years, were brokered by President Trump, shattering the myth that peace in the Middle East required endless concessions to terrorists. 

While sitting in Court in Manhattan, during a partisan show-trial, President Trump saw the Newsweek clip of my nomination and wrote “Thanks, Claudia!”

On December 11, 2024, with the 2025 nomination window open, I resubmitted the nomination, this time adding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to highlight the coalition that stood up to Iran’s terrorist proxies and radical Palestinian terrorism.  

The next window opens in the Fall. When the nomination portal reopens, I will file a 3rd nomination if President Trump doesn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize, as he deserves.
