Yes. I also oppose polite euphemisms that help politicians dodge responsibility for the deadly conflicts they often engineer and force you to pay for.

A bitter irony: since the Department of Defense was named in 1947, few foreign engagements have actually involved defense of our homeland. And far too few have achieved victory.

The last time Congress actually declared war on an enemy was 1942. 

For a country that hasn’t been “at war” with an enemy for 80 years, we sure have been fighting a lot. 

President Trump’s return to tradition is reason enough to restore this venerable name. From The War of 1812 to WWII, Americans fought bravely under the direction of the Department of War.

But there’s another reason I think we should restore that title. It is a better descriptor of what our Armed Forces do, or, what they are supposed to do: wage war when necessary and defeat our enemies. 

We need to fix how and when politicians choose to send our courageous soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines into harm’s way. 

We need to fix how Congress throws your money at the Pentagon (and the military industrial complex) supposedly to protect our country, and gets woke policies, overpriced and insufficient equipment, and defeat overseas. 

That starts with rectifying names. 

Our military should be powerful and capable. It should wage and win wars. Congress should have to vote on those wars. 

And they should be overseen by the United States Department of War.",en,Tweet,24,686,206,106,25642,2025-09-03 00:10:32,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gz4JTYbbAAQWb-G.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gz4JTYbaIAAJ-pY.jpg"

Piloting his B-17 above Nazi-occupied France, two minutes away from a bomb drop to destroy a German arsenal of V-1 rockets, his aircraft sustained heavy damage and Lt. Wilson was critically injured. 

Finding that one of his crew members had lost his parachute, Lt. Wilson gave him his own, and told him to jump.

After keeping the aircraft steady long enough to ensure that all 8 members of his crew could bail out, he skillfully steered the plane, still full of bombs, away from a small French village.

No one knew where Lt. Wilson was until July 8th, 2018, when his remains were found.

Supporting the designation of June as Fidelity Month for the purpose of rededicating the United States to the values of faith, family, and patriotism.

Whereas a recent opinion poll of Americans showed support for traditional values has significantly declined;

Whereas a majority of Americans no longer view values like faith, family, patriotism, or being involved in the community as very important;

Whereas these values used to unite Americans;

Whereas the decline in these values has corresponded with a rise in crime, drug abuse, alienation, and family disintegration;

Whereas fidelity means dedication to faith, spouses and families, and country and communities;

Whereas citizens of all faiths can join in recommitting the United States to fidelity;

Whereas John Adams, a founding father of the United States, said, ‘‘Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.’’;

Whereas survival of the United States depends on the shared bonds of faith, family, and patriotism; and

Whereas it is fitting to observe one month each year to rededicate the United States to its core values: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that June should be designated as Fidelity Month for the purpose of rededicating the United States to the values of faith, family, and patriotism.

'1932084073175867541',"Are you tired of paying too much for medications?

I just introduced a bill to make your prescription drugs more affordable: The Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act.

“Biosimilars” – generic alternatives to name-brand medications – have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of biologic drugs through increased competition.

Choosing biosimilars over their name-brand counterparts could save consumers an estimated $42.9 billion by 2027.

Americans deserve to hold this decision-making power, but red tape around biosimilars keeps them from being widely used. The FDA’s complex approval system has confused physicians, patients, and states about biosimilars’ safety and efficacy.

Biosimilars must undergo extensive testing to prove they provide no meaningful difference from their name-brand version. Bringing a new biosimilar to market costs as much as $300 million and can take as long as 9 years.

Even after this approval, patients may not be able to access biosimilars because Congress created a separate designation: interchangeability. To be classified as truly “interchangeable” with the name-brand version, a biosimilar must undergo further testing called “switching studies.” This type of research has proven unnecessary for biosimilars, as it repeatedly shows no meaningful difference or relevant new data.

The Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act would remove these extra steps so that a biosimilar will immediately be classified as interchangeable upon its initial approval by the FDA. Foregoing unnecessary switching studies would no longer disqualify biosimilars as alternatives to their name-brand counterparts.

We need to give Americans the option to save billions on their medications and increase competition in the pharmaceutical market.

We should pass the Biosiliar Red Tape Elimination Act.

'1924920506425254123',"Why are Democrats so vehemently opposed to the SAVE Act?

Why require proof of citizenship to get a job and not require the same verification to vote?

In Utah, California, and 17 other states, illegal immigrants can receive a drivers license.

What is to stop these illegal immigrants from checking the box saying they are a citizen and registering to vote? Nothing. Indeed, the Supreme Court found--wrongly, in my view--that states are forbidden from requiring proof of citizenship during registration.

This needs to change. 

Elections sometimes come down to “exceedingly, exceedingly, exceedingly” small margins.

These are illegal population numbers from Pew Research, as of 2022–and remember, they further exploded during Joe Biden’s presidency!
 
Pew estimated 1.4% of Wisconsin’s population is here illegally. The presidential race there was decided by a 0.8% margin.

In Nevada, 5.8% of the state’s population is here illegally. The last presidential race was decided by a 3.1% margin.

In Georgia, the estimate is 3.4% are here illegally. The last Presidential election was decided by a 2.2% margin.

In Pennsylvania the estimate is 1.8% here illegally. The last presidential election was decided by a 1.7% margin.

In North Carolina the estimate is 3% here illegally. The last presidential race was decided by a 3.2% margin.

In Michigan the estimate is 1.3% here illegally. The last presidential race was decided by a 1.4% margin.

Even if a small number of foreign nationals illegally vote in American elections, they nullify the votes of American citizens damage the entire process.

'1916936472479076817',"ABORTION PILL FLASHBACK: SENATE FLOOR 2020

First, the mother is given a pill that blocks progesterone – a hormone necessary for pregnancy – and breaks down the lining of her uterus. Without progesterone, the baby, whose heart is already beating, is starved to death and dies in her mother’s womb.

Then, 24 to 48 hours later, the mother is given a second pill that empties her uterus by causing severe contractions and bleeding, mimicking an early miscarriage that can last anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks.

Planned Parenthood will try to gloss over the truth, claiming that a hot shower and some ibuprofen are enough for a quick recovery to get the mother back on her feet.

But on average, the miscarriage lasts between 9 to 16 days and can last for as long as 30 days.

Most of the time these abortions are done at home; so the mother is left to suffer alone, without care or supervision from a doctor, and often without any follow-up until 7 to 14 days later – if ever.

The result? Women have suffered tragic, gruesome, and horrific experiences from using the abortion pill.

It has caused nearly 4,200 adverse medical events – including more than 1,000 hospitalizations, and nearly 600 instances of blood loss requiring transfusions.

Some women have even died. The FDA has reported 24 maternal deaths from the abortion pill since its approval in 2000. And those are just the officially reported ones that we know of that have happened even with the regulations we currently have in place.

Some women need corrective surgery after taking the abortion pill, and others need life-saving procedures.

And somehow, we call this “healthcare.”",en,Tweet,12,235,80,20,18203,2025-04-28 20:24:04,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1916935099813068800/vid/avc1/1280x720/KR8UYDdAO1athRl6.mp4?tag=16

'1912167208748265719',"Google and Facebook have a stranglehold on the digital advertising landscape.

That's why I have introduced the bipartisan AMERICA Act to break their monopoly.

Here's the deal...

When you visit a website or open an app, a real-time auction serves an ad on the website or app. The auction takes place in a fraction of second, in much the same way that electronic securities trading functions.

Billions of times every day, publishers use supply-side brokers and advertisers use demand-side brokers to connect with one another in the ad exchanges, which is a real-time auction marketplace.

As Google’s own employees have said “[t]he analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the New York Stock Exchange.”

Digital advertising is dominated by Google and Facebook. Google, in particular, is the leading or dominant player in every part of the ad tech stack: buy-side, sell-side, and the exchange that connects them.

For example, Google Ad Manager is used by 90% of large publishers, and in the third quarter of 2018 it served 75% of all online display ad impressions.

Google uses its pervasive market power across the digital advertising ecosystem, and exploits numerous conflicts of interest, to extract monopoly rents and stack the deck in its favor. These monopoly rents function as a tax—upwards of 40%—on every ad-supported website and every business that advertises online, collectively a huge segment of the modern
economy.

Examples of alleged conduct by Google include:

·  Giving its own ad services information and speed advantages over competitors
·  Steering bids to its own services to the detriment of its customers and competitors
·  Using information about its competitors’ trading activity to give its own properties an advantage
·  Coercing publishers to license Google’s ad server
·  Using its control over publisher ad serving to block competition from other ad exchanges
·  Manipulating auctions to exclude competition from competing ad services
·  Hiding anticompetitive behavior behind opaque and non-transparent practices
·  Using its control over the ad stack to punish publishers and competitors that try to develop new
competitive alternatives to circumvent Google’s abuse

Google is not the only company that operates on both sides of the ad tech market, however. Rules to address its stranglehold should be written broadly, to avoid replacing one abusive monopolist with another.

The Advertising Middlemen Endangering Rigorous Internet Competition Accountability (AMERICA) Act restores and protects competition in digital advertising in two ways:

1. The AMERICA Act prohibits large digital advertising companies from owning more than one part of the digital ad ecosystem if they process more than $20 billion in digital ad transactions:

a) Ad exchange owners cannot own supply-side platform or demand-side platform.

b) Supply-side platform owners cannot also own a demand-side platform, and vice versa.

c) Buyers and sellers of digital advertising cannot own a demand-side platform or supply-side platform (except to sell their own advertising inventory).

2. The AMERICA Act requires medium-sized and larger digital advertising companies that process more than $5 billion in digital ad transactions to abide by several obligations to protect their customers and competition. The key obligations include the following:

a) They must act in the best interests of their customers, including by making the best execution for bids on ads.

b) They must provide transparency to their customers so that those customers can verify they are acting in their best interest.

c) If allowed to operate on both sides of the market, the company must erect firewalls to prevent abuse and conflicts of interest.

d) They must provide fair access to all customers with respect to performance and information related to transactions, exchange processes, and functionality.

These restrictions and requirements mirror those imposed on electronic trading in the financial sector— an industry to which Google itself has compared its technology.

The AMERICA Act would be enforced by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general. It also includes a private right of action for violations of the best interest, transparency, and other requirements imposed at the $5 billion threshold when committed by companies over the $20 billion threshold.

If it becomes law, the bill would most likely require Google and Facebook to divest significant portions of their advertising businesses—business units that account for or facilitate a large portion of their ad revenue. Amazon may also have to make divestments, and the bill will impact Apple’s accelerating entry into third-party ads.

Several smaller ad tech competitors would also fall under the best interest and transparency requirements, but industry experts have confirmed that any compliance burden would not impair their ability to compete.

If you made it this far, thank you and congratulations!

'1908210526100087260',"This week I introduced the Stopping Harmful Incidents to Enforce Lawful Drone Use (SHIELD-U) Act and the Drone Integration and Zoning Act.
 
These bills equip state and local law enforcement with the authority needed to protect their citizens, communities, and airports from drone threats.

The current regulatory environment stifles state and local governments’ ability to mitigate drone threats. The FAA currently regulates “navigable airspace” which is defined as “above the minimum altitudes of flight” which is typically 500 ft. However, the FAA has taken some liberties in recent years and stated that minimum altitude of flight for drones is above a blade of grass. 

Right now, Congress has exclusively granted limited authority to detect and takedown a drone only to the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Department of Energy. 

According to a Blue Ribbon Task Force Report commissioned by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) and Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA), one challenge in meeting current drone threats is the federal government’s lack of human resources or capital to invest in and operate counter drone technology at airports. 

When considered beyond an airport environment, the challenge becomes even greater, because federal law does not permit state or local law enforcement to take action. 

The SHIELD-U and Drone Integration and Zoning Acts provide essential tools for state and local law enforcement to address the danger of drones used against Americans that federal regulations have failed to adequately manage. 

By empowering local authorities, these bills ensure that communities and airports have the resources needed to safeguard their citizens and infrastructure from potential harm. 

With the increasing prevalence of drone-related incidents, it is vital to enable local enforcement to act swiftly and effectively in protecting public safety.",en,Tweet,1,111,22,23,9231,2025-04-04 18:30:16,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

The @HUDgov Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule (AFFH) was supposed to manufacture “equitable” socioeconomic outcomes from local zoning decisions that would not otherwise occur in a free market.

The federal government was going to meddle in thousands of communities across America if they didn’t match the government’s race-based ideals.

@realDonaldTrump got rid of this terrible policy in his first term. Biden brought it back. Thankfully, President Trump and HUD @SecretaryTurner have terminated the AFFH rule once more.

But we need legislation to STOP the federal government from running race-based social experiments on our communities ever again.

That’s why I have introduced the Local Zoning Decisions Protection Act, which BANS federal funds from being used to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing.

It is not the federal government’s business to rearrange Americans like chess pieces based on woke insanity. Those days are done.

It’s time to pull the REINS on regulatory overreach. 

Today, I joined @SenRandPaul to introduce the Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act for the 119th Congress. 

This legislation would require that federal regulations with an economic impact of $100 million or more be subject to an up-or-down vote in Congress, reclaiming legislative power from the regulatory state.

Without the REINS Act, Americans will continue to live under the tyranny of unelected bureaucrats who effectively make laws but never have to stand for election. 

But with REINS, Congress has an opportunity to restore its constitutional lawmaking role while saving countless American workers, consumers, businesses, and families from the costs imposed by endless federal regulations.

We cannot allow future administrations to undo the great achievements and reforms of the federal government that President Trump is making today.

'1886808480712917228',"RESOLUTION  

Expressing the vital importance of the Panama Canal to the United States.

Whereas early efforts of the Colombian government and French investors to construct a canal across Panama were unsuccessful and resulted in bankruptcy by 1889;  

Whereas, as a condition of United States Government support for Panama’s independence from Colombia, including the positioning of United States troops in the then-territory of Panama, the United States was to be assured access to construct and control a canal in perpetuity, an agreement that culminated in the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, signed at Washington November 18, 1903;  

Whereas the Panama Canal was never initiated, engineered, or built by the Panamanian government;

Whereas the United States Government funded, pioneered, and built the Panama Canal over a 10-year period from 1904 to 1914, at a cost of $375,000,000 and 10,000 lives, and raised the canal above sea level through construction of a lock system;  

Whereas, historically, the Panama Canal has been distinct from the sovereign territory of Panama;

Whereas the Panama Canal serves as a vital connection between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, connecting the east and west coasts of the United States and providing passage for more than 14,000 vessels in 2023;  

Whereas approximately 72 percent of vessels traveling through the Panama Canal are traveling to or from United States ports;  

Whereas, without the Panama Canal, vessels would have to pass through the notoriously dangerous Cape Horn, extending transit by nearly 8,000 miles;  

Whereas, in 1977, President Carter surrendered United States control over the Panama Canal in a series of trea- ties with Panama known as the ‘‘Torrijos-Carter Trea- ties’’;  

Whereas one of those treaties, the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, signed at Washington September 7, 1977, otherwise known as the ‘‘Neutrality Treaty’’, reserved the right of the United States to use armed force to defend the permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal;  

Whereas, for nearly a decade, the People’s Republic of China has steadily increased its footprint in the Panama Canal;  

Whereas, in 2016, Panama ceded control of Margarita Island, the Panama Canal’s largest Atlantic port, to the People’s Republic of China-affiliated Landbridge Group in a $900,000,000 agreement;  

Whereas, in 2018, Panama entered into a $1,400,000,000 agreement for the China Communications Construction Company and the China Harbor Engineering Company to construct the fourth bridge across the Panama Canal;  

Whereas CK Hutchison Holdings, based in Hong Kong, manages two of the Panama Canal’s five ports, including the Balboa port along the Pacific and Cristobal port along the Atlantic;  

Whereas the rapid acceleration of Chinese influence in the Panama Canal poses a high risk of intelligence-gathering and surveillance by the People’s Republic of China;  

Whereas Chinese law requires the assets of civilian firms to be made available to support the armed forces of the People’s Republic of China;  

Whereas the Panama Canal would serve as a logistics point between the east and west coasts of the United States in the event of a conflict involving United States Armed Forces, cementing its value to homeland and hemispheric defense;  

Whereas the ability of the People’s Republic of China to control major entry and exit points of the Panama Canal would provide the People’s Republic of China with a significant military advantage relevant to United States Armed Forces in the event of a conflict:  

Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate—  

(1) recognizes the ingenuity and labor of Americans that made the Panama Canal possible for future generations, with special regard for those Americans who lost their lives in pursuit of the Panama Canal project;  

(2) expresses that the Panama Canal is vital to United States regional security, hemispheric hegemony, and economic interests;  

(3) assesses that a pattern of Chinese-backed investment in port infrastructure and canal operations in Panama constitutes a violation of the Neutrality Treaty; and  

(4) urges the Trump administration to ensure that the canal remains neutral and to take all appropriate measures to enforce the Neutrality Treaty.

Unfortunately, it still contained $111 billion in deficit spending, with no corresponding cuts. I could not vote for it in good conscience. 

The American people just returned Donald Trump to the White House and gave the GOP control of both the House and Senate in large part because they were hurting from runaway inflation caused by Joe Biden’s reckless federal spending. They are counting on us to stop it. 

We should not turn around and continue Biden’s mistakes. 
 
Our national debt will soon exceed the size of our economy. We have annual budget deficits totaling nearly $2 trillion and this year the federal government will spend more on interest payments to service our debt than we have spent on our own national defense.

As my friend Elon Musk recently said, “what the federal government does not receive in direct revenue they make up for in inflation. They just print money. So, all federal spending is taxation.”

Americans shouldn’t be losing their money to more federal spending or the invisible tax of inflation.

Too many companies profit from adult content reaching children, and it’s going to stop. 

First, this bill creates a private right of action for parents and guardians against app stores that expose their children to pornographic content and extreme violence.

'1843308361166565774',"One year ago, Hamas attacked the people of Israel, murdering nearly 1200, most of whom were civilians, including women and children.

Over 100 hostages taken by Hamas remain missing, including 4 Americans. 

Many within the terrorist leadership of Hamas and their Hezbollah allies have since been killed and scattered, but the poisonous hatred which drove the October 7th attacks still infects our world—from the Middle East, our own college campuses in America.

Yes and no.

Laughing at Joe Biden’s inability to govern was the only way to get the media to take notice of the serious danger his absentee presidency poses to our country.

But Biden’s incapacity has worried most Americans for the last 4 years. He is still president, at least in name, for 3 and a half more months.

'1840834267066110455',"Did you know that the federal government is spying on Americans’ purchases, credit cards, and bank accounts, even if they are innocent of any crime?

Did you know that the @USTreasury and the @FBI have surveilled financial transactions containing the terms “Trump” and MAGA,” and relating to guns and religion?

Did you know that the @SECGov has been quietly constructing a centralized database, called the Consolidated Audit Trail, designed to track every stock market transaction and the personal information of millions of Americans?

These actions are deeply unconstitutional, a violation of your 4th Amendment rights, and enable political persecution.

That’s why I just introduced the Saving Privacy Act:

▪️ Repeals the Bank Secrecy Act’s SAR and CTR reporting requirements while maintaining record-keeping provisions.

▪️Repeals the Corporate Transparency Act.

▪️Strengthens Fourth Amendment protections, bolstering warrant requirements in the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978.

▪️Repeals the SEC’s Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) database.

▪️Requires congressional approval for any new databases that collect personally identifiable information of U.S. citizens.

▪️Prohibits the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency.

▪️Requires congressional authorization for financial regulations deemed major rules.

▪️Institutes penalties for federal employees who illegally seek constitutionally protected financial information.

▪️Establishes a private right of action for Americans and financial institutions harmed by illicit government activity.

Please like and share if you think more Americans should know about this grave threat to our freedom.
