'1966136282645455313',"Yesterday was a very rough day for a lot of the country, and me personally. Charlie Kirk had become a friend and mentor in ways.

Charlie was truly one of the smartest men I’ve ever met. He was also one of the most courageous. He was not afraid to continually share his faith and beliefs. He was not afraid to debate anyone at any time, and for those keeping score, he usually won.

One of my favorite things about Charlie is that he made his mission in life to go deep behind enemy lines in academia, where conservative thoughts and principles are considered “hate speech,” and present an alternative worldview to the next generation.

If I’m being honest, I think myself and many others abandoned academia a long time ago as a completely lost cause. Not only did Charlie have courage, but he had vision. He could see and do things that many of us cannot.

I am disgusted and hurt by the murder of my friend. I’m also saddened that my children and yours must grow up in this world with so much wickedness and evil.

This is just one more very deep and painful reminder to us that life is short and precious. We must make our time here count and keep our priorities straight.

John 14:6 “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” I know where Charlie is today. He’s definitely in a much better place, but if I know anything about my friend, he wasn’t done fighting down here.
