'1923506317446012929',"#FactCheckFriday During the Ways & Means Committee markup this week, Congressional Republicans claimed their tax bill is lowering taxes on low- and middle-income Americans.

Fact: The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed the Republicans’ tax bill and found that under their legislation, people making over $1 million per year will receive a 310-times larger tax break than those making less than $50,000. On average, low-income Americans will receive just $0.72 per day in tax breaks.

We can and should cut taxes for those who need the help without handing massive tax breaks to those who don’t.

FACT: The Social Security Administration has reported that less than .01 percent of Social Security payments are lost to fraud. Seniors, people with disabilities, and rural Americans who can’t access an SSA office in person rely on phone services to set up and manage their benefits. Restricting those services will only prevent millions of Americans from receiving the benefits they earned and deserve.

'1895609939239817718',"#FactCheckFriday Republican leaders are saying their budget doesn’t cut Medicaid because the word “Medicaid” isn’t even in the bill.

FACT: The Republican party's own members are raising alarms about cutting Medicaid. The Republicans’ budget bill instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid, to cut spending by $880 billion. Politico reports: “a group of vulnerable House Republicans is arguing that the bulk of those reductions will have to come out of Medicaid given that the panel has virtually no other options to make cuts of that magnitude.”

Republicans’ claiming that they aren’t cutting Medicaid is as if your neighbor said, “Well I didn’t burn your house down! All I did was hand the arsonist a can of gasoline and a book of matches!”
