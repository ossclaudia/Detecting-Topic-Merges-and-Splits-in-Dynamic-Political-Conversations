'1941119807719661935',"Almost 250 years ago today, our Founders began the great American experiment – establishing a self-governing, democratic nation where all people would have three unalienable rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness 📷 Yet, under this Administration, these fundamental values are being called into question. With ever-more power consolidated in the Executive and an abdication of Congress’s Article I rights and responsibilities by House Republicans, this Administration strays further and further from our Founders’ vision.

'1910123699333636254',"The Judicial Branch is an important check and balance – regardless of who is in the White House or which political party controls Congress. But today, House Republicans passed H.R. 1526, which weakens and limits the judiciary by prohibiting federal district court judges from granting nationwide injunctions that apply to anyone other than the parties to the case. In other words, had this been law in 1954, the groundbreaking Brown vs. Board of Education would only have struck down school segregation for the one student in Topeka, Kansas. 

This type of inconsistency in law across this nation would be chaos. It’s clear that Congressional Republicans are falling into line and attacking the federal judiciary because the President is upset that the courts are exercising judicial review over his unconstitutional agenda.",en,Tweet,0,8,5,3,823,2025-04-10 01:12:32,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Here’s a simple example: Our sailors represent America in countries all around the world with cultures and practices different from our own. That means diverse and multi-lingual troops can often be the difference between a successful mission and a failure.

That’s why I believe that a Navy and Marine Corps that reflect the diversity of our country is our strongest Navy and Marine Corps. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I will continue to fight for a military that respects and appreciates the sacrifices and experiences of all servicemembers. It is shameful that our President and Secretary of Defense cannot do the same.

'1902829486997115132',"For nearly 50 years, the Department of Education has supported America’s children and expanded pathways to higher education and the middle class for millions of students. For Pell Grant recipients, students with disabilities, children in low-income communities, and student loan borrowers, including myself, President Trump’s Executive Order to dismantle the Department of Education is heartbreaking. In Maryland alone, the Department of Education supports over 969,000 kids across 1,400 K-12 schools.

The President is once again overextending the power of the Executive Branch by in effect shutting down the Department of Education—a power that the Framers only granted to Congress. As a proud graduate of public schools, I will always fight for a strong, fully-funded educational system that gives students every opportunity to get ahead. I’ve co-sponsored the Department of Education Protection Act, and I urge my Republican colleagues to join us in reinforcing the power of the legislative branch.

'1897446656154747033',"I was asked by a reporter if there was anything I could agree with the President on during last night’s speech. There were moments—few and far between—that I could find a glimmer of common ground: supporting our servicemembers and first responders, leading the world in innovation and resurrecting shipbuilding in the United States, and ending childhood cancer. 
 
But we can’t end childhood cancer while slashing cancer research funding at the NIH and gutting Medicaid—the number one health insurer of children in this nation. We can’t lead the world in innovation or build more ships while instituting unreasonable tariffs on aluminum and lumber from our trading partners, threatening universities, and turning our back on our democratic allies. We can’t support our servicemembers and first responders by demonizing individuals who want to serve in our military, slashing federal funding for public safety programs, and summarily firing civil servants. 
 
During the longest address by an Executive to the Congress in history, the President spent less than two minutes on the high cost of living that so many Americans are burdened by every day. He did not commit to protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. In fact, he spent 13 minutes in ludicrous rants about fantastical (and wildly false) waste in Social Security and elsewhere in the federal government. 
 
I want to be clear that nothing about this Presidency–including his attacks on the civil service and the Constitution–is normal. I attended the Joint Address because I feel it is an important symbol of Congress as a co-equal branch of government, especially when the Executive is trying to test the limits of its powers. One-third of the American people voted for President Trump, one-third voted for someone else, and one-third did not feel passionately enough, heard, or represented to even vote. I’ll be focused on listening and winning the hearts and minds of folks and colleagues in all three groups. That’s the path forward for us as a nation. That's the only way to earn the trust of colleagues across the aisle who can help us stop a lot of this calamity and nonsense.
