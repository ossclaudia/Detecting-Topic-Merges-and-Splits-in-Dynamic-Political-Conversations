'1970187418859925554',"Collective bargaining rights and workplace protections have lifted up federal employees across the United States for decades, protecting them from unsafe working conditions and political retribution. Whether our neighbors are working to ensure food safety, respond to forest fires, track hurricanes, or review patents, our nation’s federal employees deserve these protections. I’m proud to stand up for our federal employees, as they work tirelessly for our nation’s benefit.

'1969466531596661024',"Yesterday, I voted against two partisan proposals to temporarily fund the government that had no chance of clearing the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. With these votes, we demonstrated what we can’t do - now it’s time to focus on what we can do to avert a shutdown.

As we move forward with negotiations over the next ten days, I am offering a framework that builds upon the three appropriations bills the Senate has already passed on a bipartisan basis while also addressing some timely challenges that Americans are facing today.

I propose extending the ACA’s enhanced premium tax credits to stabilize costs for those on the exchanges, restoring wind down funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and addressing the administration’s illegal pocket rescissions.

I believe this framework can be a starting point for more serious negotiations, and I will be working with my colleagues to build consensus for it. The clock is ticking, the country is watching, and there is a reasonable path available to us to prevent an unnecessary and harmful shutdown.

'1968713610269704292',"In Alaska, our universities utilize Title III funding across many of their rural campuses to support students to success, develop career and technical education programs, and provide occupational endorsement certification for young Alaskans, aiming to address workforce shortages in the state. These institutions are statutorily authorized to receive federal support from the Department to strengthen their capacity to serve Native students, and rely on this federal support to adequately serve all enrolled students. 

I am working with my colleagues to reinforce to the administration that these are statutory grant programs authorized and appropriated by Congress that align with the President’s goal of providing career technical education to the next generation for high-impact workforce needs such as fisheries, healthcare, skilled trades, and energy. As Alaska partners with this administration on several large-scale and exciting projects that can help transform our state, we need a local workforce trained to meet this moment. Cancelling these funds takes us further away from that objective.

Now, it is essential we remember that what unites us is stronger than what divides us. I urge us all to be the light in our communities — to lead with courage, kindness, and understanding. Fulfilling the promise of America depends on choosing dialogue over destruction, and compassion over hatred.

'1961857252354080867',"The firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez just a month after her confirmation, along with the departure of other high-level disease experts the day after her termination, raises considerable questions about what is happening within the agency. Americans must be able to fully trust that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rigorously adheres to science-based and data-driven principles when issuing policy directives. The removal of the director after such a short tenure appears to be evidence that politics are taking precedence over policy.

'1955741845146808521',"This morning, the Mendenhall River crested at a record 16.65 feet. The good news is that water levels are now receding. While there are reports of damage, temporary barriers and other flood mitigation measures are helping reduce the impact on the community, and there are no reports of any loss of life.

Officials are advising folks to avoid flooded streets, especially View Drive. Be sure to check for updates from local officials before returning home or heading into affected areas. Although the waters have started to recede, there are still risks posed to the public.

Late last week, I had the opportunity to visit with the @NWSJuneau office and @KTOOpubmedia as everyone was working around the clock ahead of the outburst, and I know their work has only intensified over the last 72 hours.

That’s the real world. But here in the U.S. Senate, we are currently debating a rescissions package that would severely cut funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, drastically affecting Alaska’s 27 public media stations and many more across the nation.

My goal throughout the reconciliation process has been to make a bad bill better for Alaska, and in many ways, we have done that. In addition to extending pro-growth tax cuts, a larger child tax credit, and no tax on tips or overtime, we made a historic investment and modernization of the Coast Guard; enhanced our border security and national defense; funded aviation safety, including AWOS/VWOS systems that will save lives; and provided tax-exempt status for the Community Development Quota Program to help western Alaska communities establish a sustainable economy, among other provisions.
 
We have advanced new opportunities for resource development in the NPR-A, the Coastal Plain, and Cook Inlet that will help us create jobs and increase the share of revenues our state receives.

Those provisions will benefit our economy, but it is the people of Alaska that I worry about the most, especially when it comes to the potential loss of social safety net programs—Medicaid coverage and SNAP benefits—that our most vulnerable populations rely on. 
 
To address the bill’s shortcomings, we have helped our communities through a $50 billion rural health fund. This will mean hundreds of millions of dollars for Alaska hospitals, community health centers, and other providers. We secured commitments from the CMS Administrator to continue to address longstanding priorities which will directly help Bartlett, Fairbanks Memorial, Central Peninsula, and other hospitals in Alaska.
 
In the SNAP program, we have added tribal exemptions for work requirements, delayed cost-share penalties to help Alaska get benefits to the people who need them, and included work requirement waivers that align with our Medicaid policies. We also secured commitments from the Secretary of Agriculture to provide additional flexibilities to Alaska for SNAP.
 
But, let’s not kid ourselves. This has been an awful process—a frantic rush to meet an artificial deadline that has tested every limit of this institution. While we have worked to improve the present bill for Alaska, it is not good enough for the rest of our nation—and we all know it.
 
My sincere hope is that this is not the final product. This bill needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the President’s desk. We need to work together to get this right.",en,Tweet,727,1343,291,22603,7387303,2025-07-01 20:04:28,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,
'1938981195364069640',"Over the last 30 years, the Universal Service Fund has been instrumental in connecting rural Alaska by supporting telephone services and internet access in schools and low-income households in some of the most unserved and underserved communities in our state. I am pleased to see that the Supreme Court upheld the program, agreeing that Congress has set clear guardrails for the Federal Communications Commission to serve rural Americans. Alaskans can be confident that this program, which helps provide affordable phone and internet services to rural communities, will continue going forward.

'1938743943673659419',"Yesterday, Congress received a detailed briefing on last weekend’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Joint Chiefs Chairman General Dan Caine. They made it clear that these actions were a limited, time-sensitive response to what was judged, based on intelligence, to be an imminent threat to regional stability and U.S. personnel, as required under the War Powers Resolution of 1973.
 
We received confirmation that these strikes were solely focused on disabling Iran’s nuclear capabilities. While damage estimates are still forthcoming, it is believed that the strikes were largely successful in that effort. The use of force was narrowly targeted in scope and duration.

I am satisfied that the President’s actions were justified and within his scope of authority under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which is why I voted against the War Powers Resolution. I hope this vote sends a clear message that the world will not allow Iran to become a nuclear-armed nation and provides the President with the necessary flexibility to negotiate a long and lasting peace in the region.
 
If a larger offensive military operation is ever deemed necessary in the future, only Congress holds authority under the U.S. Constitution to declare war. I’m hopeful that the fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel, negotiated by President Trump, will hold and keep America and our allies safe.
 
I want to again commend the professionalism and skill of the U.S. military in executing these strikes.

'1936945781753209218',"Over the last 24 hours, the administration laid out its rationale for striking Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. President Trump described these as precision strikes on three key nuclear facilities, stressing that Iran must now choose peace. I am encouraged by the administration's assurance that these strikes were deliberately limited in scope, and I hope the Pentagon can soon confirm that Iran’s nuclear capabilities have been neutralized.

While it is unclear how Iran will respond, I urge the regime to resist escalation and to come to the table to negotiate a peaceful resolution. The world was never going to allow them to possess nuclear weapons, and no one should want or allow this to spiral into a protracted fight that results in lives lost and further destabilization of the region.

My colleagues and I will receive a classified briefing later this week to assess the scope of the operation, the administration’s strategy, and the legal justification. I remain hopeful these limited strikes greatly advanced our national security objectives, but if it is clear this is becoming a wider conflict, we must remember that Congress alone holds the constitutional power to authorize war.

I support the extension of President Trump’s tax cuts and look forward to a reconciliation measure that will boost Alaska’s resource production. There are serious shortcomings within this resolution that gave me considerable pause, but overall, I recognize this is the start of a process, not the end. 
 
The resolution’s shortcomings include the adoption of a current policy baseline, a requirement for the Senate to increase the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, the setting of a path that will result in more than $50 trillion in federal debt within a decade, and a reconciliation instruction to a House committee that would require significant cuts to Medicaid. I supported an amendment to strike that instruction during our late-night vote series, but unfortunately, it fell short.

'1905027930985513379',"As we wrote the Coastal Plain program in 2017, we adopted a legal framework substantially similar to the one in place for the NPR-A. After the first Trump administration developed a good program and AIDEA secured seven leases, the Biden administration spent four years attempting to turn the program on its head. From their initial pause and then the cancelation of these leases, to the arbitrary closure of 74 percent of the program area and a lease sale that was designed to fail, I can’t think of a single lawful thing the last administration did on the Coastal Plain. While we lost years of development to their willful intransigence, this decision is an important step to getting things back on track.

'1903256558567559642',"Our lack of mineral security is our nation’s Achilles’ heel—a vulnerability that leaves us at the mercy of politically unstable and often adversarial nations for the basic building blocks of modern society. We import a wide array of minerals from those nations instead of producing minerals here at home, and we do it despite the potentially catastrophic threats that creates for our security, economy, and competitiveness. China knows this. Russia knows this. But, importantly, so do President Trump and his team. I appreciate their recognition of this major vulnerability and their immediate steps to tackle it. This new order is the most robust effort we have seen in some time—with more agencies directed to make greater use of their authorities to strengthen our domestic mineral security for the long-term.

The FBI’s mission is “to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States.” Mr. Patel and I agree the bureau has crept past that mission, become an increasingly political agency, and eroded the public’s trust. We have had multiple frank and open discussions about how best to restore that trust. I agree with Mr. Patel that it begins by getting agents out in the field, doing what they signed up to do, rather than sitting behind an administrative desk.

My reservations with Mr. Patel stem from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership. The FBI must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores. I have been disappointed that when he had the opportunity to push back on the administration’s decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.

While there is no dispute that the U.S. spends more per capita on healthcare than any other country, our health outcomes do not reflect this investment. Instead of focusing on who covers our exorbitant healthcare costs, we need to reduce these costs by directing our attention to prevention and keeping people healthy. This is the appeal of RFK, and many Alaskans have shared that view with me. Chronic conditions are a significant source of illness and major drivers of public debt; he recognizes this and is committed to addressing it.

Vaccines have saved millions of lives, and I sought assurance that, as HHS Secretary, he would do nothing to make it difficult for people to take vaccines or discourage vaccination efforts. He has made numerous commitments to me and my colleagues, promising to work with Congress to ensure public access to information and to base vaccine recommendations on data-driven, evidence-based, and medically sound research. These commitments are important to me and, on balance, provide assurance for my vote.

'1882496900223377719',"Since Mr. Hegseth’s nomination last November, I have met with him and carefully reviewed his writings, various reports, and other pertinent materials. I closely followed his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee and gathered substantial feedback from organizations, veterans, and Alaskans. After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for Secretary of Defense. I did not make this decision lightly; I take my constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent with the utmost seriousness.

I commend Pete Hegseth’s service to our nation, including leading troops in combat and advocating for our veterans. However, these accomplishments do not alleviate my significant concerns regarding his nomination. Managing the Department of Defense requires vast experience and expertise as the department is one of the most complex and powerful organizations in the world, and Mr. Hegseth’s prior roles in his career do not demonstrate to me that he is prepared for such immense responsibility. His leadership of two veteran organizations was marked with accusations of financial mismanagement and problems with the workplace culture he fostered.

Although he has recently revised his statements on women in combat since being nominated, I remain concerned about the message that confirming Mr. Hegseth sends to women currently serving and those aspiring to join. Women have served our nation with distinction, overcoming immense obstacles to excel in combat and leadership roles, and they deserve to know that their leader honors and values their commitment to our nation.

While the allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking do nothing to quiet my concerns, the past behaviors Mr. Hegseth has admitted to, including infidelity on multiple occasions, demonstrate a lack of judgment that is unbecoming of someone who would lead our armed forces. These behaviors starkly contrast the values and discipline expected of servicemembers. Men and women in uniform are held accountable for such actions, and they deserve leaders who uphold these same standards.

Above all, I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense, and must be prioritized without compromise. The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth’s nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook. Given the global security environment we’re operating in, it is critical that we confirm a Secretary of Defense, however, I regret that I am unable to support Mr. Hegseth.",en,Tweet,1605,46549,6664,54724,11817625,2025-01-23 18:33:30,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

This mess is the culmination of a failed energy policy that prioritizes resources from countries like Iran, Venezuela, and Mozambique over states like Alaska. Over the past four years, the Biden administration has ignored the Alaska Native people who live on the Coastal Plain and systematically dismantled the reasonable program established by the Trump administration under the law we wrote in 2017. It’s also quite rich for Biden administration officials to suggest that companies should develop elsewhere. Where, exactly, in Alaska, or in any federal area, is that even possible under the policies they have imposed? Thankfully, moving forward, we have plenty of options to ensure that our state can produce more of its resources, including from the Coastal Plain, rather than being punished and sanctioned for having them.

'1876415981024956745',"Earlier today, President Biden signed two memoranda withdrawing a total of 625 million acres of the federal Outer Continental Shelf—including the entire East Coast, the West Coast, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and tens of millions more acres off of Alaska—from potential oil and gas development.

I have long agreed that not all offshore areas need to be available for development at all times, and that some areas merit more permanent protections. I also understand the desire of Alaska Tribes in the Bering Straits region to prevent any oil and gas development in their nearby waters, as unlikely as that may be.

Still, my objection to the President’s actions today is two-fold. First, in Alaska, we continue to see a one-way ratchet where more and more of our federal OCS is taken off the table, while nothing is done to promote development even where it is needed and supported. Cook Inlet is a good example: instead of working with Alaskans to prevent looming energy shortages in Southcentral, the administration has actively worked against our ability to produce more natural gas from that basin. What we have faced over the past four years is an unbalanced policy that has left us on the verge of importing LNG.

I also object to the manner in which this announcement was made—post-election, at the 11th hour, and unilaterally through executive action. These withdrawals are sweeping, limiting the options that future administrations and Congresses have for where our energy should be produced and preventing more thoughtful decisions about what should be made available in each five-year national leasing program.

I understand that President Biden is trying to burnish his environmental legacy, but this is the wrong way to do it.",en,Tweet,18,393,62,257,30521,2025-01-06 23:50:06,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1840840426581819700',"Last week, I submitted a Statement to the Congressional Record detailing the importance of funds secured in 2021 to support young people across Alaska experiencing homelessness. 

These funds have had a significant impact on young people across the state by providing resources and support that enable them to succeed in their education. I urge my colleagues to come together to find solutions to support young people experiencing
homelessness at this critical stage in life.

'1839750839394521566',"It was incredible to be present at a ceremony to witness the United States military’s historic apology for the devastating 1869 bombardment of Kake. I have heard for many years how the people of Kake have not been able to heal from the trauma of the Navy’s attack. Families have shared the stories of the destruction, which led to deaths among children and elders. These families have had to live with that sadness and unresolved trauma for too long. One of the cultural values the people of Kake carry is spiritual and cultural balance. When trying to find that balance, apologies need to be made, to say ‘I am sorry, we failed you.’ 

While far overdue, it is appropriate now that our military offered this apology to the people of Kake for their loss. I commend the clan leaders in Kake for their humble acceptance of the Navy’s apology, and hope that this acknowledgment will promote healing from the intergenerational trauma caused by the United States government’s mistakes. It was my great honor to have worked alongside the community of Kake to advocate for this historic event.",en,Tweet,2,46,6,15,5861,2024-09-27 20:35:55,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYgbmUFWgAAP1Hi.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYgbmUIWQAAJGD7.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYgbmULWcAATaCa.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYgbmUFXcAAeiiw.jpg"
