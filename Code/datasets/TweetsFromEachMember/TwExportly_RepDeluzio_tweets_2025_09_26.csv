Earlier this month, I joined @RepJoeNeguse to highlight the dangers of Project 2025 and to protect the American people. https://t.co/Nc5dUdcNOh",en,Tweet,2,28,8,4,962,2024-09-30 20:22:23,"<a href=""https://studio.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Media Studio</a>",,,video,https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1840833667591000064/vid/avc1/1080x1080/aQkyJdPMrC93bkz-.mp4?tag=16

Let's get this done and fight back against the crisis of veteran suicide.
