'1961090095773352323',"70 years ago today, 14-year-old Emmett Till was lynched after he was accused of whistling at a white woman. His brave mother made sure Americans saw the brutality of his murder at his funeral.

We cannot forget and should not omit from our history his story—or the other stories of cruel and shameful events in our past. We must remember and honor Emmett Till and the many others who suffered in myriad ways in an unjust and unequal society. We must ensure we right the wrongs we still can, and we work for justice and equality. And we must reject the forces that want to erase the progress Americans have made since in protecting civil rights and voting rights.

As a co-sponsor of the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, I was proud to see President Biden sign it into law. It is a symbolic and important effort to learn from our past and demonstrate our values today. Learn more ⬇️

Yesterday, House Republicans voted to take that money away. 

This vote to take away funding for this investment in the densest and hottest part of Houston is part of a much larger effort to divert Congressional funding from investments like these and funding for programs that our community relies on.  This is just the first of many disastrous cuts for our community in this budget reconciliation process in Congress so that Republicans can give tax cuts to billionaires rather than address the needs of the majority of Americans.
