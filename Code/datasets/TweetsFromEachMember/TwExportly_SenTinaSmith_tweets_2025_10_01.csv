'1926687570127134723',"On this 5th anniversary of George Floyd’s murder, I’ve been remembering the anguish, trauma, and moral outrage of my Minnesota community. Since that terrible day there have been important victories and progress made, but also terrible losses and retreats. George Floyd’s killer is paying the price for his crimes, and nothing Donald Trump can do will change that. The Minneapolis Police Department and my city will continue to make slow but meaningful steps toward reform and systemic change. Donald Trump’s Justice Department has abandoned the Consent Decree, but we will not. Congress has failed so far to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, but local communities like mine have banned no-knock warrants and the use of choke holds.
 
It is also true that across our nation the number of police killings continues to go up, and the people who are dying are much more likely to be Native, Black and Latino people. Only a fool would look at how Donald Trump lifted up White Afrikaners as the victims of genocide and see anything but the race baiting and racism that it is. Big corporations that embraced Black businesses and a more diverse workforce only a year ago have erased those efforts as they shamefully kowtow to Trump and MAGA. So, there have been retreats and losses also.
