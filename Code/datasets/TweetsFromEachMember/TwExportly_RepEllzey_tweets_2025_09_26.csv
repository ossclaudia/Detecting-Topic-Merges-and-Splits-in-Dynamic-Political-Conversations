'1856063346933653612',"Veterans Day always makes me stop and think about the Privilege, Service, and Sacrifice of our veterans. Every service member has a unique story, but we all share one thing in common: the privilege of serving this great country. We raised our right hands, swore an oath, and gave a part of ourselves to defend and protect the freedoms we hold dear. And we did it willingly, knowing full well that service would ask a lot from us—and our families.

The sacrifices of military life are different for each person, but they’re no less real. For me, as a Navy guy, service meant long hours on the flight line, days spent getting ready for missions that would take me into the sky or out on the water. There were plenty of thrills, but there were also the long hours of prepping and debriefing, making sure every part of the aircraft was good to go, and taking care of the young sailors who worked hard to make it all happen. Every mission, every day, was a reminder that service isn’t just about the big moments—it’s about the daily grind and the commitment to something bigger than yourself.

Today is a day to say “thank you” to all those who served, who made it through and came back home to build their lives alongside the rest of us. For me, that means spending time with my wife and kids, enjoying the freedoms our veterans fought for and making up for some of the time I missed while I was standing watch.

So, if you see a veteran today, take a minute to thank them. For what they did, for who they defended, and for the country they served.",en,Tweet,0,17,3,2,758,2024-11-11 19:56:00,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcIPwqzXIAAe285.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcIPwqyXAAAeI4B.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcIPwqyXAAEx6rP.jpg"
