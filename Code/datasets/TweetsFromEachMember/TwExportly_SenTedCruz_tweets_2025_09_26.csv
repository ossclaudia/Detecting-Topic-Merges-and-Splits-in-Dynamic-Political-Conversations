One of those is the Orwellian-named “Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act,” which was nullified by Congress on bipartisan grounds but preserved by Biden.

'1945961302318289299',"My meeting with Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll focused on the Army Transformation Initiative (ATI) and the vital, strategic role Texas plays in advancing the Army’s modernization goals.

Given the Army presence at the Corpus Christi and Red River Army Depots, Army Futures Command, Forts Hood and Bliss, Joint Base San Antonio and other critical military installations, it’s clear that Texas offers unmatched advantages in infrastructure, workforce, and geographic positioning. Texas is the most capable and ready state to accelerate Army transformation.

The conversation reinforced that Texas has long served as the backbone of American defense—home to hundreds of thousands of servicemembers, military families, and a robust defense industrial base. With world-class installations and proven readiness, Texas is uniquely positioned to lead the next era of the U.S. Army.

I affirmed that Texas should not just be a participant, but a core partner in what ATI represents: forward-leaning innovation, operational agility, and strategic readiness. The discussion highlighted the critical importance of protecting and expanding the missions at Red River Army Depot (RRAD), Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA), and Army Futures Command (AFC)—each of which plays an indispensable role in supporting the Army’s current and future force.

The meeting also included proposals to relocate additional Army missions and capabilities to Texas. These actions would strengthen ATI implementation while maximizing efficiency, speed, and national security outcomes.

This meeting reflects Texas’s continued leadership and commitment to ensuring the U.S. Army remains the most capable, modern, and ready force in the world - with Texas at its core.",en,Tweet,2,215,44,76,29145,2025-07-17 22:38:23,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GwFwgxiXoAA6ABE.jpg

Instead, it’s funding otter ponds at the D.C. zoo and job training programs. When I flagged these failures over a year ago, they ignored solutions to expand access and end BEAD’s bias for fiber line.

Result? Less choice, no internet.

'1861097688789291066',"Last week, the Senate passed a bill to rename the U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint on U.S. Highway 90 West in Uvalde County, Texas, after James Ray Dominguez — and the bill is being sent to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.

In 2012, Border Patrol Agent James Dominguez was killed when he stopped to assist a stranded motorist & was struck by a passing vehicle while helping clear debris along US Hwy 90 near Cline, Texas.

This renaming will serve as reminder of the legacy Agent Dominguez left behind — a life dedicated to his community, Texas, and America.

ONE out of FOUR NSF grants now flow to support left-wing ideological crusades disguised as “academic research.” Here are just a few NSF grants from the Biden-Harris administration that my investigation has exposed:
•$5 MILLION to build “an intersectional learning ecosystem toward gendered racial equity” in AI education.
•$4.4 MILLION to “decolonize geoscience.”
•$401,744 to transform teachers and students into climate justice action researchers and change agents.
•$99,791 to examine how “Whiteness and White Supremacy” are embedded in U.S. higher education.
•$323,684 to transform engineering classrooms toward racial equity
•$349,985 to support and promote “decolonization and social justice reforms [that] are changing the Humanitarian Engineering sector” and to “identify learning experiences that enable engineering for social justice.”
•$335,644 for a project to create a “New Generation of Engineering Education DEI Leaders.”

'1841564837198913807',"Anti-energy activists are weaponizing our permitting and legal system to block growth. The DC Circuit recently blocked NextDecade’s Rio Grande Liquefied Natural Gas facility, endangering thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in South Texas. 

In the Senate, I’ve teamed up with Senator @JohnCornyn to introduce the PROTECT LNG Act, legislation which would prevent these abuses.

Now leaders from Brownsville, Harlingen, Weslaco, McAllen, Edinburg, Mission, and Laredo have penned a new op-ed explaining why the pipeline is so important.

'1841528884845806047',"It has been a long and hard-fought effort to improve infrastructure for I-27, but this news is another tremendous step in boosting jobs, economic development, and better transportation for Texans in communities across the Lone Star State. 

The integration of this stretch of I-27 is a welcome sight for leaders and business owners along the I-27 corridor, who will greatly benefit from improved supply chains and safer highways. 

I was proud to author the bipartisan legislation designating I-27, which will produce thousands of high-paying jobs and billions in new investments in Texas. 

I will continue to advocate for more stretches of the famed “Ports-to-Plains” corridor to be swiftly incorporated into I-27 pursuant to the law I authored with my colleagues in Congress.
