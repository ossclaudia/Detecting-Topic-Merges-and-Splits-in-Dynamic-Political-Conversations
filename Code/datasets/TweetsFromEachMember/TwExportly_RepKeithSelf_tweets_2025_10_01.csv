Multiple spending issues have now been addressed, and with that, I am confident that we can move forward to ensure that this historic piece of legislation will have a lasting impact for future generations. 

While the bill is not perfect, there are significant conservative wins the House Freedom Caucus has achieved, including, among other things, securing nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid savings. 

HFC moved the bill dramatically to the right on almost every front and at every stage of the process, including overnight, as a small group of us continued working with the White House to address critical policy and spending issues.

In negotiations with House leadership, commitments were made to ensure the One Big Beautiful Bill would include key provisions, such as:

 - Matching every $1 of tax cuts with $1 of spending cuts.

- Terminating Biden's Green New Scam.

- Prohibiting taxpayer-funded experimental gender transition procedures.

The Senate broke the House framework, and then they stomped all over it. Now, House leadership wants to cram this broken bill down our throats by rushing it to the floor while in the middle of discussions, completely disregarding their promises.

The only way of making this right is by leadership adhering to their commitments and restoring, at a minimum, these three important issues from the House version.

While honoring one's commitment may be a rare commodity in Washington, each member of Congress is obligated to return home and explain their actions to the constituents they serve.

Ultimately, this is an issue of morality. Abiding by our word is the only thing we have; therefore, as the bill currently stands, I voted against the rule.

Yaron purchased an engagement ring for Sarah recently and planned to propose to her on their upcoming trip to Israel. Today, rather than looking forward to celebrating the bonds of marriage, the families and friends of Yaron and Sarah are joining together in the bonds of grief.

This senseless tragedy on American soil is a stark reminder of many tragic losses brought to bear by radical terrorists.

'1925517768012480819',"This morning, I took what may be the toughest vote of my career by voting YES on the House reconciliation bill.

I came to Congress to fight Washington’s out-of-control spending. It has been my top priority since my first day in office. We must save America’s future generations from financial ruin.

Congress took President Trump’s incredible policies and paired them with more Washington spending—in another “must-pass” bill.

-It does nothing to stop Washington’s out-of-control spending.

-This bill could take us from $36 trillion in debt to $56 trillion or more in 10 years.

-It drives us towards socialized medicine by omitting significant reforms to Medicaid.

-It fails to repeal Biden’s Green New Scam.

Let me be clear: President Trump is leading the most aggressive pro-America administration perhaps in our nation’s history. The issues some conservatives have in this case fall squarely at the feet of Congress.

I am proud of the positive changes the House Freedom Caucus fought to get into this bill.

Self is also dissatisfied with the fact that many of the bill’s new work requirements—which on paper are said to save billions—wouldn’t go into effect until 2029. 

He said postponement means that the reforms won’t end up happening at all.

“If you have the reforms start in 2029 or even further out, they’re not going to happen. Because again, that’s fantasyland in Washington, D.C.,” he said.

From this AM’s edition—3 fixes for the Big, Beautiful Bill 👇

“First, the conservative upstarts were right to protest the meager Medicaid reforms. The work requirements for able-bodied adults don't kick in until after Trump is out of office in 2029? Absurd. They should start tomorrow.

Second, most of the $750+ billion in Biden “Green New Scam” giveaways  don't end until after 2028. Chip Roy is right: ‘Move those up, to front load the savings.’

Finally, add back the 15% corporate tax rate either for all companies - or at a minimum for made-in-America producers. The House leadership argues the current bill makes the EFFECTIVE rate 15% when all the deductions are added in. If that's true, then eliminate them all and drop the rate. Permanently. Then everyone will cheer. Deductions are bad. Rate cuts are good. Duh!
