A proud graduate of UC Davis, he always understood the importance of education and gave back generously whether through his support of Fresno State’s Maddy Institute or mentoring the next generation of agricultural leaders.

John was a pioneer in the development and production of healthy food products that made the Harris Ranch Beef one of the most respected food producers in America. His love of horses and agriculture defined his life.
